presentations and from the individual journal articles just so you guys know well ahead of time what we want you to prepare for the group presentations we're looking for fifteen to twenty minutes on what you guys have done as a group so that would be a few slides summarizing each of the weeks that we've gone through so far so the first week on what are all of your design options presented in some sort of compact way more compact than I presented in the lecture then I'd be interested to see how did you choose which design parameters are important which parts did you eliminate easily which design choices did you eliminate right away and then how did you choose your eventual design path and so if all that can be in a 15 to 20 minute coherent presentation that's great it's up to you guys whether everyone wants to present tag team or you do one person again if anyone is kind of shy I encourage you to present if anyone has some serious problems presenting I'm not going to force you to do it but I really want everyone to give it a shot so just keep that in mind as far as the journal communications I'm looking for about a", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " thousand words

the editor so if you want to see more examples of these short journal articles you can see them online on any Springer Elsevier Wiley Journal under those sorts of names so what I'm looking for there is a bit of introduction on the design problem so that's what you guys are working on as a whole and that could be one or two paragraphs of what are you doing and why are you all doing it I'd be looking for a background section on what your team is doing so you can describe your specific problem like the core problem or the biofuels problem and some of the options available and then I'd be interested from each of you to hear what you individually have researched you know in process he did you take care of heat storage or heat exchangers what sort of design parameters have you found and what are you going to go with in the end and why this is just a way for me to see what each of you individually has been doing as well as work on some scientific communication and writing skills I forget is this a CI M class or no no okay well everything you do in the real engineering world is pretty CI M so I'd say get used to it not going to have you do as much as a CI M but it'll be a good

quality would it be interest would it be illustrative to do an example of that so you guys can see how it works okay so I don't want to give anyone an unfair advantage so let's pick a problem that nobody is researching what sort of consumer item would you want to do a house of quality on anyone have any thoughts car all right car computers will what's the vote who wants to do what car raise your hands some sort of computer bicycle iPhone it's pretty pretty even car and computer and I don't have any coins to flip all right I heard car first so let's do that so this is a pretty reduced house of quality there are actually templates on the website to avoid you guys having to do any of the any of the math which is really just addition multiplication but it's time consuming the important parts of what you fill in for each of these things the first step that I usually like to take is here what I call customer requirements now usually you find your customer requirements with some sort of marketing survey to a certain market group this this whole concept was sort of borrowed from the manufacturing in and management world but it works pretty well when you're starting a big

I won my car to be safe I want my car to be fast so I won my car to be sighs doesn't quite work okay so is America we want big cars and this is good actually to have sort of conflicting conflicting requirements this is what happens a lot what else we're okay we're designing an SUV what else do we want okay reliable all right and one more cos I'm guessing cheek right okay so we want all of these

relative later so who cares what it is let's just say one to find a scale of one to five one being the least important five being the most important what do you think fast is once is most important or everyone reach a consensus three out of 500 five okay miles per gallon in an SUV I'm just I'm just uh wait what I have one yeah od we're just rating each of them on a scale of one to five doesn't you know they can all be fives if the customers think so the only reason I picked six variables is so we can finish it in this hour in reality there'll be a lot more when you guys are doing your designs I

three-point turns on the actual should have been one-point turns but whatever reliable or you can also say 3.5 I heard three and four you can you can make the scale as fine as you want it's all going to get relative in the end and cheap that's right we want what we can't have five okay so we have importances does anyone have a calculator okay can you talk an you find each of these in terms of

parameters so the customers are out there they've told you what they want in your design problems this would be electricity consumers or maybe utilities are up to you to decide but now you guys are

see what would some other ones be okay engine maybe engine power right I'll just put engine in watts or horsepower who cares what are some other physical parameters that you as the designers get to choose okay cost of production and this these steps can actually be some of the hardest things to figure out because you guys as a team will have to decide what you think your customers are going to want and what parameters you actually have to control by the way it can be a whole lot more than six and there are some pretty big house of quality templates out there so I need three more", "start":

engineers would be designing those oh yeah so okay so between bells and whistles and acceleration speed okay zero to 60 okay so not only is this house of quality or anything like it a good way to figure out what design parameters are most important it serves as a good catalog to catalog all your different thoughts on the interrelationships between these variables these variables and the ones

you can actually because you can actually put a value on each of these engineering parameters you want to just record is higher better is lower better does it not matter so for weight is heavier

car to be lighter and how use less materials but have the same safety everything that's what you'd be going for in terms of an optimization problem so what do you guys want to do okay all right so let's say the lower the weight the better everything else kept the same so assuming same safety same acceleration same expected life if you can decrease the weight that's better for in terms of design

efficiency or else nothing's going to work you can immediately see what other parameters are you going to affect and then once you have your the importances for your design parameters down here you can sort of have mental gauge of how much do you want to push one parameter at the cost of the other so for example how does weight relate to engine is it a positive correlation and negative correlation and is it strongly positive or weakly positive or negative or weakly negative more powerful well let's say in this sort of frame of mind you'd say you say if the weight of the car goes up what has to happen to the engine the engine has to get bigger right or if the if the engine gets bigger what can you then due to the weight of the car without sacrificing anything else you can make it

necessarily true smarter materials could cost more per pound but if you use like an aluminum honeycomb instead of a solid steel slab to protect for protection weight can go down with cost of production so I would say we can leave this one blank just because they're not necessarily correlated how about weight and expected lifetime you know borrowing things like crashes and stuff what do you guys think I'm not hearing much which is what I was thinking - there isn't much there so you can see this can get pretty time-consuming I expect debates to happen on filling in a number of these

probably not a negative correlation book you guys want to say no correlation or a slight positive or heavy positive ok so where these two meet is slight positive and weight and zero to 60 I'd say highly negative so the heavier it is the harder it is to accelerate engine and everything else kept the same and we repeat for the rest how about the engine size and the cost of production yeah so weak or strong positive it's only one component of the car so I'd say weak positive how about engine size and expected lifetime who knows engine quality is going to be like could be a big crappy

weak positive okay yeah you put a lot more good stuff in it it'll probably last longer as long as you put it together in the right way cost of production and dimensions not hearing anything so I'll just leave it like cost of production and zero to sixty acceleration okay yeah I wouldn't necessarily the same safety at a lower weight so strong or weak positive weak positive okay and home stretch

one dimensions and zero to sixty everything else keeping the same including the weight okay how come excellent strong or weak negative yeah drag goes up with velocity squared with long with area okay so now you have an agreed-upon or roughly agreed-upon framework of whether you want to maximize minimize or leave the same your parameters and the relationships between them so you can quickly refer back to this chart and start to figure out all right if I have to start increasing the weight what do I impact I impact my 0 to 60 speed how was is weight more important than 0 to 60 that's what we're

be debated in your team's but when the integrators take a look at them they might say I don't know yours conflicts with yours we'll have to see about that so this is a big part of the design process and if you do this ahead of time you'll save yourselves a lot of work in the end the first thing you've got to do is agree on a scale a scale from zero to n with as many gradations between as you want what tends to show up and a lot of the templates are strong strong medium weak or no Association and I'll just use the same symbols as they do in the templates ah see this is strong medium week and

expensive okay but that can also factor into maybe cost of production so what you want to do on top as you can see some of these encompass two or more independent variables so what you want to end up

looking for not necessarily the answers you want but the correct information out of the customer zero to sixty and miles per gallon you got a super-fast card like burning gas now okay yeah I'd buy

discrepancies between the design you're looking at and all the others are there big or small discrepancies how do they weight according to customer requirements so something that we're obviously
