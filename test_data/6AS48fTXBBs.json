But I thought I'd say a few things about chapter 1, and then see if there are any questions. I can't see the pointer. Oh, anybody remember how to get Word to [CHUCKLES] make its pointer not disappear? Maybe I mentioned this the first lecture, but I was taken by this cute poem by Dorothy Parker because the first chapter was about love and stuff like that. So I tried to get the rights to reproduce it, and it turned out that she was angry at all her friends. She must have been a perpetually pissed-off person.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " And so she left all her literary rights to the NAACP.

Shakespeare's a slightly better poet, but he's not as funny as Dorothy Parker. [CHUCKLES] So the first chapter starts out-- or, it's mostly about all the things we don't understand about the mind, which is almost everything. And the first discussion is-- well, the whole chapter is making fun of the most popular ideas. And the most popular idea of the mind is that people think that they are not doing the thinking, but there's something inside them that's doing the thinking. And it's this idea that there is a self-- is embedded in just about everything we say and think.", "start": 90.0, "heat": 0.126}, {"text": " And really, it's hard to see how you would do without it. But if you ask, what is the self? Then since this idea is so popular, people begin to believe that there is such a thing and it takes all sorts of various forms. And the most dangerous form, maybe, is the one that religions exploit. Which is that inside a person, with all their complications, there's a little pure essence called the soul, or the self, or whatever you want to call it, and it's impossible to describe it or explain it in physical terms. And so that is one of the reasons why we think there are two worlds-- a physical world and lots of other kinds of worlds. And each of us has some imaginary model of what they are and what they're in. And philosophers talk about it and existentialists, and so on. So there are lots of problems about our ideas about ourselves. And in reading around for half my life,", "start": 180.0, "heat": 0.122}, {"text": " I was puzzled at the strange ideas that are around. And in Aristotle, I find the first intelligible theories of mind and emotions. So if you look at, in particular, Aristotle's-- there are a number of books and one of them is called Rhetoric. And it's full of theories about how people reason and influence each other. And I'll show you some quotes from that because when I look at the history that I've encountered about psychology, sort of Aristotle stands out as being the first and among the best. And as far as I can see, there were no psychologists nearly as good as him. Of course, we don't know whether there was a him exactly because he-- what we have of Aristotle is a lot of writing, but it's all cobbled together by students from all sorts of manuscripts by other people, and people who took notes. And Aristotle claims to have learned a lot from Plato. Well, we have very little writing from him.", "start": 270.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " And so there you go-- three centuries before the Christian era, as it's called. And then a couple of thousand years later, you start to find people like Spinoza and Kant and John Locke and David Hume, who start to make psychology theories, very little of which is as good as the ones that Aristotle has in all his fragments. So one question that frequently bothers me, and it should bother everyone, is why did science disappear for 1,000 years? And the standard explanation is the rise of the great religions. And why did it come back? And you see with the first signs of anything like modern science, at least in my view, with Galileo and Newton-- there a couple of people before that. There's some people in the Muslim world who invented some high school algebra, and they make a big fuss about that.

And Rudolph Fleiss, who-- Sigmund Freud starts writing in 1895. People make fun of Freud, as I mentioned last week. But in fact, among other things-- how many of you have read the recent criticisms of Freud, which claim that he was a complete faker and never cured a single patient? This is popular stuff. I don't believe Freud ever really claimed to cure a single patient. So the critics, who are really very ferocious, claimed that he made up all his data, and so forth.

I actually forgot which fish it is, but there's a picture of it some-- in the book. And at different points in its life, it's in different phases.

So here, the great psychologists of our day-- Aristotle, 2,000 years ago, and Lorenz and Tinbergen in the 1930s, and Sigmund Freud and Galton and William James around 1900. And then what went wrong? There's almost no good psychology between then and 1950s, when something called cognitive psychology started. And it was partly due to people who said, let's make psychology more scientific. And you've probably all heard of Pavlov or Watson. And what happened is, around 1900, some psychologists said, well, these Galtons and Freuds and William James are very poetic and expressive and literary, and they write much better than we do and tells good stories. But they're not scientists and they don't do reproducible experiments. So what we have to do is simplify the situation to find the basic laws of behavior.

And you'd plot curves of how often the animal pressed these levers so you would get a quantitative theory of how much he learned and how much it could remember, and how many trials it would have to do. And then instead of just looking at reactions to stimuli, they quickly switched to trying to teach the animal things by giving it to two alternatives-- turn left or turn right, or push this button or that, or whatever. And if they pushed the one you approve of, then you'd give them a little pellet of food. And there was a lot of engineering so that you would make sure that the food got to them right away.

But it goes, essentially, without repeating-- it's very complicated-- for 20 minutes. And people have studied that a lot and no one has the slightest idea of what it means. And nobody even has any good conjectures, which bothers me. But I think it probably means is this, when there's a whole bunch of fish somewhere for one of these whales, it might be 200 miles away, and it's very-- whales eat a lot.

Anyway, that's-- I'm bothered by the mystery of why was there some psychology in Aristotle's time? And why didn't it get anywhere till 1950, when there was regular psychology, but it was afflicted by what I call, physics envy.

And so they get these little sets of rules that look like Newton's laws, and that was the kind of sort of psychological physics that the so-called behaviorists were mostly looking for. This was not what Tinbergen and Lorenz did because they wrote books with extensive descriptions of what the animals did and made little diagrammatic guesses about the structure of the subroutines and sub-structures. Anyway, end of history, but it's a nice question-- why do some sciences grow, and why was psychology just about the last one?

And my PhD thesis was a theory of neural networks, which was sort of interesting, but never really went anywhere. I went to a meeting in London somewhere and gave a talk about a theory of learning that was based on some neural network ideas.

Is there a magical force inside the engine that causes the wheels to turn? No. There's this funny thing in the back to cause a differential so that if the car isn't going in a straight line, the two wheels going at different speeds won't rip the-- if the two wheels were going at the same speed, the tread would come off in 5 minutes.

So it just occurred to me that it seems like if you go back to the list of feelings, it seems like when we talk about feeling, we're talking about a state that the brain is in. So it might be a complicated state that's like some combination of a lot of different parameters. But it's a state that you can stay in for like an arbitrary amount of time. But I think thinking is something that's more sequential, as in like when you're thinking, you're necessarily changing the state of your brain all the time because you're moving bits around. So I don't know. I just thought of this. MARVIN MINSKY: No, I think that's right. That I think when we talk about intelligent behavior, you're absolutely right. What you've got is a process that's criticizing itself and seeing when you got stuck and finding things to do. And I suppose in each emotional state, you're certainly also thinking. So that's going on, but maybe it's more restricted. Like if you're confronting somebody, and there's a sort of conflict, then almost all your thoughts are constrained to that subject. And it's not as resourceful. But I'm just improvising.

I think what I'm talking about in this context is sort of extreme forms, where the person changes into another machine. Like, an angry person won't listen to reason, or it's very hard to deflect them, and so it's this kind of rigid thing. But humans are generally-- are rarely in such extreme states, where nothing gets through. But the whole point of that was that-- I just realize that I maybe was just too lazy-- that we have this huge vocabulary of nuances of emotional activity. Also, people think that these are hard to explain and mysterious and non-physical and blah, blah, blah.

AUDIENCE: So Professor Minsky, you talked a lot about emotions in today's lecture. And my understanding is that like for someone who has this distinct personality, they might have a predisposition to feel a certain emotion of like anger, depression, or whatnot. My question is that if you had any insight or theories on to what extent our personality is affected by events or influences that happen to us over the course of a lifetime. And to what extent is it impacted by chemical or biological makeup of our brain? MARVIN MINSKY: Well, you're asking what do people learn? We don't care if it's chemical or-- see, if it's chemical, it's still physical. AUDIENCE: I've read a little bit about treatments for depression. And the argument is that a lot of the reasons for depression is because of some sort of chemical and biological way our brain is constructed.

If you have too many excitatory things, and there was a loop, then it would explode. And it would wear itself out in jig time. So there is this general feature of the anatomy that you alternate. So when somebody talks about a drug having an inhibitory effect, that's sort of weird because it's inhibiting half the neurons. And therefore, it's lowering the thresholds of the ones they're connected to and so on.

As far as I can see, emotional mechanisms are generally lower-level, simpler ones than the ones that involve several layers of the-- more layers of the brain. So it's just a relative thing.

And the United States is different from other places because we don't elect congressmen or presidents. We elect smart people from the community who then get together and decide who should be president. And of course, now, if anybody-- now they belong to parties. And if any of them voted for the other party's candidate, there would be hell to pay.
