[{"text": " PROFESSOR: Hi. Well, I hope you're ready for second derivatives. We don't go higher than that in many problems, but the second derivative is an important-- the derivative of the derivative is an important thing to know, especially in problems with maximum and minimum, which is the big application of derivatives, to locate a maximum or a minimum, and to decide which one it is. And I can tell you right away, locating a maximum, minimum, is the first derivative's job. The first derivative is 0. If I have a maximum or a minimum, and we'll have pictures, somewhere in the middle of my function I'll recognize by derivative equals 0. Slope equals 0, that the function is leveling off, either bending down or bending up, maximum or minimum.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " OK, and it's the second derivative that tells me which it is. The second derivative tells me the bending of the graph. OK, so we now will have three generations. The big picture of calculus started with two functions: the distance and the speed. And we discussed in detail the connection between them. How to recover the speed if we know the distance, take the derivative. Now comes the derivative of the speed, which in that language, in the distance-speed-time language, the second derivative is the acceleration, the rate at which your speed is changing, the rate at which you're speeding up or slowing down. And this is the way I would write that. If the speed is the first derivative-- df dt-- this is the way you write the second derivative, and you say d second f dt squared. d second f dt squared. OK, so that's you could say the physics example: distance, speed, acceleration. And I say physics because, of course, acceleration is the a", "start": 90.0, "heat": 0.414}, {"text": " in Newton's Law f equals ma. For a graph, like these graphs here, I won't especially use those physics words. I'll use graph words. So I would say function one would be the height of the graph. And in this case, that height is y equals x squared, so it's a simple parabola. Here would be the slope. I would use the word \"slope\" for the second function. And the slope of y equals x squared we know is 2x, so we see the slope increasing. And you see on this picture the slope is increasing. As x increases, I'm going up more steeply. Now, it's the second derivative. And what shall I call that? Bending. Bending is the natural word for the second derivative on a graph. And what do I-- the derivative of 2x is 2, a constant, a positive constant, and that positive constant tells me that the slope is going upwards and that the curve is bending upwards. So in this simple case, we connect these three", "start": 180.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " descriptions of our function. It's positive. It's slope is positive. And its second derivative-- bending-- is positive. And that gives us a function that goes like that. Now, let me go to a different function. Let me take a second example now, an example where not everything is positive. But let's make it familiar. Take sine x. So sine x starts out like that. So this is a graph of sine x up to 90 degrees, pi over 2, so that's y equals sine x. OK, what do you think about its slope? We know the derivative of sine x, but before we write it down, look at the graph. The slope is positive, right? But the slope actually starts out at 1. Better make it look a little more realistic. That's a slope of 1 there. So the slope starts at 1 and the slope drops to a slope of 0 up there. So a slope of 1. I see here is a 1.", "start": 270.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " Here I'm graphing y prime. dy dx I sometimes write as y prime, just because it's shorter, and particularly, it'll be shorter for a second derivative. So y prime, we know the derivative of sine x is cos x, which is pretty neat actually, that we start with a familiar function, and then we get its twin, its other half. And the cosine is the slope of the sine curve, and it starts at 1, a slope of 1, and it comes down to 0, as we know the cosine does. So that's a graph of the cosine. And now, of course, we have three generations. I'm going to graph y double prime. Let me put it up here. y double prime, the second derivative, the derivative of the cosine of x is minus sine x. OK, let's just-- from the picture, what am I seeing here? I'm seeing a slope of 0. I'm taking now the slope of the slope. So here it starts at 0. The slope is downwards, so the second derivative is going to be negative.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " Oh, and it is negative, minus sign x. So the slope starts at 0 and ends at minus 1 because that now comes down at a negative slope. The slope is negative. I'm going downhill, and that's a graph of the second derivative.

And I see it in the bending curve because I'm below 0 here. This is bending down, where that one was bending up. I could introduce the word convex for something that bends upwards, and bending down, I could introduce the word concave. But those are just words. The graphs are telling us much more than the words do.", "start": 450.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " OK, so do you see that picture bending down, but going up? So the slope is positive here, but the second derivative, the slope is dropping. So the second derivative-- and you have to pay attention to keep them straight. The second derivative is telling us that the original one is bending down. OK, let me continue these graphs just a little beyond 90 degrees, pi over 2, because you'll see something interesting. So what happens in the next part of the graph? So this is going-- the sine curve, of course, continues on its way downwards. So the slope is going negative, as I know the cosine curve will do, as the cosine curve will come like that. The slope down to minus 1, the slope-- do you see here? The slope is negative, so on this slope graph, I'm below 0. And the slope is 0. Let me put a little mark at these points here, at these three points. Those are important points.

The bending tells you that the slope is going down, so the bending is negative. The bending is negative at a maximum. Good. OK, now I'm going to continue this sine curve for another 90 degrees, the cosine curve, and I'll continue the bending curve, so I have minus sine x, which will go back up. OK, now what? Now what? And then, of course, it would continue along. OK, there's something interesting happening at 180 degrees, at pi. Can I identify that point? So there's 180 degrees. Something's happening there.

And we identified it as a max because the second derivative was negative. Now I'm interested in this point. Can you see what's happening at this point as far as bending goes? This curve is bending down. But when I continue, the bending changes to up. This is a point where the bending changes. The second derivative changes sign, and we see it here. Up to this square point, the bending is below 0. The bending is downwards as I come to here. But then there's something rather special that-- you see, can I try to blow that point up? Here the bending is down, and there it turns to up, and right in there with the-- this is called-- so this is my final word to introduce--", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " inflection point. Don't ask me why. An inflection point is a point where the second derivative is 0. And what does that mean? That means at that moment, it stopped bending down, and it's going to start bending up. The second derivative is passing through 0. The sign of bending is changing. It's changing from concave here to convex there. That's a significant point on the graph. Not as big a thing as the max or the min that we had over there. So let me draw one more example and identify all these different points. OK, so here we go. I drew it ahead of time because it's got a few loops, and I wanted to get it in good form. OK, here it is. This is my function: x cubed minus x squared.

And then the fourth derivatives and all the rest would be 0 for this case. OK, now somehow, those derivatives, those formulas for y, y prime, y double prime should tell me details about this graph.

I'll set it to be 0 because I want to look for max, or min. And I look for both at the same time by setting y prime equals 0, and then I find out which I've got by looking at y double prime.

Well, I see them on the curve here. That is a point where the slope is 0. And I see one down here. There is a point where the slope is 0, but I can find them with algebra. I solve 3x squared equals to 2x, and I see it's a quadratic equation. I expect to find two roots. One of them is x equals 0, and the other one is what? If I cancel those x's to find a non-zero, canceling those x's leaves me with 3x equals 2 or x equals 2/3. Yeah, and that's what our graph shows. OK, now we can see on the graph which is a max and which is a min. And by the way, let me just notice, of course, this is the max. But let me just notice that it's what I would call a local maximum. It's not the absolute top of the function because the", "start": 990.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " function later on is climbing off to infinity.

Good. Negative second derivative tells me I'm bending down, as the graph confirms, and the place where the slope is 0 is a maximum and not a minimum. What about the other one? What about at x equals 2/3? At that point, y double prime, looking at my formula here for y double prime, is what? 6 times 2/3 is 4 minus 2 is plus 2. 4 minus 2 is 2.

The inflection point is when the bending changes from-- up to here I see that bending down. From here, I see it bending up. So I will not be surprised if that's the point where the bending is changing, and 1/3 is the inflection point. And now how do we find an inflection point? How do we identify this point?

OK, I suppose we're in a-- we had a local maximum there, a happy time a little while ago, but it went downhill, right? If y is, say, the gross product for the world or gross national product, it started down. The slope of that curve was negative. The bending was even negative. It was going down faster all the time. Now, at a certain moment, the economy kept going down, but you could see some sign of hope. And what was the sign of hope? It was the fact that it started bending up.

OK, so that's an example of how the second derivative comes in. Now, I started by giving this lecture the title Max and Min and saying those are the biggest applications of the derivative.

In fact, even better if I subtract x squared from both sides. My equation is telling me that a squared should be 3x squared.

So then we had examples. There was an example of a minimum when the second derivative was positive. Here was an example of a local maximum when the second derivative was negative. Here with the sine and cosine, those are nice examples. And it takes some patience to go through them. I suggest you take another simple function, like start with cosine x. Find its maximum. Find its minimum. Find its inflection points so the inflection points are where the bending is 0 because it's changing from bending one way to bending the other way.
