I forgot to turn on my microphone. And you missed some incredibly brilliant things. But such is life. Let me go back to where I was, which was we we're looking at this code to find the cube root of a perfect cube. We saw this last week, and indeed, you also saw it in recitation. I'm not going to belabor it. I do want to ask you the question, for what values will this program terminate? That is to say the only input is to x. For what values of x is this program guaranteed to always stop? Anybody want to volunteer an answer to that? Ask a simpler question. Let's assume that x is a number. In fact, let's assume it's an integer. Will it terminate for all positive integers, all",

And every time I write a loop, I think about one of these, because that explains to me why the loop is guaranteed to terminate. We'll go over here where we have a bigger board and look at the properties that a decrementing function needs to have. One, it will map some set of program variables to an integer.",

So what's the decrementing function for this loop? How did I know it will always terminate? Yeah? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: Answer equals answer plus 1. I don't think so. Does that satisfy all of these properties? Remember, a function is going to map some set of program variables to an integer. So what are the interesting program variables here? Well, there are only two, ans and x. Right? At least, that's all I can see. So what would be an interesting function? Somebody? Surely, there's someone who can figure this out. Yes?

Right? So I know that every time through the loop, it will be 8. The first time through, it'll be 8 minus 1 cubed, which is 7. And then the next time through, it'll be 8 minus 2 cubed, which is 0. And then, I exit the loop. And it's that kind of reasoning that I used to convince myself that this loop terminates. And every time I write a loop, and I hope every time you write a loop, you will think about what's the reason the loop is going to terminate. And you will do it by thinking about what the decrementing function is. People get me on that? And whoever finally answered a question surely deserves to be fed. I obviously have to bring better candy to encourage better responses. Now, let's go back and look at the program itself. Now that we know it stops, and you can take my word for it",

And it's a particular kind called exhaustive enumeration. Each time through the loop, I'm taking a guess at to what the value is, and I'm checking whether it's true. But I'm enumerating the guesses in a very systematic way. They're not just random guesses. I'm enumerating all the possible answers. If I get through the entire space of answers, or possible answers, and I don't find a solution, then I know that it doesn't exist, and it's not a perfect cube. So that's why it's called exhaustive enumeration because I'm exhausting the space of possible answers. Does that makes sense to everyone? So let's try it. Let's try it with say a very large value of x, because",

What's the cube root of that? Well, this is a question I did not expect you to answer. But it's 1,251. That'll be in the first quiz, so make a note of it. Notice how quickly the computer did this. It found the cube root of quite a large number very quickly. And so while one might initially think that exhaustive enumeration is a silly technique because takes a lot of guesses, for an awful lot of problems, we can actually just write a pretty stupid program that's solves it by exhaustive enumeration. We typically refer to such programs as brute force. And brute force is often exactly the right way to solve a problem. Why does it work? Because computers are really fast. How fast are computers?

How many instructions can a computer execute between the time I say something and the time the people in the back row hear it? Mitch thinks it's 400 million instructions. I think that's about right. It's hundreds of millions at any rate. It's kind of amazing between the time I say something and the time you hear it, hundreds of millions of instructions. It's mind boggling how fast that is. And that's why we can often use these kind of solutions. Next lecture, actually, even a little bit later in this lecture, I hope to get to an example of why that doesn't really get the job done, at least not always. Before I do that, I want to look at one more programming construct. And that's a variant on the while loop. So if we think about what the while loop we were just looking at did or does, as the decrementing function told us, it's looking at all the possible values of answer ranging from 0 to the absolute value of x.

So I used a Python notation for exponentiation, which you'll see is star, star. Now, be easier to read if I get rid of that. But other than that, the interesting thing I did was replace the while loop by a for. So you'll see this line of code there, for ans in range 0 to abs of x plus 1. What that says is range is a built-in function of Python that generates, in this case, a sequence of integers, something called a tuple, which we'll be looking at in a lecture or so. But for now, it's pretty simple to think about what you",

So it gives me a sequence of length y-- well, assuming that's 0. Right? It doesn't have to be 0. It can be anything. It can be another value as well. 0 in my example. And then, the for loop executes it on this value and the next iteration on this value, and finally, at the very end on that value. So it executes it one iteration of the loop on each value in this sequence of values generated by the range statement. And normally, it does all of them.

And if you do that break, always executes-- always exits rather the innermost loop. So what this does is it's generates a set of values to test. It checks whether or not it's got the answer. If it does, it terminates the loop. And eventually, you exit the loop. And then, it just checks as before whether or not it found a correct answer and does the right thing. So you'll find, particularly when you're iterating over integers, but later we'll see when you're iterating over a lot of other kinds of things, for loops are a very convenient shorthand. There's nothing you can't do with a while loop. You don't need for loops. But they do make life easy. And over the semester, I think you'll end up writing a lot more for loops than you will while loops. Any questions about this? If not, I'm going to move right along. So this is the moment.",

Right? You've even got these $0.50 four function calculators that find square roots. And they don't insist that you only give it perfect squares. So now, let's think about how we would take this kind of program, and indeed, this kind of method of writing programs and use it to find-- for now, we'll look at the square root of any number, of any floating point number. Well, the first question we need to ask is what do I mean? That's kind of a subtle question. What does it mean to find the square root of a number? What does it mean, for example, to find the square root of 2? Well, we know that that was an endless series of digits before we can find the square root of 2. Right? It does not have a nice answer. So we can't just say we have to find something that if we multiply it by itself, it will equal 2. Because we can't find such a thing.",

I don't want to say it's equal to x, because that may be impossible or too time consuming to find. So really, what I mean is x plus or minus epsilon. So that's what I'm asking. Find one that's close enough. And that's what the next piece of code I want to show you does. Excuse me. So I'm starting, just giving it a value for x, so I don't have to keep typing one in. Let's say it's 25. I'm going to take epsilon to be 0.01. So I want it within that distance of the true answer.",

We're going to start by setting my first guess at 0.0. Again, this is going to be exhaustive enumeration. Then, I'm going to essentially encode this as a test of my while loop while the absolute value of answer squared minus x is greater than or equal to epsilon, and answer is less than equal to x. So it's now a more complicated test. I've got a Boolean value. Two things have to be true to execute the body of the loop. I'm going to increment answer by a tiny amount, increment the number of guesses just so I can keep track of it. Maybe I'm going to comment this out for the first go around just so we don't see too many print statements and keep doing it. And then when I'm done I'm going to see whether or not what I found is indeed a square root or close enough. So if we think about why this loop terminates, why am I guaranteed that this loop will terminate?",

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] answer squared minus x1 times 1. PROFESSOR: No. Close, sort of. But I appreciate you're trying. That's worth something just for the effort. Somebody else. Remember, if we look at the properties it has to have, it's going to guarantee me that when it gets to the right value, I exit the loop, which suggests it's going to certainly be part of the test of the while. Just look at this piece over here at the end. Answer starts at 0. I keep incrementing it. Eventually, answer minus x will hit a value, right? Eventually, I'll get to the point that this condition must be true-- must be false rather. And then, I exit the loop.",

It's kind of an optimization, if you will. So I'm just going to go until I find the answer. Let's see what happens when I run it. It tells me that 4.99, et cetera is close to the square root of 25. So there are some things to note about this. First, it didn't find 5, 25 happens to be a perfect square, yet I didn't find it. Is that OK? Yeah. Because that wasn't what I said. What I said is find a y that has these properties over here. And I did. I didn't say find the y that gets closest to the square root of x. I said find one that has these properties. Effectively, what this is is a specification of the problem. And I've now written a piece of code that meets the specification.",

We're going back to this issue of computational complexity, but here, not of the problem but of the solution. So this is algorithmic analysis. We're analyzing the algorithm, this exhaustive enumeration algorithm, and trying to figure out how long it's likely to take to run. Well, what does the running time of this algorithm depend upon? Yeah? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: It depends on the actual square root. Yes. But in particular, the distance of the actual square root from the starting point. So that's one factor it depends on. But that's not the only factor. What else does it depend on? Oh, do we have an injury? We had a dropped pass and a deflection there. All right. Yes? AUDIENCE: It depends on the level of accuracy, so how you define epsilon. PROFESSOR: It depends upon the value of epsilon. Absolutely.",

PROFESSOR: Someone with a concern for safety. it depends upon the actual value of epsilon, because if epsilon is small, we may have to take more steps to get a precise enough answer. And it depends upon one more thing. Yeah? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the increment that [INAUDIBLE]? PROFESSOR: The increment. Exactly. Because the number of times we go through the loop is going to be related to how big a step we take each time through. No applause? Thank you. So it depends upon all of these things. And here, since we're trying to find a pretty [? big ?] square root and a sort of precise answer, but we're taking tiny steps, it's going to take a long time to execute. So we could make it faster. For example, suppose I change the step size to this. Plus equal by says increment the value by whatever the right side is. So I'm going to increment it by 1.",

Some people a lot smarter than I am figured out a long time ago a good method for solving this kind of problem. And they're doing it using something called bisection search.

            "text": " So the first one related to bisection search is we'll cut the search space in half each iteration. So with my brute force algorithm, we're trimming the search base only a little bit each step. So if we think about it, what it looks like, we had a space of values to search for the answer. And I started here. And each step, I just trimmed off a tiny, tiny little bit, 0.001, leaving me a lot of space to search. And that's why it took so long. When I do bisection search, the basic idea is each step I want to cut the search space in half. Get rid of half of the search space each time. So one way I could do it is I start with a guess say in the middle. Just pick some guess that's in the middle of my search space. And now I say is it too high or too low?",

So if I knew that my guess was too big, then I know there's no point in looking over here for my next guess. So I can get rid of this whole half in one step. Now, what should my next guess be? Yeah?

Clearly, the first value and the last value, but also, how small I'm dividing it up. Right? So I have to think about that too. What is the precision with which I do this. Am I looking at every one millionth of a number or every 0.01? That will tell me how big it is. Once I know how big my search space is, I know that if I search it linearly looking at every value, my worst cases, I look at everything until I get to the end.

But now, I'm going to take a lower bound, here, and an upper bound on my search space. I'm going to say my initial guess will be the upper bound plus the lower bound over 2 halfway through my search space. And then, I'm just going to work my way through it until I get to the answer or don't find it. So should we look at what's going on here? Let's try this. Well, let's first make sure it works for a small value. Never test your program first on something big. Always try your program in something small first.",

But that's OK, because it's still meets the specification. It's still within epsilon of the actual square root. And I didn't have to say that I wanted it below or the square root or above, just said within epsilon. Sure enough, different algorithm, different answer, but equally good, but a lot faster. Now let's try it for the big value. Wow, that was a lot faster, wasn't it? It got me an answer. Probably, not exactly the same answer as before but pretty close. But it did it in only 26 guesses. Pretty cool. And in fact, we'll see over and over again that bisection",

Let's look at the code, and let's think about what was the size of our initial search space. It's a little bit tricky to think about this, right? Now, we have to think a little bit harder about when we exit the loop, because in fundamentally, that's telling me the size of the search space. So what determined the size of the search space? Well, we talked about the upper and the lower bound. But what's telling me roughly speaking how",

And so it's going to be roughly 12345 divided by 0.01 squared, which turns out to be 26.897 more or less. So we could predict it. And son of a gun, when we ran it, we actually matched the prediction. That's the great thing about algorithmic analysis. We can actually get accurate guesses as to how long a program is likely to take to run. This is an important thing because sometimes we do that and we say, oh, it's going to take a year. I better not even try. I better find a smarter algorithm. Or we do it and say, well, it's going to take almost no time at all. I'm not going to waste my time looking for a smarter algorithm. I'm going to live with the one I've got. It's important, and again, as I said, it's a topic we're going to get back to. Of course, whether it's 26, 27, or even 50 doesn't really matter. What matters is it's not a billion. Right? Because we don't really care small differences. Whether it takes 25 or it takes 50 will be an",

Now, I have a question about this program. I've been obsessing about whether it's fast enough. And we've shown it is. But does it work? Kind of more important. It's always possible to write a really fast program that gives you the wrong answer. The problem is to write a fast program that give you the right answer. Does this program always work? Well, it worked for 25. It worked for 12345. Is that good enough? Probably not. We might want to try it in some other values. I'll ask a simpler question. Does it always work on positive values? All right. I'll give you a hint. No. It does not. I'm not going to, however, tell you why it doesn't, because I want you to think about it. And I want you to tell me why it doesn't in the next lecture. But because I'm not a complete sadist, I'll give you a hint. When we use bisection search, or for that matter, any search",

If indeed the answer is out here or out here, then it doesn't matter how carefully I search this region. I'm not going to find the answer. And so this program doesn't work on some potential values of x because the actual square root of x will not lie in the region that the program is searching. I leave it to you to think about what such values are. And we can talk about that on the next lecture. Suppose I want to use this program to find the cube root. Suppose it worked, and I want it to use it to find a cube root. What would I have to change? How would I change it, so it found cube roots instead of square roots? Well, I can take it up. I could use cut and paste, and paste it into my editor and get a new program. And how would I change that new program to make it do cube roots? Not very hard.

All I have to do is change that two to a three and that two to a three, and I'm done. And I should probably change the message to say cube root. Pretty easy. On the other hand, suppose I also want it to find the fourth root, and the fifth root, and the sixth root, however many roots. Well, I'm going to get pretty tired of cutting, and pasting, and building a whole bunch of things. So really, what I want to do is find a way to write the code that will find the nth root of a number for any n. To do that, I'm going to introduce a new programming concept. And that concept is the function. And that will be the main topic of Thursday's lecture.",
