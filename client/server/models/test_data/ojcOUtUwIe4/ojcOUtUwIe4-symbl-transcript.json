                "content": " Today we're coming back to blockchain and money, Act Three of this course. Now that we've done a little of the basics, a little bit of the economics, and now it's some use cases through the lens of finance. And to say something about one, why I thought it'd be worthwhile to structure the course this way, and what I'm hoping we all get out of these next 10 or 11 lectures is that I thought that it was important after laying some foundation of what blockchain technology might or might not be, and cryptocurrencies, and of course, talking about the economics, is to use one field that's the most dominant field right now about potential blockchain technology use, which is finance. It's not the only area, but finance is completely reliant on ledgers. It's completely reliant on moving property rights around multiple parties. And of course, the first use case was about Bitcoin, which was a peer-to-peer money. So I thought even if you're thinking about this in terms of health care, thinking about it terms of the internet of things, et cetera, many, many other use cases, why not take finance. Now it also happens to be my comparative background. And I've spent the last three or four decades of my life around finance. And so I can be most helpful and dig deep, you know, probably as deep as you want to get in the mortgage market, the payment markets, the exchange markets. I've probably been there at some point in my career, or still have contacts and networks and have studied it. But no doubt, with the 80 of you in this room, or 90 or so, you're going to press me. And that I like that. I will say last weekend was really a joy reading 50-plus papers that it was only about 25 of you that had decided to hand in papers early in classes 2 through 9. But class 10 was 50-plus of you. So I really do have a sense of the class in terms of what you think about finance and blockchain. Of course, you'll probably do the same. I think I might design it differently the next time. But if you all hand in-- if 50 or 60 of you hand in the papers for class 23, it will be-- and you have that right. I'm not taking that away from any of you. But it means I might be delayed getting back all the projects. I want to say two or three other things overall. In terms of where we are, we're halfway through the semester. And Sabrina and Thalita and I did a good job of just saying, how are we doing on class participation? And I've kidded a lot, and I've joked a lot about who's talked and so forth. We're down to about 15 of you that have never talked in this whole 12-- so I want to work with you. I'm not trying to torture anybody. And I really want you to all not to worry too much about your grades. I want you to worry a little bit, but not too much about your grades. But if you've not spoken yet, and you haven't gone online-- two people have gone online, both of whom I've responded to. You know, come see me. Try to figure out how to be part of this community and this discussion, whether it's in class or online in some way. Cause again, I want this to be a positive learning experience for everybody. In terms of the papers and just some overall things, by and large they were good. Some were extraordinarily good, which you'd expect with such a talented group of people. But some really made me think and challenged me and so forth. It is a bell-shaped curve. Some, on the other hand-- not many-- kind of missed the mark. So I just want to say a couple of things. One is, it's not about just answering the three study questions. The study questions are really to spur the dialogue here. There's three questions. Not many of you, but two or three people just sort of just tried to answer those. Think about it as a uniform three-page paper. Five is the limit. One or two of you that did six or seven pages. That's fine, but it's just-- you don't need to, and it's more work, in a sense, for us. Two is, I really did try to give feedback and comments. And overall what we're trying to get to is, what are the economics here? What is there about append-only logs and consensus protocols amongst multiple parties writing to a shared ledger? So multiple parties updating some state of economic-- an economic state, really-- of property rights or something. And what verification costs, what networking costs, could be lowered. And it's unfair, because all of you are going to try to figure out a final project together. And I went back over the weekend looking at the final projects. I think there's some really neat ideas that you're looking at. But at the core is what verification costs, what networking costs, can you lower. Why do append-only logs consensus amongst multiple parties sharing a ledger, and possibly a native token. Because you don't have to do something around permissionless native tokens. But I think some of you will get there. And we'll have some exciting thoughts. So those were my thoughts. If I say in the comments to your paper-- and I only did this two or three times-- come see me, don't be scared. It might just be I want to pursue. I said this on some really excellent papers, and I said this on one or two that just I thought it'd be worthwhile to talk about. But I'm trying to just get through this all with you and have you learn. So there's just some overall thoughts on where we are halfway through. Post SIP week. Today we're going to talk about payments. And Thursday we have a guest, Alin. If you want to get mic'd up, I've got a mic up here somewhere for you, cause I'm going to call on you. Or you can speak from there. "

                "content": " Yeah. That's not hard, is it? So what are we going to do? We're going to talk about just what are we trying to cover for the rest of this semester? Sort of call it H2 in blockchain and money. The readings, payment systems, ledgers, and credit cards. Just a little bit of history all together. And that's when you're going to meet Alin. Not computer science Alin, but payment Alin. And we're going to talk about mobile payments, which is a very significant change all the way around the globe in payments. Then global and US payments statistics. Bitcoin and blockchain we're going to come back to. And then conclusion. And remember, whether it's this week, next week, or the following week, this is all just to sort of say, well, wait. What are these use cases tell us about blockchain? What are these use cases tell us about cryptocurrencies? My goal isn't that everybody here is an expert in payment. But if your final project is around the payment space, or if you ultimately want to go along and become an entrepreneur and do something successful in this space, hopefully these two lectures today and Thursday will help. And I can't remember exactly what next week is. Next week's central bank and commercial banking. So next week we're going to turn to central bank digital currency and what's going on in Sweden, and why the e-krona project's interesting, but how's Canada looking at it through their Jasper project? What's China kind of thinking about and why they're a little worried about this space? And yes, what's the private sector doing around stable value tokens? So you have sort of a similar thing coming both from central banks and from the private sector. I just came from a meeting where one of Larry's colleagues-- he's from the Harvard Business School-- a professor at Harvard Business School came over because he's got a stable value token project. And so that's kind of next week. We're then going to go and talk about ICOs. You couldn't do a course in blockchain and money if we didn't talk about initial coin offerings with, of course, $25 or $30 billion that's been raised. It's an enormous crowdfunding opportunity for any of you that want to be venture and entrepreneurial after this course. But it's an important, also, test. Are there attributes of certain economies where native token is appropriate? It will spur as an incentive function. I'm not willing to give up. I know some of you are minimalist. I'm still thinking of the Skins and the gamers. Larry, when you weren't here we identified our most avid gamers in the class. And so we always refer to Skins, Shields, and Swords as a form of native token in the gaming sites. But where there might be economics-- token economics. So we'll sort of turn to that. On the 15th of November we've got a couple of guests in Jeff Sprecher and Kelly Loeffler, who run the Intercontinental Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange and others, but have real live payments and crypto exchange. We're going to turn-- oh-- I'm sorry. I got it out of order. Primary markets, ICOs is before and after Thanksgiving, I guess. And then do a little of the back office side. The back of a side is clearing and settlement. I mean, why is the Australian stock exchange using a permissioned system? Might you use something else? Why is the international swap and dealer association using smart contracts now to try to rationalize a lot of their payment flows? So we'll get to real live use cases that are happening around smart contracts and permissioned clearing systems. A little bit of trade finance, digital ID. I know at least one group is doing some-- one of the groups here is doing something on digital ID. So you'll be out ahead of us. So that's kind of a review of H2 for us. So we had a bunch of readings. Some of them were quite short. I don't know, because you're on sip week, whether you were able to go through them. But maybe I should just ask, does anybody want to tell me about some of the major trends in payments? I don't know how sleepy everybody is or whether-- Priya, I saw your hand, or you were scratching your nose. "

[APPLAUSE] So Alin , he heads part of the digital currency initiative here at MIT in the Media Lab. All the efforts around lightning network and layer two solutions. But before MIT, he was a vice president of First Data. And First Data is a payment system provider. And he had about 200 people reporting to him and a big business-- $200 million P&L. That's revenues, right? Yeah. I mean, if it was profits, even better for you. And then he spent three years in a startup world. So he's somebody if you're interested in blockchain and digital currency initiative, you should get to know anyway. But if you're even interested in startups outside of payment world, Alin's great. And he's going to be here today and Thursday. And not only when I make mistakes, but a couple of times I'm going to get you up here to say stuff about how payments really works. But he's like, way embedded in the MIT blockchain community. So payment systems. Again, what is a payment system? It is moving money, of course. But on some level it is a way to amend and record entries on ledgers. Because a ledger is how we keep money now. Certainly in the digital world it's always recorded on some ledger somewhere. So there is an authorization phase. There's a clearing phase, and then final settlement. Does anybody want to take a crack other than Alin as to what it means to authorize a payment? Just to authorize a payment. It might not have been in the readings, but it's sort of just use your language skills to tell me what it might mean to authorize a payment. Tom.

Right. Is the money there? I'm [INAUDIBLE] authorize. Right? I'm gonna get an answer right back, saying, yep. The money's there. OK. I just authorized it. But it's a very simple, like, ping right back and forth. Right? So it needs to be a very small transaction. From there on you can start to say, OK. Now let's batch transactions and do the clearing. And then from there on you actually send on the money. Right? The interesting part about all of this is that it evolved in time. So this technology, if you were to do it now with all of the tools that are at our disposal now, you'd do it differently, entirely. However, payments, as Gary will point out in the next couple of slides, basically evolved organically through decades. And you know, they started with [INAUDIBLE].. "

But that is a payment instruction from one Thomas Jefferson account to another Thomas Jefferson account. But it's a payment instruction. It didn't actually move the money. It's just a payment instruction. This is a Western Union Telegram. The telegraph came along in the 1840's, if I remember. But Western Union took several decades to come along and say, we can send instructions to move value using the telegraph. And the Telex machine, which was post-world War II-- and yes, I'm old enough to say that there were still telex machines at Goldman Sachs when I started in 1979 that you would type in to type in an instruction. So Alin, you're asking where did it come from. It came from technology move from first authorizing. Does that party have the legal rights to move something, move value? Do they have enough of the value? Is there enough in their account? And so forth. That's the authorization phase. Now you'd say, well, can't that all be done simultaneously? And the answer is, yes. Maybe. But most of the payments system is still based on authorization, clearing, and then settlement. Financial ledgers that are also the reason. Ledgers record economic activity. We've talked about this earlier in the semester. They record transactions or accounts. Bitcoin is a transaction ledger. Ethereum and others are account ledgers. But they're both ledgers. They're both forms of recording something that has a right. The data is usually used around some right or a token. But the first ledgers were thousands of years ago. And I think on those ledgers, I don't know how they split authorization, clearing, and settling. But they were a form of a ledger. I like presidents, I like American history. So I pulled-- George Washington used to use a personal ledger, single entry ledger. But the IBM 360 came along in the early 1960s. And it revolutionized the world of finance and ledgers. It still took about 14 years. I think it was in the early 1970s after big paperwork crash on Wall Street, meaning literal, physical pieces of paper were moving around the late 1960s. And they had to shut the New York Stock Exchange down, I think, for a day or two, because they'd gotten weeks or months behind in clearing the paper. They had passed authorization. It was all in clearing securities trends, and was created by an act of Congress that there would be central clearing and settling. And DTCC was in essence created to solve and get out of that huge mess and a problem. But it was on the backs of technology that it could even be done, that there would be a central ledger.

But once you get into the 20th century, it starts to be more or more digitized, even early 20th century, commerce-- big commerce-- was starting to be in the banking system. But in the last 50 years, and certainly the last 20 years, we're almost fully digitized in developed countries, not middle economic countries. But that's correct. But this still ties back to a ledger. I'll get that back later. Credit cards. The first big write-up of credit cards was a book from the 1880s that said, what would the world be like in the year 2000? And 15 or 20 times in the book it used the word \"credit card.\" They fictionalized the future of credit cards. I haven't read the book, but I just love that it was written in the 1880s. But the actual start of the use of credit tokens, if not credit cards, started actually in the late 19th century. And the idea is that you could have a token that was for as particular merchant. And by the 1920s you had them for getting your gasoline when automobiles started to be popular, and so forth. But they were not generalized credit tokens. They were a credit token really by one merchant. So think of them as a merchant-specific token. In the 1940s in Brooklyn, New York, somebody-- in essence the innovation was to have a more generalized token that could give you credit at more than one merchant. And once that happened, of course, credit cards took off. First in the US, Diner's Card. American Express was in the mid '50s. And then Bank of America figured out, maybe we will even extend credit multiple banks. And they created a network. Bank of America was a California bank. It's not the bank you think of now. In those days it was California based. But maybe we can have a network across the whole US. And that network is actually the network that became Visa. It was a shared ownership service amongst a bunch of banks across. But the cards had to be processed. Does anybody even ever see the processing that's in the left, in the middle, any longer in the US and Europe? No, you probably-- "

And part of the answer, Alin, too is why you need authorization, clearing, and settlement is there's a lot of steps in this, in the traditional movement of money. And this is just domestic. You can add digital wallets, and you could add Bitcoin. And the question is, does cryptocurrency skip all this stuff in the middle? And can digital wallets jump start over some of these? And the answer is, digital wallets need to do all these things if they're going to jump. They have to store the value; they have to do some authorization; the equivalent of clearing, if there's any clearing; and then move it, which is settlement. So these are the fees. You want to-- "

And I think that-- it shows, right? This entire value chain, which we're going to go through right afterwards, basically relies on consumer using this process to pay a recipient. It can be a merchant or another person. Right? Merchants like the fact that they get value. They don't have the type that have to pay a lot of money. So there's an inner intention there. And that intention manifests itself in a number of ways. But it's important. Right. So just the dynamics are [INAUDIBLE] to where this black box out here getting money over here automatically have kind of a [INAUDIBLE] way to the banks for the merchants. Right? The interesting piece here is that this access method is probably the most underrated aspect of this entire bank chain. If you think of anytime you go up to a merchant or to a website or whatever, whoever manages that access point is probably the most important thing. You may have the best solution out there. If you're not in that access method, might as well not have it. And that, I think, is something to import. Cause as you're going to go through [INAUDIBLE] where does value accumulate in this value chain, what you're going to see is more often than not [INAUDIBLE] methods aren't going to [INAUDIBLE] point to actually any meaningful change. Because those are hard changes, right? For a large merchant, changing anything at access point, it's hard. So that's something to keep in mind. Right? The other thing I would say is one of the things where we talked about how exactly to get big change at scale, and you have to have two things. You have to have technology, which is this is OK. It's not great. Right? This is kind of old. It used to be really great about two or three decades ago, but this is not [INAUDIBLE]. But this is an unbelievable business model. And if you look at the way the business model operates, consumer love it. Consumers love it. So consumer gets-- I can pay wherever. It's great. Right? Banks love it. You know, they make a lot of money out of it. They get what's called [INAUDIBLE].. All these other vendors out here exist because of it. Merchants, I would say are kind of neutral to it. They dislike many aspects of it, but then processing cash is also expensive. Right? So if you're trying to understand where do I want to change things here? A lot of the folks in the actual payment space will tell you, well, payments is kind of-- you know-- it kind of works. Right? It really doesn't work if you're on the fringes. But if you're in the middle, it kind of works. It's a pretty good system. And the beauty of the existing model we have right now is actually the business model on the way it works. So I'll pause right there [INAUDIBLE].. "

And that's why Alin focused on the access points. If you're going to disrupt this, you've got to figure out some way to get adoption-- broad adoption-- on the merchant class. The money. This was from the Bloomberg article, the Bloomberg article that was reviewing China. $2.75 in the US on average comes out of every $100 purchase. And by the way, if you make $1,000 purchase, it's $27. And I used to think when I was on the CFO of the Hillary campaign, if somebody was generous enough to give us $2,700, which was the legal limit to a political candidate during that cycle, we were paying 70 US dollars to this, to that, to help elect a president. Or in a billion dollar campaign, 2.7% is $27 million. Now I'm not saying we spent $27 million on this, because we were able to encourage some donors to give us checks. But I will tell you, even being recorded, in the modern economy it's hard to convince somebody to give you a check, even somebody who is generously giving their support to a political candidate to win the presidency. And you say, well, we actually get $70 more if you give us a check. Yeah, but I got my credit card here. So, yes. "

There were some donors that said, well, I'm using my American Express card. I'm getting my points back. And if they gave $1,000-- not a million-- you know, that they would maybe get the equivalent of $10 of points back. That is correct. So merchants aren't enthusiastic about this split. This is the US model. It does not cost this much in India. It does not cost this much in China. So in many other countries the jump started around the credit card payment systems. It costs a lot less. But in the US, our payment system is significantly built on credit card rails-- rails like tracks-- it's called. So cross-border. I'm not going to go through these two charts.

I mean, many Americans don't. But many Americans do. So it's this bundling of payment and credit services. And you're absolutely right, because when the internet came along in our country, we had established credit card payment rails. And most of the internet payments, whether it was for your mortgage-- well, usually not mortgage, but whether it was for your utilities or your small dollar payments were built on top of the credit card rails. Your mortgage-- most mortgage lenders would say, no. I don't want to pay the 2.7%. We didn't have enough market power even as a political campaign to get people to give it to us in checks, or to Zelle payment to us. But this 2.7 is economic rents. This is a form of economic rents. Fraud. Does anybody know the figures for frauds in this country? I went and looked at it in the last two days. So it was not in the readings. Total fraud is about 10 to 20 basis points. So of this 270 basis points-- or 2.7%-- less than 10% of it's really going to pay for fraud. Now fraud is a really big thing, don't get me wrong. But it's a small portion of this.

It's this, which is not solely for the payment, but I'm saying this is largely for using the credit card rails as a payment rail. And then you charge an interest rate spread, which is over 1,000 basis points, usually. The spread versus underlying bank borrowing tends to be anywhere from 1,000 to 1,800 basis points on some of these. But I'm not saying it's separate. It's two business models. Let me churn on. "

And there was a Federal Reserve rule making on that. Debit card numbers came down significantly from this. I just don't know the exact figures. But it's over 100 basis points still on debit cards. But it's not 270. Good question. So I'm not going to go through the details. But cross-border payments have more complexity. I'm not going to go through, but the paym-- this is the what I'll call the front end. You have a payer on the left and a payee on the right. Think of somebody in the US sending money to somebody in the Philippines, maybe. I need on my side a payment system processor. That's the bubble on the top. I need them to have some payment system processor. They're both ends on the front end. So just think more complexity, more friction in the system. And really the reason is, is because you're jumping from one money to another money. Or another way you can think of it as you're usually jumping from one ledger system to another ledger system, if you're thinking like the computers and recording. And the back end-- I should have called this back end, but I labeled both of them front end, sorry-- has a bunch of things inside of it. And the one I'm just going to mention is correspondent banking. It is a feature that came out of centuries of banking. Arguably, you might not need it as much now. But the concept was, I'm a small regional bank in the US. I'm sending something to somebody in the Philippines. The Philippines doesn't recognize this small regional bank, let's say, in Kansas. I need a correspondent bank that they can trust. So it's a cost of trust that it could go from one country's bank through a bank called a correspondent bank, which had trust, to the other country's bank. Or maybe you even had correspondent banks in both countries. But usually you had one international bank in between. Hugo. "

And what was the other country? The Philippines. Which is a peso? What's that? Peso. Yeah. So US dollar fiat to crypto Bitcoin to Philippine peso. That is called a bridge crypto or bridge currency. That's, in fact, what Ripple is trying to do with XRP. So Ripple is a company that started as a payment messaging service to compete with Swift. And that messaging service, which we'll talk about more Thursday, has been adopted by many banks. More recently in 2018 they rolled out a prototype of using a crypto token-- XRP-- as a bridge currency. I would say yes, that is possible. I think there's an issue also about volatility. So if you're moving fiat dollar to crypto Bitcoin XRP to fiat, if you have a lot of volatility, that means it's a less-- it could be costly. But if it's stable value, so you can you can lower the cost two ways-- lowering the volatility of the crypto or lower the time. And XRP believes they have a solution that can be down to seconds. And thus, even if it's volatility, that in seconds it won't move as much. And the friction will be that you have to sell dollars to buy XRP, and then sell XRP to buy peso. Or you can interpose any bridge currency. One of the most significant opportunities for stable value tokens that we'll talk about in a few classes is maybe is what we can call it is a bridge currency for cross-border. "

But again, if it's only on $50 to $200 US dollar sort of transactions, you'd have to figure out how to get your cost structure down there. Or is it for the multi-million dollar treasury function, for the Fortune 500 or the World 1,000 or whatever treasury function, where they're really talking about frictions which are in basis points. But still, the bridge currency-- crypto bridge currencies-- might still help in the treasury function side-- I'll call the corporate treasury function side all the way to the retail remittance side. The percentage fees are different. And you just have to be able to say, well, can I get inside of those inefficiencies. And on the retail side it takes two to five days to do a remittance.

But until it grows larger it's not a medium of exchange in any economy-wide solution. So this is a slide you've seen before. We're not going to spend much time. But in payments some of these matter and some don't. And I think if I did my little thing-- some will grow. All right. Yeah. There you go. All the illicit activity. Remember in public policy there's something called the Bank Secrecy Act. If you're thinking about anything in the payment space, you're probably moving something of value. And in almost every country you have to comply with some form of anti-money laundering, know your customer, Bank Secrecy type of thing. The US Department Treasury said so in 2013. You probably also have to deal with some consumer protection. That's why that box on the bottom sort of grew. Like, you're just not going to lose their money or steal their money. And maybe something about privacy, whether it's GDPR type of privacy in Europe or elsewhere. You're not worried about investor protection. But in this country, you have to worry about how to register as a money service provider. And other countries similarly register. So I just raise that. And as we go through use cases in H2, I'm going to constantly kind of use this start and say, well, what public policy issues? You don't have to worry about the SEC, probably. But maybe some stable value token might be an exchange traded fund. So it's possible you might be blurring up against that regulatory state. So technology is affecting us. And this is a slide I think I've used before with everybody. But I thought, well, wait a minute. What of these eight-- and there's more technology affecting finance-- but what are these main eight are really hitting payments, when I add payments. Well, I'd say there's kind of four or five of them. Blockchain is affecting payments. But biometrics, we talked about that earlier. Biometrics, definitely. Mobile telephony, open API, which is the UK initiative where they're saying that UK banks must allow merchants an ability to get inside of those bank accounts, basically. It's called open API, because they have an interface directly into the bank accounts. And even robotic scraping of data-- RPA. I think they're all related to payments in some way. Or maybe everything. Maybe cloud and AI and machine learning. But I kind of think-- I think that these five are the ones. So blockchain is amongst the things changing payment. It's not the only thing changing payments. And then remember a bunch of attempts in the '90s? A bunch of ways to do digital cash in the '90s? We talked about this in the first or section lecture of the course. Fundamentally, why did they all fail? Anybody remember why they failed? "

And eventually, you know, they were saving very little money. But they were saving. And they didn't have a way to then move into the formal economy. You know, so the money just stayed there. And it literally was money stored in a box with three locks, and they were-- And you know, it was a way that even without literacy you could do it. At that time, DFID, the British overseas development agency, was sponsoring a few of these NGOs to do this work. And the consortium's biggest problem was, now how did we-- the next step up is to transition them into the formal economy and gain access to credit. It was like the opposite approach of the micro [INAUDIBLE]. And that's the point when in Kenya this breakthrough happened is when these savings groups finally had some money. And the first thing that happened at their villages-- like, no bank was going to open a branch. There was a movement around mobile branches. But even that was very expensive for the amount of money that each of these scripts was saving. And so then these first operators came up. It was almost like an act of frustration, you know. Like, OK. We have this cash in this box that cannot be stored. So now we're just going to move. "

                "content": " So let me capture it. So some of the themes is that where there is a market gap, there is a gap in Kenya with unbanked. And by the way, half of sub-Saharan Africa is still unbanked. But half of that unbanked have mobile phones. But there is a gap in China. And so Alipay and WeChat and so forth started to fill it. What gaps are there today that you all can fill. And then secondly, does a blockchain technology solution help fill that gap? There might be big gaps created by 275 basis points in the US, the 2 and 3/4 percent using the credit card rails for payments. There might be gaps of the unbanked. There might be big gaps in customer user interface, because a lot of the customer user interface in current banking isn't that great as we move to mobile phones. QR codes. There was a nice comment-- see, if you do comment, I remember what you say online. But there was a nice comment about QR codes. Where are QR codes used in payment most dominantly? Two countries. What? China and India. The US, and I would even contend Europe, are no longer at the forefront of payments. Because we're sort of had existing big legacy systems. But that might mean that there is big legacy systems built on the credit card rails dominantly, might be vulnerable. A quick thing just on the methods. This was out of a report you had, but I just thought in 2016, 29% stole credit card. Estimate, five years from now worldwide down to 15%. eWallet is 18% to 46%. Those trends, if they're right, and of course, they won't be exactly right, but those trends creates opportunity. When you have huge changes, and people are changing the way they're doing things, that's usually where business opportunities are. You had-- this is too detailed. But I think it's sort of fascinating that the Federal Reserve puts this out once a year. It's always old, stale data. But the big things I took away is that we've got a huge change that's happening here even in the US. And card payments still growing, of course. But not like they once were. Mobile payments are big changing. Half of all card payments are done online, by the way, not in person now. So those statistics, if you're going to build a real business and not just a business for a final project for Gensler's course, you're going to want to dive into these statistics. You want to see where are the opportunities. What are the trends in the statistics. And then Bitcoin came along. And we're not going to chat more, but I'm going to just say, just as the two minutes left, don't forget the economics. And I say this again coming back to having read 50 papers over the weekend. When you're writing for the rest of the semester, whatever section-- whether you write on payments, whether you write on central bank, whatever you write one, remember about thinking about what are the benefits of block J. What are the real specifics? And particularly, how does it lower verification or networking costs? Like Christian Catalini wrote about, but just we talked about it. Coming to my office. Ask for office hours. Say, wait a minute. How does-- does it really need to happen this way? And most importantly, what are the net benefits? And I keep coming to my friend Brotish. No, don't do a traditional database. You gotta get to a private blockchain. This is not a traditional database course. We're about permission blockchains or permissionless blockchain. And remember, blockchains are about append-only logs with some consensus with multiple parties having the right to change the state of the ledger. So it's sort of like, when does that valuable? I believe there is value to that. But not in every circumstance. And certainly if there is a native token, why do you need a native token? Is it there to jump start a network? Is it to help with token economics? Remembering that there is great network effects to having one currency per jurisdiction. But let's not forget that certain multi-jurisdiction currencies have failed. The history of multi-jurisdiction currencies is they almost always fail. We still have not seen the end or what's going to happen with the URL. I mean, decades from now, I'm saying. And don't forget the skins and the swords as well. So we're back together again on Thursday. We're going to do payments on that day. We're going to dive more into payments-- actual blockchain technology stuff and payments. Thank you, Alin.
