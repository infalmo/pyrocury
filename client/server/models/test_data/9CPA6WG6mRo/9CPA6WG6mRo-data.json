Everyone I trust can hear me adequately. Welcome back. It's Tuesday. For those of you who are not in my recitation section, I'm Dave Gossard, and I'll be your lecturer for the day. Professor Vandiver is out of town. It looks like some of you may be as well. We probably could have held this at the gate at Logan Airport and done a little better. But be that as it may, glad you came. This should be fun. Today we have a new topic and a demonstration, a real physical system. So unless there are any outstanding questions? Anybody have any questions or complaints to address to Vicente? No. All right, hearing none let's go ahead and get started then. Today the topic is multiple degree of freedom systems.",

You know the concept of equations of motion, or I should say the equation of motion and the notion of undamped natural frequency. Well, today we're going to generalize, if you will, to systems that have not one but multiple degrees of freedom and see how those notions generalize. In particular, as you might expect, the system that has multiple degrees of freedom has multiple natural frequencies, also known as eigenvalues as we will explain here shortly. Multiple degrees of freedom systems have a new property, a new characteristic you haven't seen before. And that's what this lecture is all about, is to illustrate that to you and demonstrate it. It's the notion of natural modes, also called eigenvectors.",

And the displacements are indicated as shown there, X1 and X2. I want to hasten to point out that the displacements we speak of here are defined with respect to the static equilibrium position. This is a notion that Professor Vandiver went over at least once.

            "text": " But assuming you agree, let me simply say you've got two springs, two masses. The typical way we've taught you to do it is if you're going to generate the equations of motion by the direct method, you generate two free body diagrams, the sum forces in the x direction for each of the masses, get f equals MA and you'd get these. Conversely, you could also do it by Legrange. You could generate the expression for the kinetic energy, for the potential energy, for the Legrangian, do this Lagrange equation business, and you'd get the same thing. But either way you do it, what comes out the other side looks like this. And it's not a bad exercise for you to offline convince yourself that this is right. Not right now, but in the comfort and leisure of another time. So there you have it.",

This is simply a restructuring, and reorganization of these equations. And this may seem foreign to those of you who have not had any or very much linear algebra. Do not be dismayed. It is not a difficult thing to learn. As you probably know, a matrix multiplies by a vector-- or multiplying a vector by a matrix-- is done with two hands. The first item for example is M1 X1 dot plus 0. That gives you this term right here. Over here you get X1 times K1 plus K2. That's this one. And here you have minus K2 X2, that's that term. So matrix notation, this becomes that. No problem.",

There are two of them, and they're right there. Now we're after these guys. Now we're after the relative magnitudes or the relative amplitudes of A1 and A2. And we from one of the equations isolated one of those. And let me just say, if you plug these back in, plug in the first one, you'll get oddly enough 1.618,",

So while we're at it-- Sara, want to hazard a guess? How many natural mode do you think we've got? Yeah, exactly. So you're going to have one of these for each degree of freedom. Let me just point out a couple of elements here, and then I'll show you a demonstration because we have to have some fun today. These are point of informations. They're ratios, not absolute magnitudes. That's number one. The second is-- I already told you, they got the same number. OK, each natural mode is associated with a particular natural frequency.",

All right. Now is the time. Could I bring up the side board here? Let me show you-- anybody here taken 2086? Wonderful. I've got one person? Great. Anyway, I believe in 2086, don't they teach you MATLAB? Isn't that the weapon of choice? OK, that's the program I'm using here, MATLAB. For those of you who haven't seen it yet, it is definitely a mixed bag. I don't know how you feel about it. It's very-- yeah-- it's very powerful. It stands for Matrix Laboratory.

PROFESSOR: I'm sorry? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: Yes. Well, I believe I can-- here we go, fonts. Upping the fonts is kind of a mixed bag, because you get bigger letters but they're. OK, how's that? So here's the situation. This is a MATLAB program. And I'll explain to you what it does as we go. Let me see if my little cursor-- my cursor's here, but I can't see it. All right, here's the system parameters. Once again, we're doing a simple spring mass-- this simplified spring mass system, exactly the one we've done here.

And we've got 10 newtons per meter on each of the springs. Everybody appreciate that this system's numbers that we're putting in here match our case here, K over M? OK. And you can see here, we've defined-- and again, let me just say I'm not trying to sell you on MATLAB. I don't want to leave you with the impression that we expect you to be able to instantly become a user of MATLAB. This is simply to illustrate the point of the lecture here. Here is the M, the system matrix. There's the K matrix. And I'll show you the eigenvalue and eigenvector thing later. But let me-- take my word for it. See this here? Ode45 is a cryptic allusion to the Runge-Kutta algorithm, fourth order Runge-Kutta that is the workhorse for integrating differential equations. And so let me just run this. And what I've got here is, here's the point I wanted you to get here, because I'll bet you can't see that cursor either. Yes, anyway, see this right here?",

What I've done is I've displaced the two masses. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: They'll certainly have an amplitude, because I'm putting it in there. That's the initial condition. The question is, what frequency you think they'll oscillate at? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Pardon?

Let me blow it up so you can see it. Ooh, isn't that pretty? And I believe the blue is X1 and the green is X2. See? Everybody agree? Everyone appreciate what's going on? You pull them both at slightly different-- you basically used the first natural mode as the initial condition. And sure enough, they oscillate together. They oscillate at the same frequency. They oscillate at that frequency. Let me just see-- I just want to make sure we get the full value out of this thing. Well, of course you can't see it anymore because our numbers are so big. Well, that's great. Anyway, take my word for it at-- oh, here it is. The period for the first natural frequency-- or I guess it's the second-- it should be like 1.2.",

They're both oscillating at the same natural frequency, going up and down together. But they have different amplitudes. So one's bigger than the other. So that's what it looks like. Questions?

Is that good, bad, indifferent? Is it right? Wrong? AUDIENCE: The way the system acts, it has a higher frequency. PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly. Two things. One is, they're out of phase. They're doing this. One's going this way, and the other's going the other at different amplitudes but the same frequency. But the frequency in question is higher than the previous.

First I have to find my finger. There it goes. That's the previous case. When they're out of phase, different magnitudes, going in opposite directions. And you can see, they're going at a higher frequency than before. Make sense? So now we are-- just to refresh your memory-- now we're going for the third case, in which there's nothing special. We just picked a couple of initial conditions out of a hat. And here we go. Oops, I think not. I think that's the previous case. So let's go here. This is another wonderful thing about MATLAB is nothing happens until you save it. So we were just running the previous case. Nasty. Look at this.",

It's this expression for just some arbitrary initial condition. Do you see that that behavior though? Each of them, they're going together kind of, but they-- anyway, watch this. Here's what the simulation of that looks like. What the heck is that? Well anyway, the point of the story is that multiple degrees of freedom system in general's response can be arbitrarily complicated. It's not arbitrarily complicated, but pretty complicated. You'll get, in general if it's an nth order system, if you don't know anything about the worst case, you'll see four frequencies in there. And they're all mixed together in some mystical way that's unknown to you. Fair enough? And it's only when you reach the natural modes that you actually find out what is going on here.

I want to demonstrate exactly the same thing for this guy, only this is a real system. Very nice. We have a steel rod. It must be a half inch in diameter. The whole thing weighs several pounds. These sliding masses are right circular cylinders with a hole drilled through them. It's ever so slightly larger than these here. They're of different lengths. They're made of brass. They're serious masses. And the springs, which extend from here to here, and from here to here are wound on a lathe, and attached, and so forth. Pretty, no? Now look right off the bat. Did you see how that thing operates? Would you agree you have some complicated behavior here?",

In what way is it similar to that? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Well, what is clear is that you've got two springs and you've got two masses. About that there is very little argument. AUDIENCE: It's damped. PROFESSOR: It's damped. Can everybody see that? How does [INAUDIBLE] know that it's damped? How's he know it's damped? I mean, that's just a wild guess on his part, but. AUDIENCE: You can hear it, and it slows down. And it slows down. This is the most important part is that it stops. Eventually if you come back in a minute or two, it's done. PROFESSOR: All right, [INAUDIBLE]. You're on a roll. There's definitely damping there. What kind of damping? AUDIENCE: Friction. PROFESSOR: Friction, yeah. Does that have another name that you can think of? It's definitely friction. What it's not is viscous friction. What it is not is a damper or a dashpot which we've shown you",

Here's what I want to do. We just blew out some wonderful theory. All this is just solid as a rock. Yes, sir. AUDIENCE: For the Coulomb friction, is that a linear [INAUDIBLE]? Or is it still exponential? PROFESSOR: I'm sorry? Oh, no. If I'm not mistaken, I didn't really look this up, but I believe it's linear. I'd have to-- take that with a grain of salt, but I believe it's linear. Yes, Amy, here's the situation. We have all this marvelous theory. My goal is to-- and we have this fabulous demo apparatus, though inherited. And what I'd like to do-- oh, and we have computational means to. And in fact, we just went through the exercise.

It's not moving, which means that you know that the force going upwards-- which is the spring-- is equal to the force going downward, which is [INAUDIBLE]. So you can measure the displacement from the start of the spring to the bottom of the spring. Do you know the natural length of the spring? PROFESSOR: No Anyway, what I was going to say is, excellent idea. Can't do it. But what Amy was basically saying is, you know the masses now. Why not simply take from that expression right there, MH over K, right? What's the problem with that? How about it? Devin, how come I can't do that? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

PROFESSOR: Exactly. So Nick, you brought it up. What's that number? You don't know that either. No. Like I said, Amy, nice idea. No cigar. What else? We're running out of time? Here we go, Douglas. AUDIENCE: Could you displace each mast a certain [INAUDIBLE], and then measure the time it takes for them to stop and get the damping ratio? PROFESSOR: Hit the damping ratio. Well, I'll tell you what-- you want to say that again? He said displace one or both count oscillations and get the damping ratio. Nick? AUDIENCE: Do we have anything like a force gauge or a spring scale? PROFESSOR: No. This is my living room I'm talking-- or my study. Anyway, Douglas said-- I forgot what you said now. He said-- oh, I know. You said, displace it and count the oscillations. Get the damping ratio. First off, the damping ratio is no help, even if we did get it.

Yeah, Douglas? AUDIENCE: So how come it gives you just the natural frequency and a damp natural frequency? PROFESSOR: Oh no. It absolutely is. It's all damped, no question about it. But again, what we're doing is we're going close enough, right? Because I have nothing. So even the damped natural frequency is better than nothing. All right, so Amy back to you. You're back in business. What now? So now we've got M2 and K2. AUDIENCE: You just need K1. PROFESSOR: Yeah. Now we need K1. What do we do now? AUDIENCE: We want to do the same thing that we just did for K2. [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: Exactly. Well, not quite. Let's see, now I'm going to turn loose-- now we're back to our original system.

AUDIENCE: So just fix the second mass. PROFESSOR: Fix the second mass. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Yeah, you see this frequency here? I'm going to overrule Chandler. I'm going to say, this is the natural frequency of that's mass and these two springs. Do that same trick again. You get the equivalent spring rate, subtract the second from it, and you get the other one. Devin, is that what you were going to say? Wonderful. That is exactly what I did. And you get out of it, you get K1 is equal to 50.45 newton per meter. In the interest of time, I'm going to short circuit this. I took exactly these parameters, I put them into that same computer program we had before, and what came out-- I have to have a place to put it.",

And this is a little more complicated, because the other one has to be done from the bottom. Hang on a second. Now this one we're doing is we're deflecting-- this one is positive downward. So X1 is down, but X2 is negative. So it's displaced upward a bit. Are you ready? Nick, what do you expect to see this time? AUDIENCE: The frequency should be higher and they'll move in opposite directions. PROFESSOR: That's the key. Once again, they're going to move with the same frequency, albeit in different directions. But that new frequency is going to be higher than before. And sure enough, stand back. So there you go. What did that tell us? That told us that the first order we got the system parameters identified correctly",
