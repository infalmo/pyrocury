PROFESSOR: So really, what my main concern has been for quite a few years is to make some theory of what makes people able to solve so many kinds of problems.

So there are all sorts of things that evolution manages to produce. But maybe the most impressive one is what the human infant can do just by hanging around for 10, or 20, or 30",

So we can solve all sorts of problems, and my quarrel with most of the artificial intelligence community has been that the great success of science in the last 500 years really has been in physics. And it's been rewarded by finding little sets of rules, like Newton's three laws, and Maxwell's four laws, and Einstein's one law or two, that explained a huge range of everyday phenomena. Of course, in the 1920s and '30s, that apple cart got upset. Actually, Einstein himself, who had discovered the first quantum phenomena, namely the quantization of photons, had produced various scientific laboratory observations that were inexplicable in terms of either Maxwell,",

So my picture of the history is that in the 19th century and a little bit earlier going back to Lock, and Spinoza, and Hume, and a few of those philosophers, even Immanuel Kant, they had some pretty good psychological ideas. And as I mentioned the other day, I suspect that Aristotle was more like a modern cognitive psychologist and had even better ideas. But we've probably lost a lot of them, because there are no tape recorders. Who knows what Aristotle and Plato said that their students didn't write down? Because it sounded silly. The idea that we developed around here, mostly, Seymour Papert, and a lot of students-- Pat Winston was one of the great stars of that period. --was the idea that to get anything like human intellectual abilities, you're going to have to have all sorts of high level representations.",

The stimulus has to be represented by some kind of semantic structure somewhere in the brain or mind. So far as I know, it's only in the theories of not even modern artificial intelligence, but the AI of the '60s, and '70s, and '80s, that people thought about what could be the internal representation of the kinds of things that we think about. And even more important, if one of those representations, you see something, or you remember some incident. And your brain represents it in some way. And if that way doesn't work, you take a breath. And you sort of stumble around and find another way to represent it. Maybe when the original event first happened, you represented it in three or four ways. So we're beginning to see-- did anybody hear Ferucci's talk? The Watson guy was up here a couple of days ago. I missed it, but they haven't made a technical publication",

But it sounds like it's something of a interesting society of mind like structure, and it'd be nice if they would-- has anybody read any long paper on it? There have been a lot of press reports. Have you seen anything, Pat? Anyway, they seem to have done some sorts of commonsense reasoning. As I said the other day, I doubt that Watson could understand why you can pull something with a string, but you can't push. Actually, I don't know if any existing program can understand that yet. I saw some amazing demonstrations Monday by Steve Wolfram of his Wolfram Alpha, which doesn't do much common sense reasoning. But what it does do is, if you put in a sentence, it finds five or 10 different representations, anything you can find that's sort of mathematical. So when you ask a question, it gives you 10 answers, and it's much better than previous systems.",

And if you take some particular problem, like I find these days, I can't get the top off bottles. So how do I solve that? And there are lots of answers. One is you look for somebody who looks really strong. Or you reach into your pocket, and you probably have one of these and so on. There must be some way to put it on the floor, and step on it, and kick it with the other foot. So there are lots of problems that we're facing every day. And if you look in traditional cognitive psychology-- well, what's the worst theory? The worst and the best theory got popular in the 1980s, and it was called rule based systems. And you just have a big library, which says, if you have a soda bottle and you can't get the cap off, then do this, or that, or the other. So some people decided, well, that's really all you need.",

Why not just say for each situation in the outer world have a rules that says how to deal with that situation? Let's make a hierarchy of them, and he described a system that sort of looked like the priority interrupt system in a computer. And he won all sorts of prizes for this really bad idea that spread around the world, but it solved a lot of problems. There are things about priority interrupt that aren't obvious, like suppose you have-- in the first computers, there was some problem. Because what should you do, if there's several signals coming into the computer, and you want to respond to them? And some of the signals are very fast and very short. Then you might think, well, I should give the highest priority to the signal that's going to be there the shortest time or something like that. The funny part is that when you made such a system, the result was that, if you had a computer that was responding to some signal that's coming in at a--",

God, that's slow, a million times shorter than what you have in your pocket. And if you give priority to the signals that have to be reacted to very fast, then what happens if you type to those computers? It would never see them, because it's always-- I saw this happening once. And finally, somebody realized that you should give the highest priority to the inputs that come in least frequently, because there's always-- otherwise, if there's something coming in very frequently, you'll just always be responding to it. Any of you run into this? It took me a while to figure out why. Anyway, there are lots of kinds of problems. And the other day, I was complaining that we didn't have enough ways to do this. We had hundreds of words for emotions, and here's a couple of dozen. They're in chapter seven and eight actually most of these. So here's a bunch of words for describing ways to think,",

Hundreds and hundreds of words for feelings, and it's a lot of effort to find a dozen words for intellectual, for-- what should I call them? --problem solving processes. So it's curious to me that the great field called cognitive psychology has not focused in that direction. Anyway, here's about 20 or 30 of them. And you'll find them scattered through chapters seven and eight. Here's my favorite one, and I don't know of any proper name for it. But if you're trying to solve a problem, and you're stuck, and the example that comes to my mind is, if I'm trying to remember someone's name, I can tell when it's hopeless. And the reason is that for somehow or other, I know that there's a huge tree of choices. That's one way to represent what's going on, and I might know that-- I'm sure that name has a Z in it. So you search around and try everything you can.",

And you have no idea how it happened and so forth. Anyway, the long story is that Papert, and I, and lots of really great students in the '60s and '70s spent a lot of time making little bottles of problem solvers that didn't work.

And my conclusion is that, wow, it's the opposite of physics. In physics, you're always trying to find-- what is it called? --Occam's razor. Never have more structure than you need, because what?

And people ask, what's the difference between self models and self-conscious processes? And I don't care. Well, what's the difference between self-conscious and reflective? I don't care. And the reason is that, wow, it's nice to have a box that isn't full yet. So if you find something that your previous theory-- going back to Brooks, he was so successful getting simple robots to work that he concluded that the things didn't need any internal representations at all. And for some mysterious reason, the Artificial Intelligence Society gave him their annual big prize for this very wrong idea, and it caused AI research to sort of half collapse in places, like Japan. He said, oh, rule based systems is all we need. Anybody want to defend him? The odd thing is, if you talk to Brooks, he's one of the best philosophers you'll ever meet. And he says, oh yes, of course, that's wrong, but it helps people do research and get things done. And as, I think, I mentioned the other day",

What was that wonderful project of trying to make a walking machine for four years in-- there was a project to make a robot walk. And there was only one of it, so first, only one student at a time can do research on it. And most of the time, something's broken, and you're fixing it. So you end up that you sort of get five or 10 hours a week on your laboratory physical robot. At the same time, Ed Friedkin had a student who tried to make a walking robot, and it was a stick figure on the screen. I forgot the student's name. But anyway, he simulated gravity and a few other things. And in a couple of weeks, he had a pretty good robot that could walk, and go around turns, and bank. And if you simulated an oily floor, it could slip and fall, which we considered the high point of the demo actually. So there we find--",

And if you want to dig deeper, it might be a good idea to go to the web and type in Aaron Sloman, S-L-O-M-A-N. And you'll get to his website, which is something like that. And Sloman is a sort of philosopher who can program. There are a handful of them in the world, and he has lots of interesting ideas that nobody's gotten to carry out. So I recommend. Who else is-- Pat, do you ever recommend anyone else? PAT: No. PROFESSOR: What? I'm trying to think.",

But Sloman is the only person, I'd say, is a sort of real professional philosopher, who tries to program, at least, some of his ideas. And he has successful students, who have made larger systems work. So if you get tired of me, and you ought to, then go look at this guy, and see who he recommends. OK, who has a good question to ask? AUDIENCE: So Marty, I'm talking about how we have a lot of words for emotions. Why can we only have one word for cause? PROFESSOR: It's a mystery, but I spent most of the couple of days making this list bigger. But these aren't-- you know, these are things that you do when you're thinking. You make analogies. If you have multiple goals, you try to pick the most important one. Or in some cases, if you have several goals, maybe you should try to achieve the easiest one,",

But a lot of people think mostly in England that logic is a good way to do reasoning, and that's completely wrong. Because in logic, first of all, you can't do analogies at all, except at a very high level. It takes four or five nested quantifiers to say, A is to B as C is to which of the following five. So I've never seen anyone do analogical thinking using formalogic, first order or higher order predicate calculus. What's logic good for? Its great after you've solved a problem. Because then you can formalize what you did and see if some of the things you did weren't unnecessary. In other words, after you've got the solution to a problem, what you've got by going through a big search, you finally found a path from A to Z. And now, you can see if the assumptions that you had to make to bridge all these various little gaps were all essential or not.",

PROFESSOR: Well, because you have to make a list of hypotheses, and then let me see if I can find Evans. The trouble is-- darn, Evans name is in a picture. And Word can't look inside its pictures. Can PowerPoint find words in its illustrations? Why don't I use PowerPoint? Because I've discovered that PowerPoint can't read pictures made by other programs in the Microsoft Word suite. The drawing program in Word is pretty good, and then there's an operation in Word, which will make a PowerPoint out of what you drew. And it's 25 years since Microsoft hasn't fixed the fatal errors that it makes when you do that. In other words, I don't think that the PowerPoint and Word people communicate. And they both make a lot of money,",

PROFESSOR: Well, you can do anything in logic, if you try hard enough, but A is to B as C is to X is a four part relation. And you'd need a whole pile of quantifiers, and how would you know what to do next? Yes? AUDIENCE: Talk a bit about the situation in which we are able to perform some sort of action, like really fluently and really well, but we cannot describe what we're doing. And the example I give is, say, I'm an expert African drummer from Africa, and I can make these really complicated rhythms. But if you asked me, what did you just do? I had no idea how to describe it. And in that case, do you think the person is capable of-- I guess, do you think the person-- we can say that the person understands this, even though they cannot explain it. PROFESSOR: Well, if you take an extreme form of that, you can't explain why you used any particular word for anything. There's no reason. It's remarkable how well people can do in everyday life",

What do those people think about it, what they'll tell you about? I was reading something, which said, it's going to be very hard to understand these areas. Because each neuron is connected to 100,000 little fibers. Well, some of them are. And I bet they don't do much, except sort of set the bias for some large collection of other neurons. But if you ask somebody, how did you think of such a word? They will tell you some story or anecdote. But they won't be able to describe some sort of procedure, which is, say, in terms of a language, like lisp. And say, I can't this and that, and I took the clutter of this in the car of that. And I put them in this register, and then I swapped that with-- You don't see theories of how the mind works in psychology today.

They've got almost the whole circuit of how when the frog sees a fly, it manages to turn its head that way, and stick its tongue out, and catch it. But in the case of a human, I've never seen any theory of how any person thinks of anything. There's artificial intelligence, which has high level theories of semantic representations. And there's neuroscience, which has good theories of some parts of locomotion and some parts of sensory systems. And to this day, there's nothing much in between. David, here, has decided to go from one to the other, and a former student of mine Bob Hearn has done a little bit on both. And I bet there are 20 or 30 people around the country, who are trying to bridge the gap between symbolic artificial intelligence and mappings of the nervous system.

AUDIENCE: So presumably to build a human life for artificial intelligence, we need to perfectly model our own intelligence, which means that we are the system. We ourself are the system that we're trying the understand. PROFESSOR: Well, it doesn't have to be exactly. I mean, people are different, and the typical person looks like they have 400 different brain centers doing slightly different things or very different things. And we have these examples. In many cases, if you lose a lot of your brain, you're very badly damaged. And in other cases, you recover and become just about as smart as you were. There's probably a few cases, where you got rid of something that was holding you back, but it's hard to prove that. We don't need a theory of how people work yet, and the nice thing about AI is that we could eventually get models, which are pretty good at solving what people call everyday common sense problems. And probably in many respects, they're not the way the human mind works, but it doesn't matter.",

I'll do this few psychological experiments and see what's wrong with that theory and how to change it. So at some point, there'll be people making AI systems, comparing them to particular people, and trying to make them fit. The trouble is nowadays, it takes a few months, if you get a really good new idea, to program it. I think there's something wrong with programming languages, and what we need is a-- we need a programming language, where the instructions describe goals and then subgoals. And then finally, you might say, well, let's represent this concept by a number or a semantic network of some sort. Yes? AUDIENCE: That idea of having a programming language where you define goals. PROFESSOR: Is there a goal oriented language? AUDIENCE: So there is kind of one.

Yes, I guess database query languages are on the track, but Wolfram Alpha seems to be better than I thought. Well, he was running it, and Steve Wolfram was giving this demo at a meeting we were at on Monday. And he'd say, well, maybe I'll just say this, and it always worked. So maybe either the language is better than I thought, or Wolfram is better than I thought or something. Remarkable guy. Yes? AUDIENCE: So I liked this example of you only remember a name after you've given up consciously trying to think about it. Do you think this is a matter of us being able to set up back our processes, and then there's either some delay. Like we give off- there's some delay in the process, where we don't have the ability to correctly terminate processes.",

PROFESSOR: Well, there's a lot of nice questions about things like that. How many processes can you run at once in your brain? And I was having a sort of argument the other day about music, and I was wondering if-- I see a big difference between Bach and the composers who do counterpoint. Counterpoint, you usually have several versions of a very similar idea. Maybe there's one theme, and you have it playing. And then another voice comes in. And it has that theme upside down, or a variation of it, or in some cases, exactly the same. And then it's called a canon. So the tour de force in classical music is when you have two, or three, or four versions of the same thought going on at once at different times. And my feeling was that in popular music, or if you take a typical band, then there",

And there's various instruments doing different things, but you don't have several doing the same thing. I might be wrong, and somebody said, well, some popular music has a lot of counterpoint. I'm just not familiar with it. But I think that's-- if you're trying to solve a hard problem, it's fairly easy to look at the problem in several different ways. But what's hard is to look at it in several almost the same ways that are slightly different. Because probably, if you believe that the brain is made of agents, or resources, or whatever, you probably don't have duplicate copies of ones that do important things. Because that would take up too much real estate. Anyway, I might be completely wrong about jazz. Somebody, maybe they have just as complicated overlapping things as Bach and the contrapuntal composers did. Yeah? AUDIENCE: What is the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence? Is it some sort of application, or is it more philosophical?",

PROFESSOR: I think we're going to need it, because the disaster that we're working our way toward is that people are going to live longer. And they'll become slightly less able, so we'll have billions of 200-year-old people who can barely get around. And there won't be enough people to import from underdeveloped countries to, or they won't be able to afford them. So we're going to have to have machines that take care of us. Of course, that's just a transient. Because at some point, then you'll download your brain into a machine and fix everything that's wrong. So we'll need robots for a few years or a few decades. And then we'll be them, and we won't need them anymore. But it's an important problem. What's going to happen in the next 100 years? You're going to have 20 billion 200-year-olds and nobody to take care of them, unless we get AI. Nobody seems particularly sad about that.",

And nobody in the audience seemed interested, and I'd say, well, suppose you could live 400 years. And most of the people-- then I asked, what was the trouble? They said, wouldn't it be boring? So then I tried it, again, in a couple of other lectures. And if you ask a bunch of scientists, how would you like to live 400 hundreds years? Everyone says, yay, and you ask them why. And they say, well, I'm working on a problem that I might not have time to solve. But if I had 400 years, I bet I could get somewhere on it, and the other people don't have any goal. That's my cold blooded view of the typical non-scientist. There's nothing for them to do in the long run. Who can think of what should people do? What's your goal? How many of you want to live 400 years? Wow, there must be scientists here. Try it on some crowd and let me know what happens.",

AUDIENCE: I think the differentiating factor is whether or not your 400 years is just going to be the repetition of 100 years experience, or if it'll start to like take off, then you'll start to learn better. You'll progress. PROFESSOR: Right. I've seen 30 issues of the Big Bang, and I don't look forward to the next one anymore. Because they're getting to be all the same. Although, it's the only thing on TV that has scientists. Seriously, I hardly read anything, except journals and science fiction. Yeah? AUDIENCE: What's the motivation to have robots take care of as we age as opposed to enhancing our own cognitive abilities, or our prosthetic body, or something more societiable? What's the joy of living, if you can't do anything, and somebody takes care of you? PROFESSOR: I can't think of any advantage, except that medicine isn't getting-- you know, the age of unhandicapped people went up at one year every four since the late 1940s. So the lifespan is-- so that's 60 years.",

Now I suspected you only have to fix a dozen genes, or who knows? Nobody really has a good estimate, but you can probably double the lifespan, if you could fix. Nobody knows, but maybe there's just a dozen processes that would fix a lot of things. And then you could live longer without deteriorating, and lots of people might get bored. But they'll self select. I don't know. What's your answer? AUDIENCE: I feel that AI is more-- the goal is not to help take care of people, but to complement what we already have to entertain us. PROFESSOR: You could also look at them as our descendants. And we will have them replace us and just as a lot of people consider their children to be the next generation of them. And I know a lot of people who don't, so it's not a universal.",

If you were sure that there were lots of others, then it wouldn't seem so important. Who is the new Carl Sagan? Is there any? Is there a public scientist? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: Who? AUDIENCE: He's the guy who is on Nova all the time. PROFESSOR: Oh, Tyson? AUDIENCE: Bryan Green. PROFESSOR: Bryan Green, he's very good. Tyson is the astrophysicist. Bryan Green is a great actor. He's quite impressive.",

PROFESSOR: Well, I think that's a funny question. Because if we're programming it, we can make sure that the machine has a very good abstract, but correct model of how it works, which people don't. So people have a sense of self, but it's only a sense of self. And it's just plain wrong in almost every respect. So it's a really funny question. Because when you make a machine that really has a good useful representation of what it is and how it works, it might be quite different, have different attitudes than a person does. Like you might not consider itself very valuable and say, oh, I could make something that's even better than me and jump into that. So it wouldn't have the-- it might not have any self protective reaction. Because if you could improve yourself,",

The cable now instead of naturally lining that area actually naturally lies in the area where it doesn't work. PROFESSOR: Well, what it needs is a little ramp, so that it would slide out. I mean, it would only take a minute to file it down, so that it would slide out. AUDIENCE: Right. PROFESSOR: But they didn't. I forget why I mentioned that, but-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

Whereas for the engineer, somebody's told him what to do, make a better cabled connector. So he's going to spend 90% of his time actually solving the problem and only 10% of the time trying to decide what problem to solve. So I don't see any difference between artists and engineers, except that the artist has more problems to solve than he could possibly solve and usually ends up by picking a really dumb one, like let's have a Saint and three angels. Where will I put the third angel? That's the engineering part. It's just improvising, so to me, the media lab makes sense. The artists or semi artists and the scientists are doing almost the same thing. And if you look at the more arty people, they're a little more concerned with human social relations and this and that. And others are more concerned with very technical, specific aspects of signal processing or semantic",

And then, of course, the great moments are when you run into people, like Leonardo and Michelangelo, who get some idea that requires a great new technical innovation that nobody has ever done. And it's hard to separate them. I think there's some place, where Leonardo realizes that the lens in the eye would mean that the image is upside down on the retina, and he couldn't stand that. So there's a diagram he has, where the cornea is curved enough to invert the image, and then the lens inverts it back again, which is contrary to fact. But he has a sketch showing that he was worried about, if the image were upside down on the retina, wouldn't things look upside down? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] question.

But I've never seen any claim of that it works. They wrote a ferocious review of the Society of Mind, which came out in 1986.

And then, I think, in 1970, so that's sort of after 12 years of discovering interesting things. Their main discovery was the gadget that they called GPS, which is not global positioning satellite, but general problem solver. And you can look it up in the index of my book, and there's a sort of one or two page description. But if you ever get some spare time, search the web for their early paper by Newell and Simon on how GPS worked. Because it's really fascinating. What it did is it looked at a problem, and found some features of it, and then looked up in a table saying that, if there's this difference between what you have and what you want, use such and such a method. So it was sort of what I called it. I renamed it a difference engine as a sort of joke, because the first computer in history was the one called the difference engine. But it was for predicting tides and things. Anyway, they did some beautiful work.",

And what they did is got some people to solve problems, and they trained the people to talk while they're solving the problem. So some of them were a little cryptograms, like if each letter stands for a digit, I've forgotten it. Pat, do you remember the name, one of those problems? John plus Joe-- John plus Jane equals Robert or something. I'm sure that has no solution, but those are called cryptarithmetic. So they had dozens or hundreds of people who would be trained to talk aloud while they're solving little puzzles like that. And then what they did was look at exactly what the people said and how long they took. And in some cases, where they move their eyes, they had an eye tracking machine. And then they wrote programs that showed how this guy solved a couple of these cryptarithmetic problems. Then they ran the program on a new one. And in some rare cases, it actually solved the other problem.",

PROFESSOR: It has inexplicable points at which the person suddenly gives up on that representation. And he says, oh, well, I guess R must be 3. Did I erase? Well. Yes, it's got episodes, and they can't account for the-- you have these little jerks in the script where the model changes. And-- [COUGHS] sorry. And they announced those to be mysteries, and say, here's a place where the person has decided the strategy isn't working and starts over, or is changing something. The amazing part is that their model sometimes fits what the person says. For 50 or even 100 steps, the guy's saying, oh, I think z must be 2 and p must be 7.

And he spent about six weeks moving this sciatic nerve from the leg up to the arm of this tadpole. And then they all got some fungus and died. So I said, what are you going to do? And he said, well, I guess I'll have to do it again. And I switched from biology to mathematics. AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING] PROFESSOR: But in fact, he discovered the growth hormone that he thought came from the nerve and made the-- if you cut off the limb bud of a tadpole, it'll grow another one and grow a whole-- it was a newt, I'm sorry. It's salamander. It'll grow a new hand. If you wait till it's got a substantial hand, it won't grow a new one. But he discovered the hormone that makes it do that. Yeah.

So we have a whole lot of if-thens, and we have to choose which if. I don't think I have a good theory of that. Yes, if you have a huge rule-based system and they're-- what does Randy Davis do? What if you have a rule-based system, and a whole lot of ifs fit the condition? Do you just take the one that's most often worked? Or if nothing seems to be working, do you-- you certainly don't want to keep trying the same one. I think I mentioned Doug [? Lenat's ?] rule. Some people will assign probabilities to things, to behaviors, and then pick the way to react in proportional to the probability that that thing has worked in the past. And Doug [? Lenat ?] thought of doing that, but instead, he just put the things in a list. And whenever a hypothesis worked better than another one, he would raise it, push it toward the front of the list. And then whenever there was a choice, he would pick-- of all the rules that fit, he would pick the one",

AUDIENCE: So earlier in the class, you mentioned that the rule-based methods didn't work, and that several other methods were tried between the [INAUDIBLE] [? immunities. ?] Could you go into a bit about what these other methods were that have been tried? PROFESSOR: I don't mean to say they don't work. Rule-based methods are great for some kinds of problems. So most systems make money, and if you're trying to make hotel reservations and things, this business of rule-based systems, it has a nice history. A couple of AI researchers, really, notably Ed Feigenbaum, who was a student of Newell and Simon, started a company for making rule-based systems. And company did pretty well for a while, and they maintained that only an expert in artificial intelligence could be really good at making rule-based systems. And so they had a lot of customers, and quite a bit of success for a year or two.",

And the market disappeared, because it turned out that you didn't have to be good at anything in particular to make rule-based systems work. But for doing harder problems, like translating from one language to another, you really needed to have more structure, and you couldn't just take the probabilities of words being in a sentence, but you had to look for diagrams and trigrams, and have some grammar theory, and so forth. But generally, if you have a ordinary data-processing problem, try a rule-based system first, because if you understand what's going on, it's a good chance you'll get things to work. I'm sure that's what the Hawkins thing started out as. I don't have any questions.",

And it's full of diagrams showing the main behaviors that they were able to observe of various low-cost animals.

And Lorenz was particularly interested in how animals got attached to their parents-- that is, for those animals that do get attached to their parents. Like alligator babies live in the alligator's mouth for quite a while. It's a good, safe place. And Lorenz would catch birds just when they're hatching. And within the first day or so, some baby birds get attached to whatever large moving object is nearby. And that was often Konrad Lorenz, rather than",

And he has various theories of how they recognize him. But you could do that too. Anyway, that was quite a field, this thing called ethology. And between 1920 and 1950-- 1930, I guess, 1950-- there were lots of people studying the behavior of animals. And Ed Wilson is probably the most well-known successor to Lorenz and Tinbergen.

Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. PROFESSOR: There was one that if you taught a worm to turn left when there was a bright light, or right, and put some of its RNA into another worm, that worm would copy that reaction even though it hadn't been trained. And this was-- AUDIENCE: That wasn't worms. That was slugs. PROFESSOR: Slugs. AUDIENCE: I think it was [INAUDIBLE] replace the [INAUDIBLE] or something. AUDIENCE: Some little snail-like thing. And nobody was ever able to replicate it. So that rumor spread around the world quite happily, and there was a great science fiction story-- I'm trying to remember-- in which somebody got to eat some alien's RNA and got magical powers. AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING] PROFESSOR: I think it's Larry Niven, who is wonderful at taking little scientific ideas and making a novel out of them.",

AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING] Vernor Vinge, and Larry Niven, and Frederik Pohl seem to be able to do that. Or at least on every page. I don't know about every paragraph. Yeah. AUDIENCE: To follow up on that question, it seems to me that you almost were saying that if this machinery exists, the difference between these sort of animals would be in [INAUDIBLE]. And I think on [INAUDIBLE],, we can create like a chicken or a human [INAUDIBLE].. PROFESSOR: Well, no. I don't think that most animals have scripts. Some might, but I'd say that--",

Have you seen pictures of an octopus picking up a shell, and walking to some quiet place, and it's got-- there's some movies of this on the web. And then it drops the shell and climbs under it and disappears. It's hard to imagine programming a robot to do that. Yeah.

One thing is that, for example, it looks like that all neurons are almost the same. Now, there's lots of difference in geometric features of them, but they all use the same one or two transmitters, and every now and then, you run across people saying, oh, neurons are incredibly complicated. They have 100,000 connections. You can find it if you just look up \"neuron\" on the web and get these essays explaining that nobody will ever understand them, because typically, a neuron is connected to 100,000 others, and blah, blah, blah. So it must be something inside the neuron that figures out all this stuff. As far as I can see, it looks out almost the opposite. Namely, probably the neuron hasn't changed for half a billion years very much, except in superficial ways in which it grows. Because if you changed any of the genes controlling",

The architecture would be all screwed up. So I suspect that the people who say, well, maybe the important memories of a neuron are inside it, because there's so many fibers and things. I bet it's sort of like saying the important memory in a computer is in the arsenic and phosphorus atoms of the semiconductor. So I think things have to be hierarchical in evolution, because if you're building later stuff on earlier stuff, then it's very hard to make any changes in the earlier stuff. So as far as I know, the neurons in sea anemones are almost identical to the neurons in mammals,",

Most systems have a state that they prefer to be in, like a state that they're most comfortable. Do you think the mind has such a state, or would it tend to certain places or something?

And it has about 10 disasters, like a big meteor coming and hitting the Earth. I forget the other 10, but I have it in here somewhere. So I generated another list of 10 to go with it. And so there are lots of bad things that could happen. But I think right now, that's not on the top of the list of disasters. Eventually, some hacker ought to be able to stop the net from working because it's not very secure. And while you're at it, you could probably knock out all of the navigation satellites and maybe set off a few nuclear reactors. But I don't think AI is the principal thing to worry about,",

Anybody know-- there was a movie called The Forbin Project, and it's about somebody who builds an AI, and it's trained to do some learning. And it's also the early days of the web, and it starts talking to another computer in Russia. And suddenly, it gets faster and faster, and takes over all the computers in the world, and gets control of all the missiles, because they're linked to the network. And it says, I will destroy all the cities in the world unless you clear off some island and start building the following machine. I think it's Sardinia or someplace. So they get bulldozers. And it starts building another machine, which it calls Colossus 2. And they ask, what's it going to do? And Colossus says, well, you see, I have detected that there's a really bad AI out in space,",

So instead of 10, 40, 50, 55, what if it was [? logistical, ?] like, good, fine, great, and you have to come up with a word that could potentially fit in that pattern.

And he was sure it was someone in the government. And this was getting pretty scary. And I was near the door, so I went and got [INAUDIBLE]---- it's a true story-- who was nearby, and I got [INAUDIBLE] to come in. And [INAUDIBLE] actually talked this guy down, and took him by the arm, and went somewhere, and I don't know what happened, but Wiener was really scared, because the guy kept keeping him from going out.
