What choices you're making and so let's use this as a working session and then over the course of the day we're going to hear from a number of other companies that are doing really interesting work and hopefully we'll cumulatively as a result of all of this. I think we'll all enrich our understanding of this very very fundamental topic Strategy Now What do we what have we kind of learned about how to think about strategy. Well, I think what we learned is that the instinct that most leaders have about success and and most people actually have about success is dangerous is is potentially distracting What I find is that when when you ask a company what success looks like The answer that you get, I get a lot is well, I want to be the best company in my industry",

I want to be the best that's success if I can be the best company in my industry I will succeed and that is a very natural human way to think. We all hope to be the best at what we do, but in business competition and what we've come to understand is that's actually not the way to think about success. The reason is that there is no best company. So it's pretty dangerous to try to do something that's impossible. There is no best Auto company, there is no best Insurance company, it all depends. It all depends there is no best, there's no one way to compete The biggest mistake in strategy is to think that there's only one way to compete, in every industry there are different ways to compete depending on ... What customer and customer needs you're actually trying to meet? So when you ask them the question what's the best car or the best car company You can't answer that because being the best all depends on",

There are lots of good ways to compete depending on who you're trying to serve. So the number one principle strategy is don't think this way Instead what you want to think about is how can I in my company be unique? How can I create unique value for the set of customers I choose to serve Strategy is fundamentally about choice It's making a set of choices and the most fundamental choice is Who am I trying to serve and One of the worst mistakes in strategy is to try to serve everybody You can't meet the need of every customer you just can't do it it's impossible I've seen hundreds of companies try it's impossible.

Sounds simple but most companies don't do it. Most companies are confused they lack clarity on what strategy is and they and in many companies the there is a fundamental inability to make choices. Which ultimately lead to lack of success. Now again in a country like India where growth has been relatively rapid you can ride you can ride the rising tide and do okay But I'm talking today about the companies are gonna be truly successful truly successful not the ones that are just bumping along with the market",

Here it is Strategy is a set of choices we make Long-term choices to distinguish ourselves from competitors. That's what it's all about. It defines how we're going to compete differently and It also really articulates the competitive advantages that we will seek to create and use in order to win Okay, so at a very high-level, this is how I would define strategy Again note the word long-term Strategies about long term it's not about tomorrow and the next day It's about the long term because strategy takes a long time to put in place and implement Strategies about distinguishing yourself being different If you're doing the same thing as your competitor, you don't have a strategy You're just trying to do the same thing better",

We'll talk about that in a minute Strategy is around choices what choices you make versus the choices that your competitors are making Strategy then is different than just we want to be number 1 or number 2. That's not a strategy Wanting to grow faster is not a strategy Those are goals, those are aspirations the strategy is the unique position that allows you to get to whatever goal you set We can't confuse the strategy and the goal We can't mix them up. We have to separate the goal we're trying to achieve and then the strategy is how we're gonna get there Strategy is not just one thing one step, strategy is not to go international. That's not a strategy You know raising R&D is not a strategy. Strategy is holistic It's the whole set of choices that you make collectively in order to position the company for success over time in the marketplace It's not just it's not one-step it's a set of steps Strategy involves all the functions.

There's another level of strategy which is what we call corporate strategy and That has to do with the overall strategy of the diversified or multi business company We got a lot of conglomerates. I don't like the word conglomerate Conglomerate is not a strategy We've got a lot of companies though that are more than one business We got to have a strategy for each one of the businesses",

That's a mistake We've got to keep these levels separately and we'll talk about these briefly as we have time now let's talk about business unit strategy and not go quite quickly because Again, I'm hopeful that most of you are pretty well grounded in the key ideas here so what we understand is in it can in a business a particular business The drivers of success and the key elements of strategy have to do with the industry itself the business itself and the position we choose to occupy in that business Strategy is both together.

We've got to understand that business by business and then of course we have to make those choices about where we're going to compete But one of the things I I find over and over again is Often the health of your industry is just as important as how good a position you have If you're in a industry that's in trouble that's failing You may have a great position but that's not very valuable so so we got to learn to worry about our industry, too We have to help our industry thrive not just focus only on our own position again These are things that we've learned from many many many examples. In terms of industry analysis hopefully everybody finds this familiar You know we after you know 20 or 25 years of work we have overwhelming evidence that really industry competition is driven by these competitive forces That we introduced many years ago now Those competitive forces collectively drive The fundamental attractiveness of the industry, the average profitability in the industry Yeah, yeah, here's a simple example in the heavy truck industry and in our country",

For example So you're so you're buying from suppliers who have a lot of clout Because they have their own relationship with the end customer So that squeezes the truck companies the truck manufacturers in the middle This is in in in in North America Primarily but the same basic structure exists in many other parts of the world It actually isn't that hard to enter in the industry And the threat of entry and entry barriers are a key part of industry analysis And you know it's actually harder to get the dealer network than it is to actually get the parts and assemble the truck And then of course trucks are always competing with substitute substitutes Yet all of us hopefully understand what a substitute is a substitute is a different way of meeting the need That's not this is the same as your product but meets the same need that your product does So if you're trucking if you're a truck manufacturer You know, the customer doesn't need a truck if they're going to use the railroad or if they're going to use water transportation, so particularly You know as railroads railroads have been a real tough competitor for trucks Over the years. Okay, so This is a classic example of industry analysis. It's something that is timeless",

Well, this is not something I want to buy. I want to make my own industrial gases in-house and Make them right right in my factory right on the production line. Ok. So again, here's an industry your first look says Not so good. I don't want to play here. That's your first instinct but again what we learn about industry analysis is we've got to we've got to be sophisticated We can't just take the superficial look at the industry, we've got to dig down a little bit and if we dig down in this industry, what we've learned is actually it's quite an exciting and interesting industries in fact the companies in this industry have done very well and the reason is that the superficial look doesn't really get at the true industry structure so just an example is the Probably the most interesting thing about the industry is that the cost of transportation are very high?

Customer will pay you more for it Because you're delivering some something the customer thinks is better It could be designed it could be image it could be functionality, it could be service. It could be almost anything But you know competitive advantage number one is differentiating and getting a higher price and If you're differentiating you better get a higher price Because if you're not getting a higher price, then you have to ask, are we really differentiating if nobody's willing to pay us extra? are we really better and That's a kind of a tough honest question we have to ask ourselves. The other kind of competitive advantage is lower cost If we can actually do something cheaper and more efficiently",

Are we we on the path to differentiate? Are we on a path to be the lowest cost? Those are both good pass depending on the circumstances but we we gotta usually decide which path we're gonna be on because if we're gonna really differentiate and have better quality and better service and You know better educated Salesforce. It's gonna be hard to at the same time be lower cost That's what we've learned so we've got to figure out what path were on And then we have to turn it into a strategy using the value chain And again, I hope everybody here is familiar with that concept it's quite embedded now and management thinking the value chain says You know for any business there's a whole set of things that we have to do in order to conduct that business Logistical things, operating things which could be manufacturing, marketing, sales service, supply chain",

There's a lot of best practice in every industry and What we've learned is if you're not using best practice, you're gonna lose No matter what your strategy is If you're not buying the latest manufacturing equipment your competitors are gonna win You're gonna you're gonna you're gonna give up too much cost and quality through that So what we have to understand is in any company, we have two jobs one is we got to implement all the best practices? That we can find If we see somebody doing a better approach to customer, you know customer care You know, we better look hard at that and make sure that we're at least at some, you know, threshold level of best practice That's operational effectiveness",

No matter what strategy we have?

What customers are we actually trying to serve? Again so many companies the customers they have they sort of got by luck But most important ideas in strategies you've got to choose your customers you actually have to choose who you want your customers to be and If you choose I want all customers. I want to serve every single customer. That's usually not a good choice Because customers have very different needs Particularly in a complex economy like like this one You know another another Question, you've got to ask of the customers I choose to serve which of the needs of that they have do I want to actually meet uniquely well Again a lot of companies just fall into the idea that anything the customer wants, I'm gonna try to provide But actually, you know, most great strategies don't do that Or at very least they're very specific about which customer group and then they say, okay, I'm gonna go after this customer group",

They actually figured out that the small customers The people that owned one truck and drove that truck for their living That was that was the really interesting customer in this industry So they built the whole strategy around this narrow group of customers about 25 to 30 percent of all the customers that buy trucks are buy one or two trucks and They often drive their own truck. Okay Second Test of a great strategy again. Think about your own company here a Distinctive value chain, if you if you don't operate the business differently Your value chain isn't going to be real You've got to have a different operating model that aligns with your positioning",

You just bought and You get the opportunity to actually take the furniture home yourself You don't get somebody with a van, you know delivering dropping off completed furniture at your house IKEA understood that that was that was good most a lot of customers like that But the customers they liked they wanted to serve who was very price-sensitive They were willing to deliver themselves They would they would deliver their own furniture And by by doing it that way and by also having inbound logistics in Not entire sofas, but the parts for a sofa in a box",

They're really high quality really low cost that worked for her and this tells you something very important about strategy and that is that one of the things a great strategy does is it doesn't please every customer If you're trying to please every customer You don't have a strategy A good strategy makes some customers unhappy If every customer is happy you're in trouble If every possible customer in the industry likes what you're doing then the odds are that you'll never really be successful",

Here's here's Paccar, you know another critical part of a successful strategy is the concept of trade-offs a Trade-off is where in order to deliver one benefit you give up on another benefit and that's what IKEA did you know, they to get that really low price of nicely style furniture and in order to do that you had to go through an awkward experience in the store You had to take the product home yourself, and you had to put it together yourself And that was a trade-off that they were willing to make because they understood that's what their customers really ... that was the trade-off they wanted to make Strategies about choice About choosing what you want to do? But one of the phrases that I Said at some point and I found has been very powerful is the essence of strategy is what you choose not to do It's the service you don't offer it's the functions you don't provide It's the benefit you don't offer",

It takes like two three years to implement a strategy Because you've got to get all those pieces aligned around what your what your ultimate position is And continuity becomes crucial okay again, you can look at some of these examples and talk about it even further When we think about strategy one of the things that I you know I find very helpful to think about and might be helpful for you is what kind of competition are we creating in our industry and And the wrong answer is we're creating a zero-sum competition we're all doing the same thing beating each other up on price That's not the competition we want But we want to create is really more of a positive some competition where we're all have a different strategy",

We're actually the whole industry can be more attractive and competitors can do well in terms of corporate strategy Again, I've already covered the idea that there's multiple levels if you're in a very large group, there might be a third level There might be groups of businesses Clumped together because the old company and the whole company has so many businesses that to manage it.
