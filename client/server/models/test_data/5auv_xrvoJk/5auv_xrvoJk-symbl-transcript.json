We're going to go through that and talk about the readings. I'm going to do a little calling on you and helping you take the class through the readings. And then the six or seven things I'm going to do-- history of money; ledgers; fiat currency, central banks, and credit cards; the role of money; some early digital money. You had the Clark reading as to a bunch of failed attempts. All the way through a little bit of mobile money, all the way up to Starbucks and Alipay. And yet, the riddle remains. We're going to get really deep into Bitcoin in the next three classes. But this is to give some foundational bits of money and ledgers and central banking and technology. And then, of course, I always like to finish the class talking a little bit about why we're doing what we're doing between now and then. Even though the readings are required, I know you're all busy. I know that you've all got a bunch of classes. And like good business students and business people, you optimize. So I'm trying to give you a sense of why you might read it, rather than it's required, at the end of each class and how it fits into the course narrative. And then we'll do a little bit of conclusions. So the survey results. What did you want to learn? This is really your class, and I'm going to learn as much from you. But hopefully, we're going to cover what you want. So here's a list of those things that were at least written by two of you. First was technical things. 18 of you said understanding blockchain technology. Hopefully, we get to that, but you might find that you'll want to do more after this class. The ecosystem and being able to have an educated discussion, sort of the dinner party conversation around blockchain. I think we'll be successful. But at the end of the semester, we're going to pull these slides up again, and we'll see how we did as a group. You all talked a lot about applications. How can you actually apply it, learning in the venture space and thinking about where it really works in the world. And I think we're going to spend a lot of time on that in the second half. But all throughout, we're going to be talking about the economics and what's the reality versus the hype. You also wanted to understand its impact on people's lives, the regulation. About six of you said something about regulation. I'm glad, because we're only doing one lecture on that. But we're going to spread it out, because as we talked about in our first class-- and I'm honored Larry's here again-- but we're going to always be thinking about Larry's four ways. And I see-- is it Jihei? What are Larry Lessig's-- you shook your head yes. "

I spent a lot of time in Washington in politics, but the markets and how the commercial enterprise and the economy grinds up against technology and sort of grinds up against the law-- and then, of course, just social normative behavior. These four forces, in almost everything one does in life, you will find. And so I just ask you to always, whether it's one reading or another reading, bring that into your thought process of this class. I'm not going to assign Larry's assignment. I didn't know he was even going to be here. But I've always thought it's a good discipline to think, OK, what are the commercial realities, the markets? What's the technology, even if it's in an earlier day and it's the technology of the car replacing the horse and carriage? How does government or the official sector put it into a set of standards that are required? And then how do we, as a society, even if it's not required, just have our behaviors? Those are the four forces. So that's why. I probably just failed Larry's class, but that's how I've thought about it. I did, probably, right? No, he's shaking his head. But regulation is just one of those four forces. And that's why I pause there. And so we'll have it in every class, but only one lecture. Money and markets, that's one of the other forces. Five of you said you want to make money, and I applaud those who said that, because own it. You're in a business school. Why not? But investing and trends. Now, there was a bunch of other miscellaneous topics. I'm not going to go through them. I kind of thought the last two were interesting-- anecdotes from my past. I'm not sure who said that. I'm not sure what you want to know about-- my three daughters, my running, or this Wall Street stuff and finance. And I'd like to understand hyperbitcoinization, as well, but I don't know who asked that question. I don't know what it is, so I'll try to figure out what hyper-- does anyone want to own up to that question? They were anonymous. All right. All right. So today's study questions. What's the role of money historically and in today's digital economy? And this is when I'm going to look for discussion. So does anybody want to tell me what the role of money-- what would be your answer to this? Anton? "

Society together says-- it's not just a social normative behavior. It's a law. One must accept this. And the US and the UK and many countries it says for all debts, public and private. So a debt to the government or a debt in a store. We're going to get to, later, as to when is it true that somebody has to take your cash. But I'm going to hold off on that in a minute and talk about it. But I think, also, Jihei said-- it was somewhere between Sean and Eric, both physically in the class and in terms of her articulation-- that fiat currency might not have anything inherently behind it. But gold mostly doesn't have anything inherently behind it. And then some forms of currency, like grain, had more. So maybe it's a continuum. Maybe it's not black and white, 100% or 0%. And then we're going to talk a little bit about how Bitcoin fits into it. And our next three classes are going to be really into the technology of Bitcoin, but just a little bit of teasing out before I go through some lecture slides. Who wants to talk about how Bitcoin might fit into this history of money? And then I'm going to return to that question in about 45 minutes and ask you again. Does anybody want to say from the readings? And you remind me your name? "

But you have to comply with all the other laws.

One still has to pay your taxes if you're gaining or losing on this investment. The Federal Reserve and other authorities around the globe still want to insure for financial stability.

And interestingly, they have to compute the value of the wages to do withholding taxes, because the US government will not accept taxes in bitcoin. So they figure out the fair market value-- and there are companies in the US that pay people in bitcoin who are doing development work around blockchain applications. But the taxes need to be computed and analyzed and then paid in US dollars. There was a legislative initiative in Arizona earlier this year where a state legislature wanted to have Arizona be the first state in the land to accept bitcoin for taxes. But it failed in committee. It didn't even get a full vote of-- I can't remember if it was the Arizona Senate or the Arizona House of Delegates. So just a little walk through the history. I was going to do a little history of money and have some fun. So in Ethiopia, people put together salt bars. This is not that long ago. Salt, as Jihei said earlier, is really valuable in society, and they standardize the shape and size. And so here's salt bars. We're going to get to, a little bit later, all the characteristics of money. But what else do you think a salt bar in Ethiopia, as opposed to maybe some other country-- what did it have, as well, as to why people might use that? "

They got debased when Europeans started to realize that they were accepted as a value. And it's a very sad and terrible history, too, because it's related to the whole slave trade. But that the Europeans could figure out that societies accepted this as something of value, but they also debased that currency and they debased the land and captured people as slaves. It was quite a collection of not particularly good things going on. Tally sticks in England. Does anybody, from the readings-- because there was a little bit of the debate in the first reading about the history of money-- want to chat? And I'll pull up the Rai stones from Yap. How this fits into that first reading and the debate between did money come from a history of barter, or did money come from a history of ledgers and credit, which is kind of a setup of that first reading? Any thoughts? Which ones of these four bits of money, early money, are more about maybe barter? "

So on the island of Yap, I can assure you, these stones could not be used for anything else. Does anyone know, because it was outside the readings, what made these stones so scarce? So Rai stones were quarried on an island about 200 kilometers away from Yap, so were they exceedingly hard to get, like gold, like mining of gold. What else is mined these days that might be a money?

And he went to the other island, and he started quarrying and came back and forth. And within a few years, the whole economic system collapsed. We moved to metal money. At first, it wasn't really stamped. It was just heavy. It was hard to quarry. Bronze in Rome. There was some China and Sweden. These were starting to be stamped by the official sector. And then we had minted money starting somewhere around 2,500 years ago. And there's debates as to whether it started in Greece or in China. But where an official emblem was placed upon a scarce resource that was used. Paper money came along, in a sense, for what reason? Why did society first tip in to paper money? "

And I spent five years running something called a Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and so I guess I learned a lot about warehouse receipts, commodity receipts, where you put a commodity in a warehouse. And then you got a piece of paper that said, yes, you have that commodity there. So the first paper monies were basically warehouse receipts in China. Because whatever it was-- grain or gold. And then you had a piece of paper backing it. These are five pound notes from England and the continental notes of the US. But that note in China is about 700 years old.

And ledgers have both sides, too. And when we're talking about Bitcoin, Bitcoin, you will see, is a mechanism to store transactions. Some other blockchains, like Ethereum, stores balances. So even in the blockchain world, you will see some that are balance ledgers and some which are transaction ledgers, not to lose you and confuse you. It's an important part of what is blockchain. Some types of ledgers. I just mentioned one-- transactions versus balance. George Washington's ledger, by the way, I think was a transaction ledger. He was just keeping a list of sales and movements.

That is at the heart of our system of banking and is at the heart of our system of financial markets, where the central bank is like a general ledger for money, and every commercial bank, all 9,000 of them or so in the US, in essence keep a subledger for money. But they do not have control of what I will call the master ledger or general ledger at the Federal Reserve. Then, a third distinction about ledger is a single entry.

They're not going to be the heart and soul of this class, but Bitcoin, which is a transaction ledger, Ethereum, which is a balance ledger, our financial system, which is all set up on ledgers is a relevant sort of subtext. You don't have to be afraid of it, just as you don't have to be afraid of hashing power that we'll be talking about on Thursday and cryptography. You have to have some sort of basic sense of where does Bitcoin fit in, in terms of ledgers. I didn't feel this slide in. You'll find out it's blank.

And what you'll find is the characteristics of a good ledger is also, in some part, similar to the characteristics of good money. They're not identical, but they overlap a lot. Payment systems-- I'm just going to say one line about it. It's a method, basically, to amend and record changes in a ledger for money. I know it's not what you usually think about a payment system. But if you go into Starbucks and buy a cup of coffee and use your cell phone, aren't you really just amending a set of ledgers? Starbucks' ledger goes up, and yup, your ledger goes down. Well, your monetary ledger goes up. Your utility, your fulfillment from that latte might go up. I'm talking about the financial ledger. So I just wanted to ground-- when we talk about payment systems, think about it's really just a way to amend, usually, two parties ledgers'-- one going up, one going down. Now, in an earlier time, it was handing somebody a bit of gold or a bit of silver, and it was not recorded on central ledgers. But we already live in an age of electronics, so this is really what a payment system largely is. It's not entirely. There's still some other ways to do finance. So what were some early forms of payment systems that did just that, that moved and changed ledgers? They're called negotiable orders. I would dare say that most of you probably have not used negotiable orders of withdrawal that much in the last week or the last month. Has anybody here written a personal check in the last week? But in an earlier era, it would have been the whole class. Anybody in the class not even have a checkbook? 3/4 of the class. Larry, how's that make you feel? "

So some early money that we already talked about that was ledger where the tally sticks in England and the Yap stone. These were ledger types and forms of money and was kind of interesting. So ledgers didn't just come with electricity and computers. So now let's get back to fiat currency, the heart of the earlier question. We already talked about it, so let's see how the professor did, because you already said some of the things that you said were fiat currency. One, social and economic consensus. I'm in the school that it's just part of the history. It's not that different than everything that came, even though it built on that promissory note from China 700 years ago and the private bank notes and the goldsmiths in the 1700s. But ultimately, governments took control. It represents central bank liabilities, and that's important. It's a liability of a central bank. It's not an asset. It's their liability side. But it's also-- guess what? There's a second form of money. And that's when you have a deposit in a bank, that's a liability of a commercial bank. Central bank is the top gold standard, in a sense. Using the word gold, but it's the top ledger. Commercial banks are like subledgers, in a sense. Please, Alan? "

But when paper money started, it was not backed by gold. We had a period of the gold standard. We were on and off of it. We fell off of it during World War I. We went back on it. It would be a false narrative to say that we were on the gold standard for our first 140 years. I just wanted to clear that up.

And they have to record it on the ledger of that bank. That is what they are-- and the US government, which is technically separate from the central bank-- or the UK government or the Chinese government. they're all technically separate from their banks-- People's Bank of China or the Bank of England. Their governments are saying they will accept it for payments against taxes. So there's a set of social constructs. I'm going to just go through this to answer your question. It relies on a system of ledgers, and it's an integration of those ledgers between the banking system and the commercial banks. In the US, we have about 9,000 commercial banks. And what the Federal Reserve is saying-- but it's true about the People's Bank of China. It's true about the European Central Bank. Each of these central banks are basically saying, if you bring your paper money in, we'll record it on the ledger of a commercial bank.

But if Jay Powell were here, he'd have a laugh along with what Alan just said, but he would say, also, the liability is a social liability, as well. That a central banker, to their core, believes what they are trying to do is ensure for the stability of this social thing we call money and to make sure that it doesn't get debased and it has some value. So it's accepted for taxes, we talked about. Notes and coins are legal tender for all debts, public and private. I walk into a Starbucks and I say, I'd like a cup of coffee. Here's my $5 or whatever it costs these days. Does the person behind the counter have to brew the coffee? Is just a yes or no? Can I see? Who wants to go for it? There's a no from Christopher. What, Chris? There's a no from Chris. Who agrees with Chris? OK. They brew a cup of coffee. I go to the other side of the counter. The coffee's sitting there. Now, do they have to accept my $5 at that point? Yes. Before they brew the coffee, nobody has to take dollars. But once a debt is established, they've produced the good, they've provided the service, they have to take it. Just a small, little thing. That's what legal tender is. And so there's many establishments around the globe that are basically now putting little signs out, we don't take Swedish krona. We don't take this. We don't take that in paper form. They'll still take it electronically. And there's a new little bit of definitional thing going on about legal tender. There's also some unique tax treatments, but I'm not going to go through the currency. So central banking and money we talked about a little bit. This is a kind of chart that I borrowed from somebody else's paper. But the central banks at the top is at the center. And if Alice and Bob-- and we'll be talking about Alice and Bob in Bitcoin time, so you can pull this chart down later-- want to transact and they're at the same commercial bank, Bank Number 1, then commercial Bank Number 1 has to change their ledgers, moving money from Alice to Bob. In essence, if you're both two people at Bank of America, you can move your balance at Bank of America. But if you're at Bank of America going over to Citicorp, then something has to go between two ledgers, Bank of America's ledger and Citicorp's ledger. And the only way to transact between two banks' ledgers is some balancing act has to happen at the top ledger, called the central bank. And later, when we talk about payment systems-- and I'm going to use this slide again later in the semester. That's why I'm not going to spend as much time now on it. We're going to talk about ledgers. And when you move money between two banks, it's all within one closed system-- that country's or that society's central banking system. But then it gets really a little bit more iffy and woolly when you're moving from one currency to another currency. Because how do you make two closed ledger systems operable? Not for today, but we'll go through that later when we do payment systems and the like. The central bank, the US central bank-- this was the only good slide I could find, which was about a year old. Its liabilities and assets are about 4 and 1/4 trillion dollars, $4.3 trillion. $1.7 trillion of that is in currency. Do I get my $1 back, by the way? I mean, my liability. So $1.7 trillion of those greenbacks are in circulation. And remarkably, even though half of you probably don't use cash that much, you don't even have checking accounts, the amount of cash in circulation is growing faster than the economy in most developed nations. Why do you think that is? What probably one word? "

Paper currency is a wonderful method of money laundering, drug running, and a store of value. So there's certain segments of our economy and segments of the worldwide economy that does not want to be in the electronic banking system. I'm going to slip through these quickly, but there's another piece that we need for this whole class and for the semester is credit and credit intermediation. But just a little thing-- credit cards started only 60 or 70 years ago, but they go back to a book a little over 100 years ago. The word \"credit card\" is used 18 times in this book, where a science fiction writer in 1887 said, what would the world be like in the year 2000? And it was the first use of the word \"credit card.\" And he said that society would have a form of money, and you would have credit against it. And it's a fascinating thing that somebody could be that visionary. But there were merchant cards starting, so maybe he wasn't so visionary. Oil companies in the 1920s, charge cards were starting, but they were single-merchant cards. You could have credit from that merchant. In 1946, in a bank in Brooklyn, a guy named Biggins started with that. That was the first real charge it. You could charge things in a few dozen places in Brooklyn, literally. And then, all of a sudden, it took off. Diner's Club started in the early 1950s. They found that they could get a bunch of restaurants to say, wouldn't you want to extend credit, and we'll back it? American Express in the mid-1950s. And then, finally, in the mid-1960s, Bank of America, which at that time was a California bank, figured out they would create a co-operative with a bunch of other US banks to extend credit. And the credit boom took off. And what was interesting, the laws to regulate all this didn't come until the 1970s, at least in the US-- the Fair Credit Reporting Act and all the other laws. There's three big ones in the 1970s. I go to conferences sometime and talk about Bitcoin regulation, and they say, well, why can't the government solve this now? I sort of remind them that it took 15 to 20 years from the introduction of credit cards kind of in the early to mid 1950s and the real take-off in the 1960s-- it was 1974, 1970, '77, the three big credit laws. So if you're going to be an entrepreneur in Bitcoin, know that it could be 15 years until there's some cryptolaws in the future. That was the processing machine from the 1950s. I made it too small, sorry. Visa made it better. And then, of course, that's what we all see today, how your cards get processed. So the role of money we've talked about. So I'm going to skip over that. But now the characteristics of money. What makes a good money? We talked about some of this earlier. It's durable, meaning that that salt cube wasn't the greatest, because if a lot of rain came, that would wash away. Gold and silver, metals, are durable. They're portable. The heavier it is, the less portable it is, and that's why gold was a better money than silver. You could move it-- and better than copper and bronze. It was divisible easily. You could slice things up. Uniform and fungible. And anyone who's who down the rabbit hole on this stuff, if you really want to learn about money, read about Crawford versus Royal Bank in 1749. There was a gentleman at the early part of paper money that mailed two 20-pound notes, and he wrote his name on them. They got lost in the mail, and he took the banks to court to say, those were mine, when they were found. And there was no law in Scotland or in England at the time as to what to do about it. But if you lose or somebody stole a piece of art, you get it back. And the law was settled in 1749 that you actually don't get your money back. Does anybody want to guess as to why the courts-- it was a matter of first interpretation. The courts had no jurisprudence on this before 1749. Why did the courts decide that a piece of art was different than currency? And it goes to the fundamental of what money is, fiat money is. Anybody want to take a guess as to why the courts-- they could have gone the other way. "

You can make it a token-- a token is like something physical-- or account based. We're of course now living in a world of account-based money, and it's digital, not physical. It can be issued by the private sector, just like banknotes in the 18th century, or private sector like Bitcoin, or it can be central. It can be widely acceptable or just wholesale. There are forms of wholesale money. One of the biggest forms of wholesale money is the central bank's reserves are only available to the commercial banking system. We're going to study this money flower later, but I put it in the slides because this-- I didn't create this flower. You have a reading later in the semester from the Bank of International Settlement that has this money flower in it. But it's basically across these four things-- is it token our account based, physical or digital, private or central, or widely accessible? And then all monies fall into one piece of this money flower. There's a Professor Garrett that came up with this flower, and there's an optional reading later in the semester from him. You had a reading from Clark. There's not enough time, but all this stuff failed. Does anybody want to give me a flavor for one or two reasons why a bunch of digital cash failed?

                "content": " That's it. Couldn't spend the double spend problem. Could a currency be spent not just once, but twice? So there's four things that were raised. Four things about centralization, the double spend. They couldn't get merchants to adopt it, and there was couldn't-- some form of consensus as to what the ledger was. I'm going to flip through these quickly, but digital and mobile money did happen. We were asked about PayPal earlier. It was 1998. In Norway, Ericsson and Telenor had the first mobile app. And it was to get movies on your mobile phone. 1999, Alipay comes along that we'll talk a lot about when we do payments later. And of course, M-Pesa that we talked about a little last week in Kenya, where Safaricom noticed that a bunch of money-- near money. It was mobile minutes that was being used as money in Kenya, and now there's 20 million users of that. And of course, there's a bunch of regulations now and so forth. Starbucks started in 2011. And then, of course, it's now off to the races in mobile money. One of the key things about mobile money we will discuss and learn together is the question each one of these is, where is the stored value? And I have to tell you, sometimes I get quite confused when I research a new app. Are they storing the value? Or are they just a processing provider to move-- as we said earlier, payment systems move and change and amend other ledgers. In a number of these, like M-Pesa, initially they were storing the value. And mobile apps Starbucks stores the value. But many of them are just applications, computer code, to move the ledger somewhere else. But the riddle remained. You remember that riddle-- how to move money peer to peer without a central authority. And that's what I'm asking for next class, Thursday, to actually read. I wouldn't wing it, and I wouldn't be afraid of it. Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a paper that everybody in this class-- if you're at MIT, and a few of you are at Harvard. I'm telling you, you can read it. You'll understand maybe 1/2 to 2/3 of it. It's not deeply technical. And it's only eight or nine pages. I've also assigned National Institute of Science Technology, about 20 pages of reading from NIST. The question is whether that's Bitcoin. I'm going to skip through the study questions, but the study questions are really about cryptography and how append-only timestamping. We are going to get into the nitty-gritty over three lectures. I couldn't commit the whole course, the whole semester. But I think three lectures-- Thursday and the two next week. Anytime you want to come to see me-- Sabrina is somewhere here on the floor, who's one of our TAs, who's a computer science master's student and knows more about all of this. Madores, who was here last week-- I don't know if Madores is here, who's part of the Digital Currency Initiative. Over three lectures, we're going to try to work through what's the cryptography, and why does that matter? How does the time stamping happen? How's this look like money, and how are the transactions kept? Yes? You get to close it out, almost. "

They used a cryptographic method called hash functions. And they were just trying to notarize information. And by 1995, they took-- they were entrepreneurs. They created a company called Surety. And once a week, they published, in the New York Times-- and they still do it. You can get a New York Times-- I believe it's on Saturday or Sunday. And they take-- it's in the classifieds section. And they have the hash function, which you'll read about between now and Thursday. They have the hash of all the pre-existing information.
