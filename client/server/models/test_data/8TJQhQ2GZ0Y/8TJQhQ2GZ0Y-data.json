So first of all, I hope you've been enjoying the class so far. And thank you for filling out the survey. So we got some very useful and interesting feedbacks. One of the feedbacks-- this is my impression, I haven't gotten a chance to talk to my co-lecturers or colleagues yet, but I read some comments. You were saying that some of the problem sets are quite hard. The math part may be a bit more difficult than the lecture. So I'm thinking. So this is really the application lecture. And from now, after three more lectures by Choongbum, it will be essentially the remainder is all applications. The original point of having this class is really to show you how math is applied, to show you those cases in different markets, different strategies, and in the real industry.",

Should I give you more math, or should I-- you've had enough math. I mean, it sounded like from the survey you probably had enough math. So I would probably want to focus a bit more on the application side. And from the survey also it seems like most of you enjoyed or wanted to listen to more on the application side. So anyway, as you've already learned from Peter's lecture, the so-called Modern Portfolio Theory. And it's actually not that modern anymore, but we still call it Modern Portfolio Theory. So you probably wonder, in the real world, how actually we use it. Do we follow those steps? Do we do those calculations? And so today, I'd like to share with you my experience on that, both in the past, a different area, and today probably more focused on the buy side. Oh, come on in. Yeah. Actually, these are my colleagues from Harvard Management. So-- [CHUCKLES] --they will be able to ask me really tough questions. So anyway, so how I'm going to start this class. You wondered why I handed out to each of you a page. So does everyone have a blank page by now? Yeah, actually.",

Base it on what you want to do. And so totally free thinking, but I want you to do it in five minutes. So don't overthink it. And hand it back to me, OK? So that's really the first part. I want you to show intuitively how you can construct a portfolio, OK? So what does a portfolio mean? That I have to explain to you.

And then so while you're filling out those pages, please hand it back to me. It's your choice to put your name down or not. And then I will start to assemble those ideas and put them on the blackboard. And sometimes I may come back to ask you a question-- you know, why did you put this? That's OK. Don't feel embarrassed. We're not going to put you on the spot. But the idea is I want to use those examples to show you how we actually connect theory with practice. I remember when I was a college student I learned a lot of different stuff. But I remember one lecture so well, one teacher told me one thing. I still remember vividly well, so I want to pass it on to you. So how do we learn something useful, right? You always start with observation. So that's kind of the physics side. You collect the data. You ask a lot of questions. You try to find the patterns. Then what you do, you build models. You have a theory.",

Sometimes in economics, lot of times, unlike physics, the repeatable patterns are not so obvious. So what you do after this, so you come back to observations again. You confirm your theory, verify your predictions, and find your error. Then this feeds back to this rule. And a lot of times, the verification process is really about understanding special cases. That's why today I really want to illustrate the portfolio theory using a lot of special cases. So can you start to hand back your portfolio construction by now? OK, so just hand back whatever you have. If you have one thing on the paper, that's fine. Or many things on the paper, or you think as a portfolio manager, or you think as a trader, or you think simply as a student, as yourself. All right, so I'm getting these back. I will start to write on the blackboard. And you can finish what you started.",

You just have more spending coming up. So but it goes to a certain point. You will taper down, right? So you're not going to keep going forever. So that's your spending curve. And with the other curve, you think about it. It's what's your income, what's your earnings curve. You don't earn anything where you are just born. I use earning. So this is spending. So let's call this 50. Your earning probably typically peaks around age 50, but it really depends. Then you probably go down, back up. Right, so that's your earning. And do they always match well? They don't. So how do you make up the difference? You hope to have a fund, an investment on the side, which can generate those cash flows to balance your earning",

The other situation is, I want to graduate and pay back all the student loans in one year. So that's another. And typically people have to plan these out. And if I'm managing a university endowment, so I have to think about what the university's operating budget is like, how much money they need every year drawing from this fund. And then by maintaining, protecting the total fund for basically a perpetual purpose, right? Ongoing and keep growing it. You ask for more contributions, but at the same time generating more return. If you have a pension fund, you have to think about what time frame lot of the people, the workers, will retire and will actually draw from the pension. And so every situation is very different. Let me even expand it. So you think, oh, this is all about investment. No, no, this is not just about investment. So I was a trader for a long time at Morgan Stanley, and later on a trading manager.

            "text": " the question I was facing is how much money I need to allocate to each trader to let them trade. How much risk do they take, right? So they said, oh, I have this winning strategy. I can make lots of money. Why don't you give me more limits? No, you're not going to have all the limits. You're not going to have all the capital we can give to you. Right, so I'm going to explain. You have to diversify. At the same time, you have to compare the strategies with parameters-- liquidity, volatility, and many other parameters. And even if you are not managing people, let's say-- I was going to do this, so Dan, [INAUDIBLE], Martin and Andrew. So they start a hedge fund together. So each of them had a great strategy. Dan has five, Andrew has four, so they altogether have 30 strategies. So they raise an amount of money, or they just pool together their savings. But how do you decide which strategy to put more money on day one? So those questions are very practical. So that's all. So you understand your goals, that's then you're really clear on how much risk you can take. So let's come back to that. So what is risk? As Peter explained in his lecture, risk is actually not very well defined. So in the Modern Portfolio Theory, we typically talk about variance or standard deviation",

So what are we trying to do? So this, you are familiar with this chart, right? So return versus standard deviation. Standard deviation is not going to go negative. So we stop at zero. But the return can go below zero. And I'm going to review one formula before I go into it. I think it's useful to review what previously you learned. So you let's say you have-- I will also clarify the notation as well so you don't get confused.

Then the variance-- oh, let's just look at the variance, sigma_P squared. So these are vectors. This is a matrix. The sigma in the middle is a covariance matrix.

So that's here. So let's call this cash. Where is-- and let's me just think about another example. Where's lottery? Say you buy Powerball, right? So where's lottery falling? Let's assume you put everything in lottery. So you're going to lose. So your expected value is very close to lose 100%. And your standard deviation is probably very close to 0. So you will be here. So some of you say, oh, no, no. It's not exactly zero. So OK, fine. So maybe it's somewhere here, OK? So not 100%, but you still have a pretty small deviation from losing all the money. What is coin flipping? So let's say you decide to put all your money to gamble on a fair coin flip, fair coin. So expected return is zero. What is the standard deviation of that? AUDIENCE: 100%? PROFESSOR: Good. So 100%.",

So the return is better than cash with some volatility. Let's call it here. What is investing in a start up venture capital fund like? Pretty up there, right? So you'll probably get a very high return, by you can lose all your money. So probably somewhere here, you see. Buying stocks, let's call it somewhere here. Our last application lecture, you heard about investing in commodities, right? Trading gold, oil. So that has higher volatility, so sometimes high returns. So let's call this commodity. And the ETF is typically lower than single stock volatility, because it's just like index funds. So here. Are there any other choices you'd like to put on this map?",

            "text": " OK. So let me just look at what you came up with. Real estate, OK. Real estate, I would say probably somewhere around here. Private equity probably somewhere here. Or investing in hedge funds somewhere. So I think that's enough examples to cover. So now let me turn the table around and ask you a question. Given this map, how would you like to pick your investments? So you learned about the portfolio theory. As a so-called rational investor, you try to maximize your return. At the same time, minimize your standard deviation, right? I hesitate to use the term \"risk,\" OK? Because as I said, we need to better define it. But let's just say you try to minimize this but maximize this, the vertical axis. OK, so let's just say you try to find the highest possible return for that portfolio with the lowest possible standard deviation. So would you pick this one? Would you pick this one? OK, so eliminate those two. But for this, that's actually all possible, right?",

It's really the possible combinations of those investments you can push out to the boundary that you can no longer find another combination-- given the same standard deviation, you can no longer find a higher return. So you reached the boundary. And the same is true that for the same return, you can no longer minimize your standard deviation by finding another combination. OK, so that's called efficient frontier. How do you find the efficient frontier? That's what essentially those work were done and it got them the Nobel Prize, obviously. It's more than that, but you get the flavor from the previous lectures. So what I'm going to do today is really reduce all of these to the special case of two assets. Now we can really derive a lot of intuition from that.",

So again for that, let's write out for the two assets. So what is R of P? It's w_1 R_1 plus 1 minus w_1 R_2, right? Very simple math. And what is sigma_P? So the standard deviation of the portfolio-- or the variance of that, which is a square-- we know that's for the two asset class special case. So let me give you a further restriction-- which, let's consider if R_1 equal to R_2.",

PROFESSOR: There's no-- yeah, that's right. OK, so let's look at this. So you have sigma_2 here. Sigma_1 is 0. And you have R_1 equal to R_2. What is all R of P? It's R, right?

So you choose either, you will be ending up-- the portfolio exposure in terms of return and variance will be right here. But what if you choose-- so when you try to find the minimum variance, you actually end up-- I'm not going to do the math. You can do it afterwards. You check by yourself, OK? You will find at this point, that's when they are equally weighted, half and half. So you get square root of that. So you actually have a significant reduction of the variance of the portfolio by choosing half and half, zero-ly correlated portfolio. So what's that called? What's that benefit? Diversification, right? When you have less than perfectly correlated, positively correlated assets, you can actually achieve the same return but having a lower standard deviation. I'll say, OK, that's fairly straightforward. So let's look at a few more special cases. I want really to have you establish this intuition. So let's think about what if in the same example,",

OK, this is actually I-- let me just derive very quickly for you. Sigma_1 equal to 0, rho equal to 0. What's sigma_P? Right? And sigma_P is essentially proportional to sigma_2 with the weighting. OK, and what's R? R is a linear combination of R_1 and R_2. So it's still-- so it's linear. OK, so because in these cases, you actually-- you essentially-- your return is a linear function. And the slope, what is the slope of this?",

Because last time we talked about the efficient frontier. That's when we have no riskless assets in the portfolio, right? When you add on cash, then you actually can select. You can combine the cash into the portfolio by having a higher boundary, higher Efficient Frontier, and essentially a higher return with the same exposure. So let's look at a couple more cases, then I will tell you-- so I think let's look at-- so R_1 is less than R_2. And volatilities are not 0. Also, sigma_1 is less than sigma_2, but it has a negative correlation of 1. So you'll have asset one, asset two.",

And what if when rho is equal to 0-- and actually, I want to-- so sigma_1 should be here, OK? So when rho is equal to zero, this no longer goes to-- the variance can no longer be minimized to 0. So this is your efficient frontier, this part. I think that's enough examples of two assets for the efficient frontier. So you get the idea. So then what if we have three assets? So let me just touch upon that very quickly. If you have one more asset here, essentially you can solve the same equations. And when the-- special case: you can verify afterwards, if all the volatilities are equal, and zero correlation among the assets. You're going to be able to minimize sigma_P equal to 1",

But it gives you the idea how to answer your question, how to select them when you start with two. So why are two assets so important? What's the implication in practice? It's actually a very popular combination. Lot of the asset managers, they simply benchmark to bonds versus equity. And then one famous combination is really 60/40. They call it a 60/40 combination. 60% in equity, 40% in bonds. And even nowadays, any fund manager, you have that. People will still ask you to compare your performance with that combination. So the two-asset examples seem to be quite easy and simple, but actually it's a very important one to compare. And that will lead me to get into the risk parity discussion. But before I get to risk parity discussion, I want to review the concept of beta and the Sharpe ratio.",

So Kelly's formula basically gives you that when you have-- let's say in the gambling example, you know your winning probability is p. So this basically tells you how much to size up, how much you want to bet on. So it's a very simple formula. So you have a winning probability of 50/50, how much you bet on? Nothing. So if you have p equal to 100%, you bet 100% of your position. If you have a winning probability of negative 100%, so what does it mean? That means you have a 100% probability of losing it.",

            "text": " this millennium event. So they had to cut interest rates for this event. But actually nothing happened, so everything was OK. But that left the market with plenty of cash, and also after the tech bubble burst. So that was a good portfolio, but then obviously in 2008 when the equity market crashed, the bond market, the government bond hybrid market, had a huge rally. And so that made people question that. Is this 60/40 allocation of asset simply by the market value the optimal way of doing it, even though you are falling on the Efficient Frontier? But how do you compare different points? Is that simple choice of your objectives, your situation, or there's actually other ways to optimize it. So that's where the risk parity concept was really-- the concept has been around, but the term was really coined in 2005, so quite recently, by a guy named Edward Qian. He basically said, OK, instead of allocating 60/40 based on market value, why shouldn't we consider allocating risk? Instead of targeting a return, targeting asset amount-- let's think about a case where we can have equal weighting of risk between the two assets.",

So you have lower return and a lower risk, a lower standard deviation. But sometimes you will really want a higher return, right? How do you satisfy both? Higher return and lower risk. Is there a free lunch? So he was thinking, right? There is, actually. It's not quite free, but it's the closest thing. You've probably heard this phrase many times. The closest thing in investment to a free lunch is diversification. OK, and so he's using a leverage here as well. let me talk about it a bit more, about diversification, give you a couple more examples, OK? That phrase about the free lunch and diversification was actually from-- was that from Markowitz? Or people gave him that term. OK, but anyway. So let me give you another simple example, OK?

So asset B basically goes down to 50% and it goes back up to 100%. So that's when you look at them independently. But what if you had a 50/50 weight of the two assets? So if someone who is quick on math can tell me, what does it change? So A goes up like that, B goes down like that. Now you have a 50/50 A and B. So let's look at magic.

I'll try to leave plenty of time for questions. So that's the return, and so let's forget about these. So let's leave cash here, OK? So the previous example I gave you, when you have two assets, one is cash, R_1, the other is not. The other has a volatility of sigma_2. You have this point, right? So and I said, what's in between?

What if you go beyond that? What does that mean? OK. So let's say, can we have w_1 equal to minus 1, w_2 equal to plus 2? So they still add up to 100%. But what's negative 1 mean? Borrow, right? So you went short cash 100%, you borrow money. You borrow 100% of cash, then put into to buy equity or whatever, risky assets, here. So you have plus 2 minus 1. What does the return looks like when you do this? So R_P equal to w_1 R_1 plus w_2 R_2. So minus R_1 plus 2R_2. That's your return. It's this point here. What's your variance look like, or standard deviation look like?",

So this introduces the concept of leverage. Whenever you go short, you introduce leverage. You actually-- on your balance sheet, you have two times of asset two. You're also short one of the other instrument, right? OK so that's your liability. So your net is still one. So what this risk parity says is, OK, so we can target on the equal risk weighting, which will give you somewhere around-- let's called it 25. 25% bonds, 75%-- 25% equity, 75% of fixed income. Or in other words, 25% of stocks, 75% of bonds. So you have lower return. But if you leverage it up, you actually have higher return, higher expected return, given the same amount of standard deviation.",

So what's the relationship intuitively between beta-- so let's take a look at the 60/40 example. Your portfolio, you have stocks, you have bonds in it. So I'm asking you, what is really the beta of this 60/40 portfolio to the equity market? When equity market, it becomes-- when the portfolio becomes more volatile. Is your beta increasing or decreasing? So you can derive that. I'm going to tell you the result, but I'm not going to do the math here. So beta equals to-- [INAUDIBLE] in this special case, is sigma_P over sigma_2. OK. All right, so so much for all these. I mean, it sounds like everything is nicely solved. And so coming back to the real world, and let me bring you back, OK? So are we all set for portfolio management? We can program, make a robot to do this.",

And it would really perfectly absorb-- you heard about soldiers just marching across a bridge, and they'll crush the bridge. When everybody's walking in sync, your force gets synchronized. Then the bridge was not designed to take that synchronized force, so the bridge collapsed in the past. So when they designed this, they took all that into account. But what they hadn't taken into account was the support of that is actually-- so they allow the horizontal move to take that tension away. But the problem is when everybody's sees more people walking in sync, then the whole bridge starts to swell, right? Then the only way to keep a balance for you standing on the bridge is to walk in sync with other people. So that's a survival instinct. And so I got this-- I mean, that's actually my friend at Fidelity, Ren Cheng. Dr. Ren Cheng brought this up to me. He said, oh, you're doing-- how do you think about the portfolio risk, right?",

So if you're looking for this stationary best way of optimizing your portfolio, chances are everybody else is going to figure out the same thing. And eventually, you end up in the situation and you actually get killed. OK, so that's the thing. What you learned today, what you walk away was this. OK, today is not what I want you to know that all the problems are solved. Right? So you say, oh, the problem's solved. The Nobel Prize was given. So let's just program them. No, you actually-- it's a dynamic situation. You have to. So that makes the problem interesting, right? As a younger generation, you're coming to the field. The excitement is there are still a lot of interesting problems out there unsolved. You can beat the others already in the field. And so that's one takeaway. And what are the takeaways you think by listening to all these? AUDIENCE: Diversification is a free lunch. [CHUCKLES] PROFESSOR: Diversification is a free lunch, yes. Not so free, right, in the end. It's free to a certain extent. But it's something-- you know, it's better",

And so I want you to walk away, to really keep in mind is in the field of finance, and particularly in the quantitative finance, it's not mechanical. It's not like solving physics problems. It's not like you can get everything figured so it becomes predictable, right? So the level of predictability is actually very much linked to a lot of other things. Physics, you solve Newton's equations. You have a controlled environment and you know what you're getting in the outcome. But here, when you participate in the market, you are changing the market. You are adding on other factors into it. So think more from a broader scope kind of view rather than just solve the mathematics. That's why I come back to the original-- if you walk away from this lecture, you'll remember what I said at the very beginning. Solving problems is about observe, collecting data, building models, then verify and observe again. OK, so I'll end right here, so questions.",

Because you have a huge population and no stable equilibrium. Does it have anything to do with game theory, by any chance? PROFESSOR: It has a lot to do with game theory, but not only to game theory. So game theory, you have a pretty well-defined set of rules. Two people play chess against each other. That's where a computer actually can become smarter, right? So in this market situation, you have so many people participating without clearly defined rules. There are some rules, but not always clearly defined. And so it's much more complex than game theory. But it's part of it, yeah. Dan, yeah? AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little bit about why some of the risk parity portfolios that did so poorly in May and June when rates started to rise and what about their portfolio allowed them do that? PROFESSOR: Good question, right. So as you can see here, what the risk parity approach does is essentially to weight more on the lower volatility asset. In this case, the question is, how do you know which asset has low volatility? So you look at historical data, which",

So then when bonds to start to sell off after Bernanke, Fed chairman Bernanke, said he's going to taper quantitative easing. So bonds from a very low high yield, a very low yield level, the yield went much higher, the interest rate went higher. Bonds got sold off. So this portfolio did poorly. So now the question is, does that prove the risk parity approach wrong, or does it prove right? Does the financial crisis of 2008 prove the risk parity approach a superior approach, or does the June/May experience prove this as the less-favored approach? What does it tell us? Think about it. So it really is inconclusive. So you observe, you extrapolate from your historical data. But what you are really doing is you're trying to forecast volatility, forecast return, forecast correlation, all based on historical data. It's like-- a lot of people use that example. It's like driving by looking at the rear view mirror. That's the only thing you look at, right? You don't know what's going on, happening in front of you.",

            "text": " You have another question? AUDIENCE: Given all this new information, do you find that people are still playing similar [INAUDIBLE] strategy with portfolio management? PROFESSOR: Very much true. Why? Right, so you said, people should be smarter than that. It's very difficult to discover new asset classes. It's also very difficult to invent new strategies in which you have a better winning probability. The other risk, the other very interesting phenomenon, is most of the traders and the portfolio managers, the investors, they are career investors-- meaning just like if I'm a baseball coach, I'm hired to coach a baseball team. My performance is really measured against the other teams when I win or lose, right? A portfolio manager or investor is also measured against their peers. So the safest way for them to do is to benchmark to an index, to the herd. So there's very little incentive for them to get out of the crowd, because if they are wrong, they get killed first. They lose their jobs. So the tendency is to stay with the crowd. It's for survival instinct. It's, again, the other example. It's actually the optimal strategy for individual portfolio manager is really to do the same thing",

PROFESSOR: So taking more information, processing information, make a judgment on a more holistic approach. So it's an interesting question. I have to say that computers are beating humans in many different ways. Can a computer ever get to the point actually beating a human in investment? I can't confidently tell you that it's not going to happen. It may happen. So I don't know. Any other questions? Yeah? AUDIENCE: Just to add to that.

But I mean, are you moving forward in your career while you're there? So I think management has a role to play in that as well, not just investment. PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think that's a good point. Yeah. All right, so-- oh, sure. Jesse? AUDIENCE: What is your portfolio breakdown? PROFESSOR: My personal portfolio? Well, I am actually very conservative at this point, because if you look at my curve of those spending and earning curve, I'm basically trying to protect principals rather than try to maximize return at this point. So I would be sliding down more towards this part rather than try to go to this corner, yeah. So I haven't really talked much about risk. What is risk, right? So I talk about volatility or standard deviation. But as we all know that, as Peter mentioned last time as well, there are many other ways to look at risk-- value at risk or half distribution or truncated distribution, or simply maximum loss you can afford to take, right? But looking at standard deviation or volatility",

This is your cumulative return or you dollar amount. So you start from here. If you go flat, then-- does anyone like to have this kind of a performance? Right? Of course, right? This is very nice. You keep going up. You never go down. But what's the volatility of that? The volatility is probably not low, right?

And again, bear in mind all the discussion about the Modern Portfolio Theory is based on one key assumption here. It's about Gaussian distribution, OK? Normal distribution. The two parameters, mean and standard deviation, categorize the distribution. But in reality, you have many other sets of distributions. And so it's a concept still up for a lot of discussion and debate. But I want to leave that with you as well. Yeah? AUDIENCE: Just going back to the same question about what these guys were asking about management and how do they add value, I think the people who added value-- there were some people who added a tremendous amount of value in the financial crisis. And they were doing the same mathematics. But a difference was in their expected return of various assets was different from the entire-- the broad market. So if you can just know what expected return is that, probably that is the only answer to the whole portfolio management debate. PROFESSOR: Yes. If you can forecast expected return, then that's-- yeah,",

Nothing more. PROFESSOR: I disagree on that. That's the only thing. Because given two managers, they have the same expected return, but you can still further differentiate them, right? So that's-- yeah. And that's what all this discussion is about. But yes, expected return will drive lot of these decisions. If you know one manager's good expected return, three years later, he's going to make 150%. You don't really care what's in between, right? You're just going to ride it through. But the problem is you don't know for sure. You will never be sure. AUDIENCE: I'd like to comment on that. PROFESSOR: Sure. AUDIENCE: What [INAUDIBLE] looked at in simplified settings, estimating returns and volatilities. And the problem, the conclusion for the problem, was basically cannot estimate returns very well, even with more data, over a historical period. But you can estimate volatility much better with more data. So there's really an issue of perhaps luck in getting the return estimates right with different managers, which are hard to prove that there was really an expertise behind that. Although with volatility, you can have improved estimates.",

PROFESSOR: Yeah. So that highlights the difficulty of forecasting return, forecasting volatility, forecasting correlation. So risk parity appears to be another elegant way of proposing the optimal strategy but it has the same problems. Yeah? AUDIENCE: Actually, I also wanted to highlight. You mentioned the Kelly criterion, which we haven't covered the theory for that previously. But I encourage people to look into that. It deals with issues of multi-period investments as opposed to single-period investments. And most-- all this classical theory we've been discussing, or that I discuss, covers just a single period analysis, which is an oversimplification of an investment. And when you are investing over multiple periods, the Kelly criterion tells you how to optimally basically bet with your bank roll. And actually there's an excellent book, at least I like it, called Fortune's Formula that talks about-- [? we already ?] said the origins of options theory in finance.",

And there was a rather major discussion between Shannon, a mathematician at MIT, who advocated applying the Kelly criterion, and Paul Samuelson, one of the major economists. PROFESSOR: Also from MIT. AUDIENCE: Also from MIT. And there was a great dispute about how you should do portfolio optimization. PROFESSOR: That's a great book. And a lot of characters in that book actually are from MIT-- and Ed Thorp, for example. And it's really about people trying to find the Holy Grail magic formula-- not really to that extent, but finding something other people haven't figured out. But it's very interesting history. Big names like Shannon, very successful in other fields. In his later part of his career and life really devoted most of his time to studying this problem. You know Shannon, right? Claude Shannon? He's the father of information theory and has a lot to do with the later information age invention of computers and very successful, yeah. So anyway, so we'll end the class right here. No homework for today, OK? So you just need to-- yeah, OK.",
