I don't want to start out saying unpopular things, but we do have a quiz coming up next week on Tuesday. There will not be a lecture next Tuesday, but there will be a quiz. 7:30 to 9:30 Tuesday evening. I will send announcement. There's going to be a couple rooms. Some of you will be in this room. Some of you will have to go to a different room, since this room really can't hold 180 students taking a quiz. All right? So hashing. I'm pretty excited about this lecture, because I think as I was talking with Victor just before this, if there's one thing you want to remember about hashing and you want to go implement a hash table, it's open addressing. It's the simplest way that you can possibly implement a hash table. You can implement a hash table using an array. We've obviously talked about link lists",

Now in order to get open addressing to work, there's no free lunch, right? So you have a simple implementation. It turns out that in order to make open addressing efficient, you have to be a little more careful than if you're using the hash tables with chaining. And we're going to have to make an assumption about uniform hashing. I'll say a little bit more about that. But it's a different assumption from simple uniform hashing that Eric talked about. And we'll state this uniform hashing assumption. And we look at what the performance is of open addressing under this assumption. And this is assumption is going to give us a sense of what good hash functions are for open addressing applications or for open addressing hash tables. And finally we'll talk about cryptographic hashing. This is not really 6006 material, but it's kind of cool material. It has a lot of applications in computer security and cryptography. And so as we'll describe the notion of a cryptographic hash, and we'll talk about a couple of real simple and pervasive applications like password storage",

Be it chaining hash tables or open addressing hash tables. All right? So let's get started and talk about open addressing. This is another approach to dealing with collisions. If you didn't have collisions, obviously an array would work, right? If you could somehow guarantee that there were no collisions. When you have collisions, you have to worry about the chaining and ensuring that you can still find the keys even though you had two keys that collided into the same slot. And we don't want to use chaining. The simplest data structure that we can possibly use are arrays. Back when I was a grad student, I went through and got a PhD writing programs in C, never using any other structure than arrays, because I didn't like pointers. And so open addressing is a way that you can implement hash tables doing exactly this. And in particular, what we're going to do is assume an array structure with items.",

So this is important because we don't have link lists. We can't arbitrarily increase the storage of a slot using a chain, and have n, which is the number of elements, be greater than m, right? Which you could in the link list table with chaining. But here you only have these area locations, these indices that you can put items into. So it's pretty much guaranteed that if you want a working open addressing hash table that m, which is the number of slots in the table, should be greater than or equal to the number of elements, all right? That's important. Now how does this work. Well, we're going to have this notion of probing. And the notion of probing is that we're going to try to see if we can insert something into this hash table, and if you fail we're actually going to recompute a slightly different hash for the key",

So this is an iterative process, and we're going to continually probe until we find an empty slot into which we can insert this key value pair. The key should index into it. So you do have different hashes that are going to be computed based on this probing notion for a given key. All right? And so what we need now is a hash function that's different from the standard hash functions that we've talked about so far, which specifies the order of slots to probe, which is basically to try for a key. And this is going to be true for insert, search, and delete, which are three basic operations. And they're a little bit different, all right? Just like they were different for the chaining hash table, they're different here, but they're kind of more different here. And you'll see what I mean when we go through this. And this is not just for one slot. It's going to specify an order of slots. And so our hash function h is going",

It's going to take the key as an argument, and it's going to take a trial, which is an integer between 0 to n minus 1, all right? And it's going to produce-- just like the chaining hash function it's going to produce a number between 0 and m minus 1, right? Where m is the number of slots in the table. All right. So that's the story. In order to ensure that you are using the hash table corresponding to open addressing properly, what you want is-- and this is an important property-- that h k 1,",

Whatever-- That eventually the sequence of probes is going to be able to allow you to insert into that slot. All right? And we generalize this notion into the uniform hashing assumption in a few minutes, but hopefully this makes sense from a standpoint of really load balancing the table and ensuring that all slots in the table are sort of equal opportunity slots. That you're going to be able to put keys in them as long as you probe long enough that you're going to be able to get there. Now of course the fact that you're using one particular slot for one particular key depends on the order of keys that you're inserting into this table. Again, you'll see that as we go through an example, all right? So that's the set up. That's the open addressing notion. And that as you can see, we're just going to go through a sequence of probes and our hash function is going to tell us what the sequences is, and so we don't need any pointers or anything like that. So let's take a look at how this might work in practice. So maybe the easiest thing to do is to run through an example, and then I'll show you some pseudocode.

In this case, you've gone through three trials in order to find an empty slot. And so the big question really here is other than taking care of search and delete, how long is this process going to take? All right? And I'm talking about that in a few minutes, but let me explain, now that you've seen insert, how search would work, right? Or maybe I get one of you guys to explain to me once you have insert, how would search work? Someone? Someone from the back? No one. You guys are always answering questions. Yeah, all the way in the back. AUDIENCE: Would you just do the same kind of probing [INAUDIBLE] where you find it or you don't find it? PROFESSOR: Right. So you do exactly. It's very similar to insert. You have a situation where you're going to none would indicate an empty slot.",

It's not like delete is much more complicated, but there is a subtlety there. And so that's kind of neat, right? I mean this actually works. So if you had a situation where you were just accumulating keys, and you're looking for the number of distinct elements in the stream of data that was coming in, and that was pretty much it with respect to your program, you'd never have to delete keys, and this would be all that you'd have to implement. Right? But let's talk about delete. Every once in awhile we'd want to delete a key? Yeah, you had a question? AUDIENCE: I have a question about search. Why do you stop searching once you find an empty slot? PROFESSOR: Because you're searching. So what that means is that you're looking to see if this key were already in the table. And if key were already in the table, you want to return the value associated with that key. If you find an empty slot, since you're using the same deterministic sequence of probes that you would have if you had inserted it, then-- that make sense? Good. All right. So so far so good? That's what works for insert and search.",

Let's just say I replace it with none. Now what happens is that when I search for 496, according to this search algorithm what am I going to get? AUDIENCE: None. PROFESSOR: Well the first slot I'm going to look at is 1, and according to this search algorithm, I find an empty slot, right? And when I find an empty slot, I'm going to say I failed in the search. If you encounter k, you succeed and return the key value pair, right? Success means you return the value. And if you encounter an empty slot, it means that you've decided that this key is not in the table. And you say couldn't find it, right? That make sense? So this is obviously wrong, right?

We're now going to have to do a couple of different things for insert and search, OK?

And we're going to say that when I delete something, replace deleted item with not the non flag, but a different flag that we'll call delete me. Is different from none.

So in particular, what you would do is you'd have to modify this slightly, because the notion of an empty slot means that you're looking for none, right? And all it means is that-- well actually in some sense, the pseudo code doesn't really change because if you say you either encounter k or you would-- even if you encounter a delete me, you keep going. All right? That's the important thing. So I guess it does change, because I assume that you have only two cases here, but what you really have now are three cases. The three cases are when you're doing the search is that you encounter the key, which is the easy case. You return it. You return the value. Or you can encounter a delete me flag, in which case you keep going. OK? And if you encounter an empty slot, which corresponds to none, at that point you know you failed and the key doesn't exist in the table. All right? So let me just write that out. Insert treats delete me the same as none.",

Well, going through exactly the same example, we started from here, and then we decided to delete 586. And so if we replaced 586 not with none, but with delete me, and the next time around when you search for 496, you're searching for 496. And what would happen is that you would go look at 586-- the slot that contained 586, and you see that there's a delete me flag in there. And so you go to the next trial. And then in the next trial, you discover that, in this case, you have-- I'm sorry. I had 204 first as the first trial, and then in the second trial I had 586. And I would continue beyond the second trial and get to third trial, and in fact return 496 in this case.",

I mean the whole point of deleting is that you can take the storage and insert other keys in there. Once you've freed up the storage. And you can do that by making insert treat delete me the same as the none. So the next time you want to insert you could-- if you happen to index into the index corresponding to 586, you can override that. The delete me flag goes away, and some other key-- call it 999 or something-- would get in there. And you're all set with that. OK? Any questions? This all makes sense? So you could imagine coding this up with an array structure is fairly straightforward. What remains here to be discussed is how well does this work, right? You have this extra requirement on the hash function corresponding to creating an extra argument as an input to it, which is this trial count. And you'd like to have this nice property of corresponding to a permutation. Can we actually design hash functions like this?",

So let's talk about probing strategies, which is essentially the same as taking a hash function and changing it so it is actually applicable to open addressing. So the notion of linear probing is that you do h k i equals h prime k, which is some hash function that you've chosen, plus i mod m, where this is an ordinary hash function. OK? So that looks pretty straightforward. What happens here? Does this satisfy the permutation argument? Before I forget. Does it satisfy the permutation property that I want h k 1, h k 2, h k m minus 1 to be a permutation? That make sense? Yep, yep. Because I then I start adding. The mod is precisely kind of this round robin cycle, so it's going to satisfy the permutation. That's good.",

AUDIENCE: The fact that [INAUDIBLE] keys, which they're all filled, then if you hit anywhere in here [INAUDIBLE] list of consecutive keys. AUDIENCE: Right. That's excellent. Excellent, excellent answer. So this notion of clustering is basically what's wrong with this probing strategy. And in fact, I'm not going to do this particular analysis, but I'll give you a sense of why the statement I'm going to make is true. But the notion of clustering is that you start getting consecutive groups of occupied slots, OK? Which keep growing. And so these clusters get longer and longer. And if you have a big cluster, it's more likely to grow bigger, right? Which is bad. This is exactly the wrong thing for load balancing, right? And clustering is the reverse of load balancing, right? If you have a bunch of clumps and you have a bunch of empty space in your table, that's bad. Right? The problem with linear probing is that once you start getting a cluster, given the, let's say, the randomness in the hash function, and h prime k",

Well, if you have 100 slots and you have a cluster of size 4, well there's a for 4/100 chance, which is obviously four times greater than 1/100, even I can do that, to go into those four slots. And if you going into those four slots you're going to keep going down to the bottom, and you're going to make that a cluster of size five, right? So that's the problem the linear probing, and you can essentially argue through making some probabilistic assumptions that if, in fact, you use linear probing that you lose your average constant time look up in your hash table for most load factors. So what's happening out here pictorially really is that you have a table and let's say you have a cluster. And this is your cluster. So if your h k 1-- it doesn't really matter what it is-- but h k i maps to this cluster, then you're going to-- linear probing says that the next thing you're going to try is if you map to 42 in the cluster, the next thing you're going to try is 43, 44, until you get maybe to this slot here, which is 57,",

And oh, by the way, at the end of this you just increased your cluster length by one. All right? So it doesn't really work. And in fact, under reasonable probabilistic assumptions in terms of what your hash functions are, you can say that when you have alpha, which is essentially your load factor, which is n over m less than 0.99, you see clusters of size log n, OK? Right. So this is a probabilistic argument, and you're assuming that you have a hash function that's a pretty good hash function. So h prime k can be this perfect hash function, all right? So there's a problem here beyond the choice of h prime k, which is this hash function that worked really well for chaining. All right? And the problem here is the linear probing aspect of it. So what does that mean? If you have clusters of theta log n, then your search and your insert are not going to be constant time anymore. Right? Which is bad in a probabilistic sense.",

And so the notion of double hashing is that you have h k i equals h1 k plus i h2 k mod m. And h1 and h2 are just ordinary hash functions. OK? Now the first thing that we need to do is figure out how we can guarantee a permutation, right? Because we still have that requirement, and it was OK for the linear probing part, but you still have this requirement that you need a permutation. And so those of you who are into number theory, can you tell me what property, what neat property of h2 and m can we ask for to guarantee a permutation? Do you have a question?",

So I figured some of you knew the answer, but I've seen you before. Right. Exactly right. Relatively prime. Just hand it to Victor. So h2 k and m being relatively prime, if that implies a permutation. It's similar to what we had before. You're multiplying this by i. i keeps increasing, and you're going to roll around. All right? I mean you could do a proof of it, but I'm not going to bother. The important thing here is that you can now do something as simple as m equals 2 raised to r, and h2 k for all k is odd, and now you're in great shape. You can have your array to be 2 raised to something, which is what you really want. And you just use h2 k. You could even take a regular hash function and truncate it to make sure it's odd. You can do a bunch of things. There's hash functions that produce odd values, and you can use that. All right? And so double hashing works fairly well in practice. It's a good way of getting open addressing to work.",

And I'm not going to actually do a proof, but it'll be in the notes. But I do want to talk about the theorem and the result that the theorem implies, assuming you have the uniform hashing assumption. And let me first say that this is not the same as simple uniform happening, which talks about the independence of keys in terms of their mapping to slots. The uniform hashing assumption says that each key is equally likely to have any one of the m factorial permutations-- so we're talking about random permutations here-- as its probe sequence.",

But nobody's discovered a perfect hash function, deterministic hash function that satisfies this property. At least not that I know off. So what does this imply? Assuming that you have this and double hatching gives you this property, to a large extent what this means is that if alpha is n over m, you can show that the cost of operations such as search, insert, delete, et cetera. And in particular we talk about insert is less than or equal to 1 divided by 1 minus alpha. OK? So obviously this goes as alpha tends to 1. As alpha tends to 1, the load factor in the table gets large, and the number of expected probes that you need to do when you get an insert grows. And if alpha is 0.99, you're going, on average, require 100 probes. It's a constant number, but it's a pretty bad constant. Right? So you really want alpha to be fairly small.",

Remember this is an average case we're talking about. All of this is using a probabilistic assumption. But as you get to high alphas, suddenly by the time you get to 0.7, open addressing doesn't work well in relation to an equivalent table with the overall number of slots that correspond to a changing table, OK? So open addressing is easy to implement. It uses less memory because you don't need pointers. But you better be careful that your alpha stays around 0.5 and no more. So all that means is you can still use it. You just have to re-size your table. You have slightly different strategies for resizing your table when you use open addressing as opposed to chaining hash tables. All right? So that's a summary of open addressing. I want to spend some time on cryptographic hashes in the time that I have left. I guess I have a few minutes left. But any questions about open addressing? Yep? AUDIENCE: On this delete part, what's going to happen if, say, you fill the table up and then delete everything, and then you start searching. Isn't that going to be bad because it's going to search through everything? PROFESSOR: So that's right. The bad thing about open addressing",

            "text": " is that delete isn't instantaneous, right? In the sense that if you deleted something from the link list in your chaining table, then even if you went to that same thing, the chain got smaller, and that helps you, because your table now has lower load. But there's a delay associated with load when you have the delete me flag. OK? So in some sense the alpha that you want to think about, you should be careful as to how you define alpha. And that's one of the reasons why when you get alpha being 0.5, 0.6 you get into trouble, because if you have all these delete me flags, they're still hurting you. AUDIENCE: And when you resize do those delete me flags get deleted? PROFESSOR: When you completely resize and you redo the whole thing, then you can clean up the delete me's and turn them into nones because you're rehashing it. All right. So yeah, back there. Question? AUDIENCE: Yes, can you explain how you got the equation that the cost of operation insert is less than or equal to 1 over [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: That's a longish proof, but let me explain to you how that comes out. Basically the intuition behind the proof is that we're going to assume some probability p. And initially you're going to say something like if the table, your p-- I'll just write this out here-- is m minus n divided by m.",

So the probability that my very first trial is going to succeed is going to be m minus n divided by m, because these are the number of empty slots. And assuming my permutation argument, I could go into one of them. And so that's what I have here. And if you look at what this is, this is 1 minus alpha, OK? And so then you run off and you remember 6041 or the high school probability course that you take, and you say generally speaking, you're going to be no worse than p for every trial. And so if you assume the worst and say every trial has a probability of success of p, the expected number of trials is 1/p, OK? And that's how you got the 1 over 1 minus alpha. So you'll see that written in gory detail in the notes. All right? OK. Expected to have a little more time in terms of talking about cryptographic hashes, but cryptographic hashes are not going to be on the quiz. This is purely material FYI. For your interest only. And again I have some notes on it, but I want to give you a sense of the other kinds of hashes that exist in the world, I guess.",

So let's talk about an example that is near and dear to every security person's heart and probably to people who aren't interested in security as well, which is password storage. So think about how, let's say, Unix systems work when you type in your password. You're typing in your password [INAUDIBLE], and this is true for other systems as well, but you have a password. And my password is a permutation of my first daughters first name. [LAUGHTER] Yeah, but haven't given it away, right? Haven't given it away. And so this password is something that I'm typing in every day, right? Now the sum check that needs to happen to ensure that I'm typing in the right password. So what is a dumb way of doing things. What's a dumb way of building systems? AUDIENCE: Storing [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: This is kind of a freebie. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: In situ hashing. That's better. So you'd store it.",

And you could make it read for the work, right? And that'd be great, and people do that, right? But what you would rather do is you want to make sure that even the sysadmin doesn't know my password or your password, right? So how do you do that? Well you do that using a cryptographic hash that has this interesting property that is one way, OK? And what that means is that given h of x-- OK, this is the value of the hash-- it is very hard to find the x such that x basically hashes to this value. So if h of x equals let's call it q, then you're only given h of x. And so what do you do now? Well, it's beautiful. Assuming you have this one way hash, this cryptographic hash, in your etc slash password file, you have something like login name, [INAUDIBLE],",

So when I log in and I type in the actual password, what does the system do? What does the system do? It hashes it. It takes x prime, which is the typed in password, which may or may not be equal to my password, because somebody else might be trying to break in, or I just mistyped, or forgot my daughter's first name, which would be bad. And it will just check to see-- it doesn't need x, because it's stored h of x in the system, so it doesn't need x. So if we just compare against what I typed in, it would compute the hash again. And then would let me in assuming that these things matched and would not let me in if it didn't. So now we can talk about-- and I don't have time for this, but you can certainly read up on it on Wikipedia and a bunch in the notes. You can talk about what properties should this hash function have, namely one way collision resistance, in order to solve these problems and other problems. I'm happy to stick around and answer questions.",
