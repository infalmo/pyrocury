Some of you maybe want to keep your laptops open to work on other courses' midterms, but I will ask you to try to focus on Blockchain and Money today. Today, we're going to chat about permissioned versus permissionless systems. I want to thank-- I have a guest here. I call out guest when they're here and I know them. Mark Snyderman, who runs a fund at Fidelity-- Mark runs a 6-- about $6 billion? Called the Real Estate Income Fund at Fidelity. And you might say, well, why does he want to come to a Blockchain and Money course? It's because we went to high school together. [LAUGHTER] So-- and I was at his wedding. And he's getting married again next week. Yeah. [APPLAUSE] But you can all inundate Mark later about Fidelity, because he's been there for a lot of years. See what I'm going to do? I'm shamelessly for MIT and MIT students. So let's get going. I was letting a little bit of time for a few more people to wander in. Today, we're going to talk-- of course, we're going to chat a little bit about the readings and study questions. Going to go back again to, what are the technical and commercial challenges? And this is relative-- this is relevant for all of our lectures, but it's particularly relevant today, because we're going to be talking about two different database structures. One's the permissionless blockchain of Bitcoin. But now, today, we're going to introduce and go deeper into the permissioned, or private, set of blockchains, like the IBM Hyperledger and Corda. But the technical issues relate to all of that. And then, of course, we're going to talk about that against a third type of database-- traditional databases. So aligning permissionless, like Bitcoin, permissioned-- IBM Hyperledger type of-- and then traditional databases, and why, in a business setting, you might think of one versus another versus another. And I'm sure if I run off the rails anywhere on traditional databases, which I have not personally studied, Alon will help bail me out somewhere. Is that a deal? Maybe? "

I can light them up, as some people said, because Toledo's given me my list. But again, class participation-- anybody who hasn't spoken yet might want to sort of chime in and give it a shot.

And now, so we're back to basics again. What is a blockchain? I know we've spent four or five lectures on it, but these key components-- let's start. Append-only timestamped logs. Are they both-- by show of hands, are they in permissionless blockchains? I hope every single hand goes up. Are they in permissioned or closed blockchains? I'm watching. I'm not-- I'm just going to watch. All right. Every hand should go up.

But if it's just the Australian Stock Exchange, and it's one node, or three nodes, couldn't they just change it on all three? And I think, in essence, yes. I mean, that may not be what the database structure is, but I still think it's potentially yes. So as you get more concentration, you have more chance. But Brotish, I will try to research the Corda thing more specifically. Other thoughts? So then you create an auditable database-- some database with cryptography. Hash functions, which half the class said they understood and the other half was sort of, you know, a little rough on, all is in permissioned systems, using cryptographic schemes to ensure for the validity of the data and, so to speak, the immutable nature of the data. What's different is consensus protocols. In essence, it all goes down, except for Brotish's point, maybe, about Corda, as to who gets the chance to add the additional data. Is it a small club deal, or is it broad, wide open? Everybody together, roughly? So back to the technical features. Remember, it's a bunch of cryptography. Love it or hate it, it actually allows us all to use the internet-- well past, obviously, the blockchain that we're discussing in this class. Network consensus, and then all the ledgers. So both permissioned and permissionless have ledgers, have cryptography. It's that middle bucket that's different between the two. So what were some of the challenges that we talked about in blockchain? We just talked about them 10 minutes ago, which is, what's the list again? See, this is the easy part. If you haven't spoken yet, this is, like, the easy questions. Oh, I'm hopelessly shameless. Yes. Do you want to say your first name so Toledo takes you off the list? "

And then on the opposite side, the solution-- the salvation-- was two people in a room trusting each other that the central bank-- that the government would fund tens of billions of dollars [INAUDIBLE] capital. And so I wonder your thoughts on blockchain's role in addressing that first problem of knowing your counterparty, or at least being able to trust their position, and then the risk of eliminating the second chance of injection of capital into the financial system in a blockchain.

I think that what many central bankers and the Financial Stability Board would say, at 200 billion versus 300 trillion, it's probably not that financially relevant at this point. Where it could get relevant is, as Russ has sort of suggested, is if there's leverage behind it. If it's in a balance sheet, it's an asset on a balance sheet, and there's a liability on the other side. And thus it could bring down that entity, whether it's a hedge fund, whether it's a bank. But something that's relying [INAUDIBLE] to tie it back to the questions that Tom raised is, could blockchain lower systemic risk? Possibly, if it's a better database solution. If it answers-- what Mervyn King was speaking about, we also addressed in the late 90s. I remember quite well when Secretary Rubin called a number of us into his office and said, I don't understand. The banks can't tell us their exposure to Korea. A number of countries-- South Korea was about to have-- but they didn't default on their debt, but they were coming close to defaulting on their debt. And of course, it was only a short while before other countries, like Indonesia and Thailand, were getting into that same debt challenge. But why couldn't banks tell the US Department of Treasury their exposure? It's usually through derivatives. And derivatives, both in the late '90s and the financial crisis, were often something that propagated risk through the system. Now, the numbers were larger-- I mean, depending upon the time. The '90s was less than this. But it was $300, $400 trillion of notional amount of derivatives. So just the sheer notional size, even though the capital at risk in derivatives was much smaller because the leverage of this notional-- big, notional size. And the transparency was pretty low. It wasn't zero, actually. It wasn't zero. But it was really low. And so I think that's what Mervyn King would have been mentioning. And I do think blockchain can help in that transparency. But it takes a big collective action. And so Europe, the US, and Asia-- a lot of laws were passed to get more transparency in the derivatives space. Brotish, I would say that there could be problems. And I've had conversations with elected leaders that say, don't get lulled into the sense that it won't have financial stability issues. Because that was what happened in the 1980s and '90s when people said, well, derivatives will not create instability, because it's only the institutional investors, the sophisticated investors-- the so to speak big boys or big girls, you know? And I was part of those debates, that consensus that formed that it was only institutional and it wouldn't-- but there was a lot of leverage and a lack of transparency when big leverage-- multiple hundreds of trillions of dollars-- associated with it, of course, was part of the crisis-- not the only part of the crisis. But any other questions before Hugo? "

On the protecting the investing public front, I was just wondering, like, a lot of people are now using Robinhood and zero fee things like that to invest in the stock market. And companies like Robinhood and Vanguard often sell order book data to high frequency traders so that they can kind of know what's going on and maybe front run. So I was wondering how that fits into what we were talking about last time where there's no transparency on many of the cryptocurrency exchanges. And then in addition to that, big institutional investors can, I think, buy upwards of 5% of any stock and then wait a few days before they have to report on that. So that can also have a huge effect on stock price. And then they can, afterwards, dump on people. So how is that different from what's going on in cryptocurrency exchanges? "

                "content": " All right. Can I hold it? Let me just answer Hugo's investor protection one. So all markets-- not just crypto markets-- all markets are susceptible to some forms of front running. In essence, if you have a client relationship and you get information from your client that might affect the market pricing, you might jump ahead of that client with their information. Their information might be a buy order, a sell order. Or frankly, it might be some other information. But traditionally, if they have a buy order or a sell order, you have information. And then you're sort of jumping ahead and saying, all right. I'll buy or sell in front of them. That's the classic sort of front running, even though there's other methods. It's not supposed to happen. On regulated exchanges, you have some policing of it. Even before governments stood in, you could have some policing of it in self-regulatory organizations. In the crypto world, there is Katy bar the door. Anything can really happen. And it's my belief and understanding that many crypto exchanges-- not all of them. Not all of them. But many crypto exchanges are basically trading in front of their customers. And in fact, most crypto exchanges make markets, as they are both market makers-- meaning they are buying when you're selling and selling when you're buying. That's the nature of a market maker. It's very typical, very legal, very important function of market. But the exchanges are both market makers, and then they show order books. And so it sort of helps them do front running. Not that a lot of people necessarily agree with me, I think these markets would be better off if there were some forms of rules about front running and manipulation in markets and the like. On your 5% question, can we take it up in office hours or something? Because it's sort of outside of crypto. But I would be glad to talk about the SEC rules about the 5%. Is this investor protection?

I'm not going to say it's perfect, but they have very good timestamping to ensure when are orders-- basically message timestamping every message that comes in. And some order books, like the New York Stock Exchange-- some order books are price and time priority, price priority meaning high bid gets hit before the next bid, or lowest offer gets lifted first. That's price priority. But they might also have time priority for any bid that has the same price and any offer that's the same price. So they have to have very good timestamping. I truly believe you could not use a blockchain solution for the New York Stock Exchange order book right now. Whether you can in 10 years, I'm not sure. But time latency is so relevant in the middle of those order books-- you know, the nanoseconds that matter. I'm going to take this stability question.

You can also maybe have higher walls or better moats, but you still know of something to attack. So blockchain, in its decentralized nature, might be a more resilient database, because even if half or two thirds of it goes down, you still have the other third. I'm going to say something about the New York Stock Exchange again. Whether it's the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, they all are required by their various local laws to have backup data centers. And those backup data centers even have to be lots of miles away if, God forbid, a bomb comes and takes out the center. "

And I would say, we have a lot of history with this. Whether it was railroads, or the telegraph, or the telephone, or television, we have a lot of history. Technology and commercial applications move ahead of the public sector. I mean, it's just inevitable. The official sector, the public sector-- unless it just basically does what Mark Carney says, and the choice is to isolate something, to sort of put up the moats of a society and says, we can't use that technology here. Unless you have that, technology usually supersedes the markets, and the markets and technology come before official sector. Depending upon the area, it can take single digit years and sometimes decades for public sector to catch up, literally. But let's take the internet. The internet was being worked on for 15ish years. But the protocol layer that helped take off was the worldwide web in 1991 or '92, and then the security protocols in '96. Just taking financial regulation, the SEC was asked in 1995, could bulletin boards-- there were electronic bulletin boards listing stocks and bonds-- be exempted from being considered stock exchanges? Well, the people that were asking that were the people putting up the bulletin boards. They didn't want to be regulated. The New York Stock Exchange that was fully regulated, and NASDAQ that was fully regulated, was coming at the other side and asking the SEC to shut them down. They didn't want the competition from the disruptors. It took three years for the SEC to answer that question. I don't mean answer it, like, with a letter. They had to propose a rule, and they had to do a final rule, and it was three years to do that. And blockchain, I think, we are through some of the big questions. We know how most jurisdictions tax-- T-A-X-- tax it as property and not as currency, and some of the tax issues. We know, in most jurisdictions, how it fits into, broadly, Bank Secrecy Act and illicit activity. There's very choppy implementation, very spotty implementation. I would say the investor protection side, we're at the early stages. And it's going to take, in most jurisdictions, another three years, maybe, to sort through some of how-- and this is just crypto finance. I don't know. Matt, does that-- I'm giving you some predictions. Some of it could be multiple decades. We're still, today, trying to figure out-- the public sector's figuring out how to regulate Facebook and Google. I'm going to take one last question, because I've got to do permissioned. "

                "content": " So Matt's raising there's a trade-off about bringing something under regulation or into the public policy sphere. I'm probably just one voice of this, but I think it's probably true. There's very few economic activities that grow large that stay fully outside of the public policy framework of a society. It doesn't mean that public policy frameworks don't change, get adopted, get adapted. The internet comes along, and at first, it's a question of-- you know, with Amazon, is it going to be taxed or not? Is there sales tax? And then later-- you know, at first, it's not. Later, it is. And in some jurisdictions, questions on the internet was liability. And this was a very critical question of early internet was, was there liability for any of the information or the flow of information? I'm talking about libel laws and all the liability issues and so forth. And so in the US, there's a section of the law in 1996 was passed. And now we're coming back and saying, wait a minute. That gave too broad-- it basically exempted the internet from liability as carriers. But now, that was modified in 2018-- 22 years later-- to say, well, if it has to do, I think, with basically children trafficking and slavery and everything, maybe we should tighten that up a little bit. So I don't believe any broad economic activity is going to remain fully outside public policy frameworks. And I'm glad to be challenged on that. And I think blockchain, and particularly crypto finance, is at this grappling stage to get in. So let me move forward, because this is more about permissioned and permissionless. I just wanted to cover some of these. We will cover initial coin offerings and the public policy issues around initial coin offerings in the Howey Test. We will cover crypto exchanges, and we will cover central bank digital currencies a lot in the second half of this semester. So back to the trade-offs that we talked about already-- the trade-offs of centralization and decentralizations and Coase's work from the 1930s about the firm. This is the cost, remember. This is the cost. As we get centralized, there's more cost of economic rents, single points of failure, and capture. Some fragility, in a sense, in the system. But decentralization has its cost as well. You'll notice that these two lines are crossing somewhere. It was my failed attempt to say, you know, maybe there's a balance. Maybe overall, while some organizations will find all the way to decentralization, and some to centralization, I think economic systems tend more towards the centralized side of things. But you can change the slope of these two lines if you want. I'm just trying to give you a framework of thinking about it. So as we've talked about, the financial sector pretty much favors permissioned systems. The financial sector is saying, going back, no. Too many costs of coordination, governance, security, privacy, and scalability. We're over in the other side. And so that's where they are today. I'm not sure that's where they'll be in five or 10 years, but it is definitely where they are today. So let's go back down our list, in a sense. I'm going to have a bunch of check marks and x's on the right. Where do you think I'm going to have check marks and x's? This is the same three big buckets, because I can't think of anything. Emily, do you have a point of view? "

But they're not necessarily relevant to every traditional database, which we'll talk about in 10 minutes or so. But as Emily said, there's really not-- I said, no. There's not decentralized network consensus. I'm stretching it a little bit, because permissioned systems can be decentralized. There could be five or 10 or 20 nodes. And so that is decentralized. So I shouldn't have really said no. I should have said maybe, or hybrid. And instead of proof of work, the permissioned systems use a bunch of consensus mechanisms. And I just listed a couple notary nodes or PBFT for Byzantine Fault Tolerance again. But they don't have native currencies. So that is a very big difference-- no native currency. If you have a solution for your final projects, or you have a solution for some entrepreneurial business that you're going to do in the future that you want a native currency, you're probably more over into the permissionless world. You want to have an incentive structure, something to motivate customers or users, or create token economics. Token economics is more in the permissionless. I say more because you can create a token even in the permissioned space. We'll talk about it in a moment. And then transaction script or UTXOs. They're not technically UTXOs in a bunch of permissioned systems, but you need some ledger. This last box, if I just called it ledgers, you'd still have ledgers in. So it's really the consensus mechanism in the middle, as Emily said. A couple of key design features. First, membership's limited to basically an authorized set of nodes. So does anybody want to say, if you were a bank, who you might-- you know, what might you do if you were a bank, and who might you authorize if you're doing a bank-- I don't know. Let's say that it was loans, or if it's Mark Snyderman's real estate. It's real estate loans. Could you ever see real estate loans going on a blockchain, Mark? "

But even if they don't have the same need, they might actually want to put a second layer on top. And some of them actually do this right in their technology. And it's what I put up here as the second and third bullet point. The transactions can be limited to only authorized known participants. So in many permissioned systems, it's a one broad technology. It might only be 20 people that can authorize transactions. But now in some transactions, it will only be Anton and May. And in other transactions, it will be Alpha and Amanda. So I might not be able to-- by the way, Alpha might be Goldman Sachs, and Amanda might be Barclays. And then it might make more sense. And Mark might be Fidelity. And I don't know, am I the US Department of Treasury in this one? Mark and I both started out in finance. I just went off to public service later. But so Corda and Hyperledger and many of the private blockchains literally allow for partitioning right in the blockchain. I don't know if you'd need to put a layer 2 on top, because they allow for partitioning and segregated pools of authority inside of the blockchain. I'm sorry? There was a question, I thought. Oh.

And yet, it could be an enormous benefit, because there's something called title insurance. And title insurance trying to clean up the title and making sure that something is free and clear could be recorded in the future. So I'll be a long-term optimist. I don't see this one being solved in the next handful of years-- single digit years-- particularly because of the [INAUDIBLE] collective action issues. I'm sorry.

Right in the technology, you can partition and segregate information. So data and ledgers can be partitioned because transactions can be partitioned. That doesn't mean you can't have a layer 2. I'm just saying there's a lot less need for a layer 2, because they do it in the data structures itself. The consensus is permissioned private protocols. They do have a consensus. Somebody has to agree on the next block. But it's a tight, limited group. It does use cryptography, but often, there's something called a registration authority. The registration authority is helping mask data. So they address privacy two ways. They address privacy because it's a smaller group. They can actually see the whole network. But even within the network, even on the network, they're further addressing privacy that Alpha's and my transaction, Amanda maybe can't even see, even though she's on the network, because it's encrypted.

How is this partitioning different than a layer 2? And it's beyond my knowledge, but I'm going to see if I can get it for you. That's a good-- they're both-- they're good questions. And then smart contracts-- yes, smart contracts can happen on these systems as well as permissionless systems. IBM-- they say they use chaincode. But they say chaincode really could be any language, at least they advertise, and no native currency. So that's kind of the technical-- not deeply technical. It's not like learning hash functions. But yes to cryptography. Well, they partition the ledgers. The consensus is closed loop. Yes, they have smart contracts. But they can even have additional privacy. But it comes at a cost. There's an authority that has to protect something-- a registration authority inside of it. Oh, I forgot. The code is generally open source. It does not have to be open source. Hyperledger is open source, but it doesn't have to be open source. So this was from one of the readings. I'm just putting up that chart that was in the reading. And I just found it helpful. It's a different way. It's not Gensler's way. It's somebody else's way of thinking about Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Corda. I'm only using Hyperledger and Corda because they're two of the biggest private platforms. There are many others. Different programming language-- you might say, from a business point of view, who cares? And to some level, you're probably right. But you're not completely right. I mean, there's probably more that people can write on top of Hyperledger Fabric. They say more developers could work on that than Solidity. Governance-- that's the governance of the system itself. They all can do smart contracts. We've talked about consensus. And the scalability is much harder. Ethereum, remember, almost crashed on CryptoKitties last December. And I shared that story about one initial coin offering was 30% of the Ethereum network on the one day it was closing [INAUDIBLE]. DTCC, in a given day, can do as much as 100 million transactions in a day. That's the Depository Trust Corporation. Ethereum does about a million and a half transactions a day, and Bitcoin, about 400,000 to 500,000 transactions a day. So you know, we've still got a ways to go on this scalability. So what about traditional databases? I think that to talk about permissioned versus permissionless, a lot of people, even some of my colleagues here at MIT, says, well, if you're talking about Hyperledger, Corda, and Fabric and Corda, that's like Oracle. That's just a traditional database. That's not really blockchain. The Bitcoin and blockchain purist would say, if it doesn't have Nakamoto consensus, forget it. It's not a member of the club. That's not how I've chosen to teach that this class, as you know. I think both are relevant, possibly, to business solutions, and it's worthwhile to think of them. But so what separates-- and this is not in the reading, so I'm just going to, you know, kind of-- but what separates it versus a traditional database? Well, back to the basics. Permissioned private blockchains have append-only logs. You're adding-- I know. Thank you, Brotish. But basically, they have append-only logs. Traditional databases-- and I'm at the edge of my knowledge-- you can create. You can read. You can update. You can delete. Again, I'm taking the mainstream traditional databases, or what's called CRUD, if you wish-- C-R-U-D. Whereas these, you always are adding to the database. Two, these databases use cryptography to have commitment schemes. You may remember, what is a hash function? It not only compresses data, but it means you're committing to the data. And when you finish The New York Times crossword puzzle, you can actually send it in. And if it's identical to-- and hash it. And if you remember our discussion about The New York Times crossword puzzle, if it's hashed, and the hashes match, voil\u00e1. You solved The New York Times crossword puzzle. So you can have commitment schemes for the data. And it can be distributed. Yes, Joequinn. "

So what Joequinn's saying is in Bitcoin, what protects against that is partly the proof of work, and partly that it takes 10,000, or at least 51% of them, probably, to rewrite the last two days. The economic incentives in Bitcoin is, is why waste all your computer power and electricity and so forth doing that when you may as well just go forward? I think Bitcoin could be susceptible to state actors. I think, you know, if North Korea wanted-- or Russia wanted-- to spend probably single digit billions, but at most maybe 10 billion, they could overwhelm the whole system and bring-- they could do a 51% attack by buying up enough mining equipment, the ASICs, and just bigfooting the whole system. But it's multiple billio-- and there's academic papers on this now. It's single digit billions. A state actor could-- an individual wouldn't want to do it, because you'd crush $110 billion market cap down to [INAUDIBLE].. So that would be kind of unwise. This is a very critical part of what a private blockchain-- to me, economically, what a private blockchain can do and facilitate better than a traditional database. I'm not saying this list is the only list. I'm not even saying this list is completely the right list. This is Gary Gensler's list trying to say, what's the business that separates traditional blockchains? Append-only timestamping. Some cryptography and schemes that makes the data immutable so you can put it in a ledger-- so it's back to ledgers and so forth-- and thus, finality of settlement. Does anybody want to remind the class what settlement means? Anybody? Take a shot. Where's my accountant? Aviva's not here. Oh, please. "

Agricultural products are something of value, whether it's corn, wheat, grapes. It's something of value. And when it moves from one owner to another owner, if you keep that on a ledger, you can record that Amanda has the grapes, and Gary no longer has the grapes. And another thing that blockchains help with is they lower the cost of reconciling multiple databases. We could keep-- as in agriculture-- we can keep separate ledgers, separate databases. The farmers keeping their database. The wholesaler with the grain elevators are keeping their database, and up the supply chain, from the farm, to the grain elevator, to the millers and merchants, all the way to General Mills, all the way to Kroger and the store. Right now, those are multiple databases that, by and large, don't have to communicate. So the question is, will Walmart get to the place where that's a good idea? But I'm just pointing out if you're moving things of value where you want to keep final settlement that you know who owns that thing of value in ledgers, and lastly, if you want to lower any reconciliation-- if you have multiple ledgers and things of value, blockchain, I think, is more valuable.

So this was what we talked about earlier-- Coase's trade-offs of costs. Let me try another one, which is going to be my shot at blockchains and traditional databases. So one is access control. Who has access to the ledger? Who has access, if I might, to the data? Three different types of approaches we talked about-- open permissionless, multiple permissioned, and client server. I'm using the word client server just to say traditional database. You can use another words. But I'm just trying to say three different types of data structures. And to Zan's question, why would you be in one bucket versus another? And I'm saying this. If you're a venture capitalist one day, and somebody comes in to you with a blockchain solution, this is the same thing. Hopefully, you'll make it better. This is just my approach to it. Public blockchain-- do you need, basically, public write capability, that lots of people can write to these ledgers? Do you need that somewhere? Secondly, do you want some peer to peer transaction capability across the distributed ledger? Do you kind of not want any central intermediary? Maybe you don't want the central intermediary because they're slow and sluggish. Maybe you don't want the central intermediary because they have a lot of economic rents. It doesn't matter to me why you want to get rid of the central intermediary. But if you want to get rid of a central intermediary, or lessen their control, or lower their control, raise peer to peer transactions, have a lot of public writing-- oh, and by the way, if you want some token economics, you're probably somewhere over here. I'm not saying you have to have all four. But to me, those are the kind of three or four things that are floating around why you might be over there. Private blockchains-- well, maybe you actually don't want public write capability. You need private. Whether it's just the Australian Stock Exchange or 15 to 20 club deal, you still want kind of multiple people to write, but you want it to be private. But if you still need finality of data and an append-only log, that you need this appending-- the log, and you need some public verifiability, that you still need that data to be verified amongst-- and this public means 15 or 20 players. But you need it to be able to be verified-- so the trust mechanism is not thousands and open. The trust mechanism is 15 or 20 or 5 parties. But you still need it-- you might be there. Where I come out is there's some cases that you just don't need any of this. There's a trusted party that hosts the data. Your trust mechanism is one party. The trusted party can do the-- I use the letters CRUD. That's the create, and update, and delete, and so forth. And that's based on client service architecture, this client server architecture. There's always, in that circumstance, somebody right in the middle that basically owns, updates, governs that whole architecture. My business judgment on this is if you're moving things of value, you want those things to value to have some final settlement and immutability. And immutability append-only logs give you some of that final settlement. We talked very briefly about a lawsuit that was 300 plus years ago-- the Crawford case in Scotland that you won't have to remember. But this-- watch this. So steal this from me. Just do me a favor. Just steal it. OK. Right now, I have a right of action. But if you give it to-- who are you going to give it to? I don't have any rights against you. No. Well, wait. It depends whether he knew you stole it from me. But it's gone. That's final settlement. Those $2 are gone. That's final settlement. It's immutable. I can't get them back. What, Christopher? You want them? "

But if you think of it in terms of ledgers-- look, the money's gone. I can't get it. That's it, you know? That's good. You all go to Sloan, I can tell. Yeah, yeah. But it's an important concept. I think of this whole that way. So there were two questions, and then we'll-- and then this is the decentralized end. Bitcoin and Ethereum are kind of at the decentralized end. I would contend Bitcoin's more decentralized than Ethereum. And centralized databases-- initial coin offerings that we'll talk about later, I think, are actually maybe a little bit more centralized, even, than permissioned blockchains. But we'll get to that.

And then we're going to talk about the economics. But I've had three or four groups come in already talking about the final projects. So I'll just say, think about whatever you're working on as this new technology-- blockchain-- whether it's permissioned or permissionless-- either one-- does this new technology really address some pain point that you're trying to solve, whether it's about payment systems or-- actually, there's a group that's talking about doing supply chain on wine. And I figured, why not? I'll probably approve it. But it's, what is the pain point that you're actually trying to solve? Or will decentralized peer to peer networking somehow create a business opportunity in a new model? It might not be a pain point. It might be a business opportunity that decentralized systems solve. Or it might be an opportunity that token economics can help solve. But if there's no pain point you're solving, no token economics, no decentralization peer to peer, I ask you to use your critical reasoning and move to the next use case, because this is really about-- this is a business class. This is about finding places for this incredible set of new technologies in the context of markets and to have a really healthy sense of ground truth about what's possible. If not, traditional databases. Move on. I'm not looking for projects at the end of the semester that are using traditional databases. It's got to really use blockchain. So I thank you. I'll see you next Thursday."
