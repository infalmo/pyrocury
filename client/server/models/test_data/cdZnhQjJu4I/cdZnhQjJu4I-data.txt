It's, again, matrices are square and we're looking now for some special numbers, the eigenvalues, and some special vectors, the eigenvectors. And so this lecture is mostly about what are these numbers, and then the other lectures are about how do we use them, why do we want them. OK, so what's an eigenvector? Maybe I'll start with eigenvector. What's an eigenvector? So I have a matrix A. OK. What does a matrix do? It acts on vectors. It multiplies vectors x. So the way that matrix acts is in goes a vector x and out comes a vector Ax. It's like a function. With a function in calculus, in goes a number x, out comes f(x).",

And the vectors I'm specially interested in are the ones the come out in the same direction that they went in. That won't be typical. Most vectors, Ax is in -- points in some different direction. But there are certain vectors where Ax comes out parallel to x. And those are the eigenvectors. So Ax parallel to x. Those are the eigenvectors. And what do I mean by parallel? Oh, much easier to just state it in an equation. Ax is some multiple -- and everybody calls that multiple lambda -- of x. That's our big equation. We look for special vectors -- and remember most vectors won't be eigenvectors -- that -- for which Ax is in the same direction as x, and by same direction I allow it to be the very opposite direction, I allow lambda to be negative or zero.",

OK. So the question is, how do we find these x-s and lambdas? And notice -- we don't have an equation Ax equal B anymore. I can't use elimination. I've got two unknowns, and in fact they're multiplied together. Lambda and x are both unknowns here. So, we need to, we need a good idea of how to find them. But before I, before I do that, and that's where determinant will come in, can I just give you some matrices? Like here you go. Take the matrix, a projection matrix. OK. So suppose we have a plane and our matrix P is -- what I've called A, now I'm going to call it P for the moment, because it's -- I'm thinking OK, let's look at a then this, this other new matrix, I just have an Ax, projection matrix. What are the eigenvalues of a projection matrix?",

What are the x-s, the eigenvectors, and the lambdas, the eigenvalues, thing,4 but the roots of that quadratic for -- and now let me say a projection matrix. My, my point is that we -- before we get into determinants and, and formulas and all that stuff, let's take some matrices where we know what they do. We know that if we take a vector b, what this matrix does is it projects it down to Pb. So is b an eigenvector in, in that picture? Is that vector b an eigenvector? No. Not so, so b is not an eigenvector c- because Pb, its projection, is in a different direction. So now tell me what vectors are eigenvectors of P? What vectors do get projected in the same direction that they start? So, so answer, tell me some x-s. Do you see what3 so it's if Ax equals lambda x, In this picture, where could I start with a vector b or x, do its projection, and end up in the same direction? Well, that would happen if the vector was right in that plane",

And what will happen when I multiply by P, when I project a vector x -- I called it b here, because this is our familiar picture, but now I'm going to say that b was no good for, for the, for our purposes. I'm interested in a vector x that's actually in the plane, and I project it, and what do I get back? x, of course. Doesn't move. can be complex numbers. So any x in the plane is unchanged by P, and what's that telling me? That's telling me that x is an eigenvector, and it's also telling me what's the eigenvalue, which is -- just compare it with that. The eigenvalue, the multiplier, is just one. Good. So we have actually a whole plane of eigenvectors. Now I ask, are there any other eigenvectors? And I expect the answer to be yes, because I would like to get three, if I'm in three dimensions, I would like to hope for three independent eigenvectors, two of them in the plane and one not in the plane.",

There's an, another good x, because what's the projection? So these are eigenvectors. Another guy here would be another eigenvector. But now here is another one. two. Any x that's perpendicular to the plane, what's Px for that, for that, vector? What's the projection of this guy perpendicular to the plane? It is zero, of course. So -- there's the null space. Px and n- for those guys are zero, or zero x if we like, and the eigenvalue is zero. So my answer to the question is, what are the eigenvalues for In our example, the one we worked out, a projection matrix? There they are. One and zero. OK. We know projection matrices. We can write them down as that A, A transpose, A inverse, A transpose thing, but without doing that from the picture we could see what are the eigenvectors.",

A equals zero one one zero, that had eigenvalue one and Can you tell me a vector x -- see, we'll have a system soon enough, so I, I would like to just do these e- these couple of examples, just to see the picture before we, before we let it all, go into a system where that, matrix isn't anything special. Because it is special. And what, so what vector could I multiply by and end up in the same direction? Can you spot an eigenvector for this guy? That's a matrix that permutes x1 and x2, right? It switches the two components of x. How could the vector with its x2 x1, with -- permuted turn out to be a multiple of x1 x2, the vector we start with? Can you tell me an eigenvector here for this guy? x equal -- what is -- actually, can you tell me one vector that which is lambda x, and I have a three x, And of course you -- everybody knows that they're -- what,",

There, that could be one one, thanks. One one. OK, take that vector one one. That will be an eigenvector, because if I do Ax I get one one. So that's the eigenvalue is one. Great. That's one eigenvalue. But I have here a two by two matrix, and I figure there's going to be a second eigenvalue. And eigenvector. Now, what about that? What's a vector, OK, maybe we can just, like, guess it. A vector that the other -- actually, this one that I'm thinking of is going to be a vector that has eigenvalue minus one. That's going to be my other eigenvalue for this matrix. It's a -- notice the nice positive or not negative matrix, but an eigenvalue is going to come out negative. And can you guess, spot the x that will work for Times x is supposed to give me zero, right? that? So I want a, a vector.

In other words, once I found this eigenvalue of one, I knew the other one had to be minus one in this two by two case, because in the two by two case, which is a good one to, to, play with, the trace tells you right away what the other eigenvalue is. So if I tell you one eigenvalue, you can tell me the other one. We'll, we'll have that -- we'll, minus one and eigenvectors one one and eigenvector minus one we'll see that again. OK. Now can I -- I could give more examples, but maybe it's time to face the, the equation, Ax equal lambda x, and figure how are we going to find x and lambda. And that is lambda one times lambda3 OK.

This matrix must be singular, otherwise the only x would be the zero x, and zero matrix.OK. So this is singular. And what do I now know about singular matrices? So, so take three away. Their determinant is zero. So I've -- so from the fact that that has to be singular, I know that the determinant of A minus lambda I has to be zero. And that, now I've got x out of it. I've got an equation for lambda, that the key equation -- it's called the characteristic equation or the eigenvalue equation. And that -- in other words, I'm now in a position to find lambda first. So -- the idea will be to find lambda first. And actually, I won't find one lambda, I'll find N different lambdas. Well, n lambdas, maybe not n different ones. A lambda could be repeated.",

After I have found this lambda, the lambda being this -- one of the numbers that makes this matrix singular. Their product was eight. Then of course finding x is just by elimination. Right? It's just -- now I've got a singular matrix, I'm looking for the null space. We're experts at finding the null space. You know, you do elimination, you identify the, the, the pivot columns and so on, you're -- and, give values to the free variables. Probably there'll only be one free variable. We'll give it the value one, like there. And we find the other variable. OK. So let's -- find the x second will be a doable job. That's my big equation for x.

It's the matrix A with lambda removed from the diagonal. for this matrix? So the diagonal matrix is shifted, and then I'm taking the determinant. OK. So I multiply this out.

So if I multiply this out, I get lambda squared minus six What's -- how is this matrix related to that matrix? lambda plus what? Plus eight. But it's out there. And that I'm going to set to zero. And I'm going to solve it. So and it's, it's a quadratic equation. I can use factorization, I can use the quadratic formula. I'll get two lambdas. Before I do it, tell me what's that number six that's showing up in this equation? It's the trace. That number six is three plus three. And while we're at it, what's the number eight that's showing up in this equation? It's the determinant. That our matrix has determinant eight. So in a two by two case, it's really nice. It's lambda squared minus the trace times lambda -- the trace is the linear coefficient -- and plus the determinant, the constant term. OK. So let's -- can, can we find the roots?",

If we couldn't factor it, then we'd have to use the old b^2-4ac formula, but I, I think we can factor that into lambda minus what times lambda minus what? Can you do that factorization? Four and two? Lambda minus four times lambda minus two. So the, the eigenvalues are four and two. So the eigenvalues are -- one eigenvalue, lambda one, Now I'm looking for x, the eigenvector. let's say, is four. Lambda two, the other eigenvalue, is two. The eigenvalues are four and two. And then I can go for the eigenvectors. Suppose I have a matrix A, and Ax equal lambda x. equals zero. You see I got the eigenvalues first. So if they, if this had eigenvalue lambda, Four and two. Now for the eigenvectors. So what are the eigenvectors? They're these guys in the null space when I take away, when I make the matrix singular by taking four I or two I away. So we're -- we got to do those separately. I'll -- let me find the eigenvector for four first. So I'll subtract four, so A minus four I is -- so taking four away will put minus ones there.",

But -- You could, you're -- there's some freedom in choosing that one, but choose a reasonable one. What's a vector in the null space of that? Well, the natural vector to pick as the eigenvector with, with lambda two is minus one one. If I did elimination on that vector and set that, the free variable to be one, I would get minus one and get that eigenvector. So you see then that I've got eigenvector, Now the other neat fact is that the determinant, How are those two matrices related? Well, one is just three I more than the other one, right? two. I just took that matrix and I -- I took this matrix and I added three I.",

If I, if I do something to the matrix, what happens if I -- or I know something about the matrix, what's the what's the conclusion for its eigenvectors and eigenvalues? Because -- those eigenvalues and eigenvectors are going to tell us important information about the matrix. And here what are we seeing? What's happening to these eigenvalues, one and minus one, when I add three I? It just added three to the eigenvalues. I got four and two, three more than one and minus one. What happened to the eigenvectors? Nothing at all. One one is -- and minus -- and one -- and minus one one are -- is still the eigenvectors. In other words, simple but useful observation.",

I'm going to say Bx is alpha x. Add those up, and you get A plus B x equals lambda plus alpha x. So you would think that if you know the eigenvalues of A and you knew the eigenvalues of B, then if you added you would know the eigenvalues of A plus B. But that's false. A plus B -- well, when B was three I, that worked great. But this is not so great. And what's the matter with that argument there? We have no reason to believe that x is also an eigenvector of B has some eigenvalues, B. but it's got some different eigenvectors normally. It's a different matrix. I don't know anything special. If I don't know anything special, then as far as I know, it's got some different eigenvector y, and when I add I get just rubbish. I mean, I get -- I can add, but I don't learn anything. So not so great is A plus B.",

The sum of the eigenvalues is, is going to come out zero. And the product of the eigenvalues, did I tell you about the determinant being the product of the eigenvalues?

And with, and with eigenvalues we're going to have trouble. From these equations. Let's see. Why I expecting trouble? The, the first equation says that the eigenvalues add to zero. So there's a plus and a minus. So I take the eigenvalue. But then the second equation says that the product is plus one. We're in trouble. But there's a way out. So how -- let's do the usual stuff. Look at determinant of Q minus lambda I. So I'll just follow the rules, take the determinant, subtract lambda from the diagonal, where I had zeros, the rest is the same. Rest of Q is just copied. Compute that determinant. OK, so what does that determinant equal? Lambda squared minus minus one plus what? What's up? There's my equation. My equation for the eigenvalues is lambda squared plus one equals zero.",

You switch the sign of the imaginary part. Well, this was only imaginary, had no real part, so we just switched its sign. So that eigenvalues come in pairs like that, but they're complex. A complex conjugate pair. And that can happen with a perfectly real matrix. And as a matter of fact -- so that was my, my point earlier, that if a matrix was symmetric, it wouldn't happen. So if we stick to matrices that are symmetric or, like, close to symmetric, then the eigenvalues will stay real. But if we move far away from symmetric -- and that's as far as you can move, because that matrix is -- how is Q transpose related to Q for that matrix? That matrix is anti-symmetric. Q transpose is minus Q. That's the very opposite of symmetry. When I flip across the diagonal I get -- I reverse all the signs. Those are the guys that have pure imaginary eigenvalues.",

It's really useful to know -- if you've got properties like a triangular matrix. It's very useful to know you can read the eigenvalues off. They're right on the diagonal. So the eigenvalue is three and also three. Three is a repeated eigenvalue. But let's see that happen. Let me do it right. The determinant of A minus lambda I, what I always have to do is this determinant. I take away lambda from the diagonal. I leave the rest. I compute the determinant, so I get a three minus lambda times a three minus lambda. And nothing. So that's where the triangular part came in. Triangular part, the one thing we know about triangular matrices is the determinant is just the product down the diagonal. And in this case, it's this same, repeated -- so lambda one is one -- sorry, lambda one is three and lambda two is three. That was easy. I mean, no -- why should I be pessimistic about a matrix",

I'm looking for independent eigenvectors, and what's the conclusion? There isn't one. This is a degenerate matrix. It's only got one line of eigenvectors instead of two. It's this possibility of a repeated eigenvalue opens this further possibility of a shortage of eigenvectors. And so there's no second independent eigenvector x2. So it's a matrix, it's a two by two matrix, but with only one independent eigenvector. So that will be -- the matrices that -- where eigenvectors are -- don't give the complete story.",
