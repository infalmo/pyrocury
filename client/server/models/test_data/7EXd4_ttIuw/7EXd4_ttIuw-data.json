[MUSIC] >> Hi, welcome to Visual Studio Toolbox. I'm your host Robert Green and joining me today is Tyrique White. Hey Tyrique. >> Hi Robert, thanks for having me. >> Thanks for being on the show. >> Yeah, I'm Tyrique White everyone and I'm a program manager for Python developer tools here at Microsoft. >> Cool. So we're going to talk about doing some Python, we're going to show Visual Studio code. >> Right. >> That's awesome. So give us again the very brief because I think we've talked about it before, but the very brief sweet spot for Python. I is a C-sharp developer, or a JavaScript developer, when and why should I learn Python? What are the scenarios that are most prevalent? >> Definitely. So Robert, excellent question when we get a lot at conferences. The sweet spot for Python is being able to build apps quickly. One of my demos later I'm going to show in nine lines of code I'm able to create. I'll be at a very simple web application. I still create a web application. That's the basis for Python. It's the scrapping language where people are able to prototype quickly. But it's also used for production code as well, which is super exciting. >> Okay. >> Yeah, cool. >> Yeah, awesome. So today specifically we're going to talk about Python and VS Code. For any of those who don't know,",

Then the third thing you need is an installation of Python on your machine. >> Right. >> Yeah. One misconception we find is that some people often think that the Python extension for VS Code it comes with Python and it does not currently. So one way to get around that is depending on which OS you're on. For Windows, we recommend going to python.org which I have here to download the latest release of Python, on Mac a brew install works fine and for Linux, typically the bundled version of Python that comes with the Linux works well, you get all of these features of the Python extension. >> Got it. >> Sound good. >> All right. Awesome. >>So now we've got code, we got the extension, we got Python. >> We do, I have python. Perfect. Okay. So let's get started. Let's get people accustomed to the UI here, because it is a bit different to get on-boarded. >> Okay. >> So now that I have the extension. As you can see, I have the File Explorer here. When I open a folder, I'm going to be able to see the tree view of that folder, see all the dependencies and all the files within there. I have a debugger icon which we'll talk about later. I have a lot of other things. VS Code comes inbox with source control. So I can use my favorite repos, connect to those, and do all of that stuff I know and love.",

How does that sound? >> Sounds great. >> Another cool thing is, by default when you install VS Code on Windows, it adds VS Code to the path. I'll show you exactly what that means. So what I want to do is I want to navigate to my Command Prompt, and I'm going to find my Demos folder that I have here. I'm going to create a new folder for us. I'm going to call it VS toolbox. I'm going to navigate to that folder. Now what's really cool is, because I have VS Code on the path on my Windows machine, all I have to do is type code. into the Command Prompt, and it will open up an instance of VS Code inside of that folder. >> Okay. >> You can see that from my File Explorer here. >> So you can open the folder from code, you can go to the folder and launch code from that location? >> Exactly. On Linux and Mac you have to run a command to get VS Code on path, but it's super handy if your command line focus. So now what I'm going to do actually is create a new file.

Sorry, excuse me, a Python file. >> Okay. >>.Py is the file type. As you can see I'm immediately, to verify that extension is activated, I actually have Python down here in my toolbar. If I click on this, it gives me the list of all the different interpreters I have installed on my machine for Python. >> Is it okay when you installed Python? >> Well, I've installed multiple different versions for different reasons; for testing, for a playing around. But these are all the interpreter versions I have. As the extension can pick up most of those if they are in the standard places which they typically are when you install Python. So pretty cool stuff there. So we created our file. So now what I want to do is I want to talk about the command palette. That's going to be super helpful for us because for developers who are bit more Command Line driven, you want to have that terminal experience inside the editor. So in order to get to what I call the Command Palette, you're going to do on a Windows machine Control Shift P, to bring up the Command Palette. Again, the Command Palette has all of the commands you could ever want and love for Python. All those commands of Python or denoted by Python colon.",

Some code may not run, something may get broken. So typically what we recommend for Python developers is to create a virtual environment which I'm going to show you how to do now. Cool. So back to my command line here. So I'm in my VS toolbox folder. I have my hello.Py file, print \"Hello world\", we're all good. So there are different commands depending on the OS you're using. I'm actually going to show you when we're on those command. Then also we can look at the Linux, Mac command. But in order to run, to create a virtual environment from the command line, what I want to do is I want to type Py, short for Python -3 for the version of Python I'm going to use. Dash m, which is saying, okay, I'm going to pass a module that I want you to use. This module is called VM, short for virtual environment which makes sense. I'm actually going to call our virtual environments. Give me any name you want. What's your favorite folder name? >> My favorite folder name, pictures. >> Pictures. Cool. >> What's really cool is you notice this pop-up that comes. It says. \"We noticed a new virtual environment has been created, do you want to select it for the workspace folder?\" What's really cool about that is if I select \"Yes\" and navigate to my.vscode folder here, you'll see that we include this line",

So a couple of things to immediately notice about this application, is it's a simple web application using the popular Python package flask which is a weighted just create simple web applications, and to answer your question Robert, I have a virtual environment here called \"vstoolbox\". Again, I pre-created this so it saved when I opened it back up. What's even better is that I could actually activate that virtual environment inside the terminal in two ways. So if your command line driven again the way in which you're going to activate a virtual environment on a Windows machine is you can start with the virtual environment name, so vstoolbox backslash because we're on Windows, scripts backslash activate and you'll see that the virtual environment is activated by this parentheses with the virtual environment name. >> So then does that information store like in source control. So if I take this app, put it in GitHub, go home, clone it, and bring it down locally I have not only the code but also the environment information? >> Yeah, absolutely. If you want to share the virtual environment with developers in your team or with friends you definitely can do that. I'll also show you or you can just create a new one, but I'll show you. We've talked a little bit about that but I think it'll come full circle in a minute.",

What it'll do is it'll open a new terminal for you with this virtual environment already activated. So some really cool stuff here. Let's explore the editor for a minute. So you guys or everyone has probably noticed the yellow squiggles that are appearing here. These yellow squiggles are what we call linting messages, and so what's important to know is that the first time you install the Python extension it's going to ask if you want to install a linter. The default currently as Pylint, and so it is going to ask you if you want to use Pylint, but we also support other lenting tools like Flake8 etc. So what you're seeing here are these linting messages. So if I hover over those linting messages, it's telling me, it's saying, \"Hey, I can't find unresolved import text blob.\" So what that essentially means, is that, it can't find this package inside of my virtual environments. So it's giving me an error which is super useful because it gives me a code diagnostic or a problem which I can also view under problems here, and you see that I have the list of problems, unresolved import Flask, unresolved import textblob. So what we can do actually is install those.",

So back to your original point. Depending on the kind of setup you prefer what source control, you may send up your virtual environments so people can download it and just activate it or you might just send up the requirements.txt file and allow people to first create a virtual environment and then install all the packages thing here. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to install those packages from this requirements.txt file, so back to my command line notice again that I'm still inside this virtual environment because I want all these packages contains locally to this application. So I'm going to go pip install -r and then requirements.txt and hit \"Enter\". What you're going to notice is you're going to notice that it's going to find those packages and install them for me. It's getting the list, I've downloaded these before so it's just using the cache diversions of these guys. What's important to note is that when it installs these you're going to notice that these error messages are going to go away, which is really cool. So while it's installing those packages let's explore this application a bit.",

I have a simple homepage here which is just saying, \"Python loves vstoolbox,\" and this is actually a really cool application because it's not only just a simple web application but it's the sentimentapi is the title of the folder denotes. So what this is going to allow us to do, is it's going to allow us to hit an end point with a Word and this API is going to help us determine the sentiment of that word because maybe I just need help determining what kind of sentiment words have. So very cool it finished installing the packages for us, and notice that my problems went away, and suddenly if I hover over Flask I get documentation for it. Text blob I Get-module text blob which is really cool stuff. So now what I want us to do we explore this application. So let's actually run this application. There are couple of ways you can run it. I want to run it using the debugger, because I also want to use this as a moment to talk about debugging and kind of what that gets you. As I stated previously, this is a sentiment API pretty simple only less than perhaps 10 lines of code if you take out all the comments and the spaces, and that's again the beauty of Python's your earlier point in less than 20 lines of code, essentially, I can create a powerful sentiment API. I have some to do for myself actually,",

So what it actually does that passes in that message to the textblock module and then it does some stuff under the hood then with cool sentiment polarity etc. >> Cool. >> So we reassign that sentiment has negative, and then what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to return that sentiment on the page, on the web application page which you'll see in a second. So cool. Let's run the application. >> All right. >> I'm going to run it using the debugger actually because there are a couple of things I want to talk about. So let's set a breakpoint on line 15, notice that I clicked to the left of the line number which is called the gutter. For those of you who are used to debugging it's going to be the same kind of feel, for those who aren't fear not it's super easy to get started with the debugger. So to start this, there are a couple of ways I can run my debugger and I'm going to just collapse that so I can give you full attention here. I can use the toolbar, click \"Debug\" and click \"Start debugging.\" It also has the keyboard shortcut F5 and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start doing that. Notice that when I click \"Start debugging\" it's going to present to debug configuration menu. We have a list of popular templates that we know Python developers use. Remember earlier I mentioned that this is a Flask gap? >> Yeah. >> So you can see that Flask is in that configuration list, and so that's what I wanted and I'm going to select it.",

Once I hit \"Enter\" it's going to start debugging for me and notice that this toolbar down here changes to orange to denote that I'm in debugging mode. Another cool thing is that debug icon here becomes highlighted in white, so you can see that I'm also debugging as well. >> I guess it did. >> It did, yeah. >> Okay. >> I've never noticed that. >> Yeah. It's a pretty cool nifty thing. >> But at the same time, do you remember, I never tend to notice these things back, you remember the big controversy over in Visual Studio the menu choices at the top are all caps and it was a big controversy. >> That actually predates my time in Microsoft. >> Anyway, I discovered that because there was a controversy. >> No, yeah. >> Enough about me, let's get back to the app. >> Yeah. So to debug a web app, another thing that people getting started with web apps may not know is that in order to hit that break point that I've sent on line 15, I actually need to navigate to the URL that it's giving me here. >> Okay. >> So it tells me that it's running on this URL, and what's really cool is that inside VS code",

You notice that as I step, it's said \"okay\" remember we say that we determined all sentiments to be positive at first, and then we run them through this if statement. So I'm just going to step over again. In order to continue, I can either hit the arrow here to continue and run it all the way through, or I can just hit \"F5\". So I'm going to hit \"Continue\" again. If I navigate back to my API, I see that the word \"Champion\" is positive. >> Nice. Yeah, pretty cool. >> All right, let's do another test. >> Let's do another test. >> Yes. Let's test a new message. >> Okay, let's test a new message. This time, I'm going to rerun this, but I'm going to try and rerun it a different way, I'm still using the debugger but a slightly different way. So this time, to run this application with the break point set on line 15, I'm going to use my debug icon that I mentioned earlier. Here's what's really cool about this is that the debug icon gives me access to the configuration menu that I saw before. So if I click this \"drop-down\" and select \"Add configuration\", what it's going to do and then I have to hit the green \"play\" button, start debugging, it's going to send me into that same debug configuration menu. >> Okay. >> You may be wondering, \"Oh Tyrique, why do I have to type this again?\", and it's because our configuration last time wasn't saved, and so by going through these steps we're going through now, we're saving that configuration and I'll prove that to you in a second.

We find that this launch file is very scary or intimidating for people who are first starting out with VS code, but fear not, it's simply an array. It's a JSON format, an array with a list of different configurations. But notice that. >> Everything's saved. >> It saves, right, and my startup path is saved. I have some different arguments here which are on by default, and to show you where it gets saved, if you navigate back to your file explorer by using the explorer button here, the dot VS code folder, if there wasn't one created before, it'll be created for you and you'll have that logic configuration saved. This is an important because, again, you don't have to go through the startup steps again to save it. So let's go back to my debugger, and you notice, see it says \"this time\" instead of \"AD configuration\" or \"no configuration\" like it said before, I get Python flask. Another important thing to realize about debugging is that, notice that I'm currently inside of the \"launch.json\" file. If I start the debugger here it will actually throw an error because it thinks I'm trying to debug this JSON. So in order to avoid that, I need to go back actually to the file that I'm trying to debug. So we're going to hit our green \"play\" button.",
