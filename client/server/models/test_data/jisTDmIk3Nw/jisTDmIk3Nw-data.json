GANG CHEN: So this is Nano-to-Macro Transport Process, 2.570 for undergraduate students and 2.57 for graduate student. And it's offered every two years. So I'm glad to say, this is probably the largest audience I've ever had. And so I'm very pleased to say the growing popularity. The last time we did OpenCourseWare I think was in 2004. And that one, we had voice recording and typewritten notes. And you can still go to the MIT OpenCourseWare if you miss a lecture, I think. Although we do have changes, The changes are not dramatic. So you can go there and try to make them up if you miss any lectures. And this semester MIT has a new initiative trying to put the course or video online. And so I volunteered.",

And in addition to my book, there are also a list of books recommend because you'll see that this course really cover a wide range of topics. So we have given a list of references for each subject. You can always go to other books. This is not necessarily the easiest to understand but to say we put it on reserve in the library. And with that, I think, it's pretty much the housekeeping item done. And what I'm going to do next is to give you some slide. I'm not going to show slides every week. But I'm going to give you some slides to see what's the scope of this course and some motivational slide. \u00bfSo any questions? If you look at the title, this is Nano-to-Macro Transport Process. So we're emphazising nano, we're emphasizing transport, we're also emphasizing the transition from nano to macro. So this is a slide from a colleague of mine. And here we're showing the length scales-- that's in nature-- and length scales for what we make,",

I think the gate length in semiconductors now is just around a few tenths, 10, 20 nanometers. So those are the-- we're making smaller and smaller devices. And of course at the end, what we're interfacing is at the macro scale. So when we go to small scales, the questions, because you have learned a lot in the transport theory, for example-- the question is are they valid or not and if they are not valid, what are the alternatives.

            "text": " what's the picture there? So this is where this course is trying to wrestle with. And that's in fact-- most of my research is looking into thinking how we can look at the small and then how using the small to do the big things. Particularly, most of the work I'm working on is heat transfer related to energy and energy as a large scale, so how I can take small to go to the large. And let me give you two examples from research to show that when you go to nanoscale, the classical theory that you have learned breaks down. And the first example is a heat conduction example. We know in heat conduction we have Fourier law. And we have thermal conductivity of the materials. And this is one example of nano. This is in fact transmission electron microscope image of a layered structure. One layer, the bright layer is silicon. The darker layer is germanium. So each layer is about 2 nanometers. And then when you measure thermal conductivity-- so you can take a silicon because one layer is silicon. The other is germanium. So you have started heat transfer. It's parallel plates. And then you can do thermal resistors to say what's the effect with thermal conductivity.",

But the experimentally measured dots are order of magnitude smaller. And in fact, we have to go to complete different theory. In this case, we have to go to Boltzmann equation to predict now-- See, this is a work that we started in 90's, and now we're doing quantum calculations on those structures. So there's significant departure from the classical theory when you go to nano scales. And as another example, you learned in thermal radiation, [? black ?] body is the maximum of thermal radiation. But, see, say when we go to nanoscale, when we put the two objects smaller, the distance-- this was on MIT web page. I really like this. They're very creative. What should I say? This is better than what we did. So that's Planck's law, black body radiation. And that's usually considered maximum. And when we put two surfaces down to nanoscale-- right here is one micron, 100 nanometer, and 10 nanometer. We can go beyond the Planck's law by several order of magnitude.

            "text": " And we're taking that to make a better thermal electric energy converters because we need the materials with the pool heat conduction, and we still need the electron goes through. So this is a very contradictory requirement. And currently we're working on this photon side that we're designing nanostructure using less material to do solar cells. And we have some of the most conductive liquid just by putting nanoparticles in the liquid and find out what's the thermal conductivity. In fact, at the end we say, I don't want everything nano. That's where you understand if you understand physics-- now that's everything is nano. So we work on people putting nanoparticle into liquid. Some say have high thermal conductivity. Others go to lab, they say, no, we can't measure it. We struggled for four years and eventually figured out-- we say, OK, eventually what we need is macro in one direction and nano in the other direction. And that's how we achieve the best thermal conductivity. And we also have the most conductive polymers. I get a call every month almost from an industry to say, can we have it? So the question was polymers, plastics, are typically poor heat condition. So people always want to make them more conductive.",

I started thinking of plastics and how I make them more conductive. And if you look at how people usually do it, they'll put in a composite. They'll put a lot of component and make them average peak and higher heat conduction. And when I think about this, OK, of course that's one of the approach. But, see, the question we ask is a molecule, a polymer, really a poor conductor? Is a molecular chain a pool heat conductor? If you think of a polyethylene, which is 60% of the plastics. And it's a carbon per carbon bonding. And carbon-carbon, what's the highest of the thermal conductivity material? Anyone know? STUDENT: Diamond. GANG CHEN: Diamond, carbon-carbon bond. So that suggests in the molecular chain direction, I should have a high heat thermal conductivity. So you think about the nano. You think about molecules. And in fact, I say, of course, I can put that in more fancier theory. I go to Fermi, and he did work in the '50s. And he said one-dimensional conductor has an infinite thermal conductivity. So that gave me a lot of motivation to look into that.",

We do more research because I need to scale this up, because you eventually are not using single nanofiber to put in your heat exchangers. So that's what I say. You need to think of nano. You have a lot of. You can generate more new ideas but also to think to how you can go to macro. So when I say, what's nano for energy. If you think about the energy, at the end it's molecules that mechanical engineer are familiar with. It's the electrons, and it's a photon, the light or its lattice vibration phonon. Those are the basic energy carrier. There are some other terms. But let's say those are the basic energy carriers. What's their characteristic length, the mean free pass and the wavelengths? So the mean free pass of air molecule will get into that very strong. In this room it's about 100 nanometer. And that means they travel about 100 nanometer and the collide with another molecule.",

And so a lot of this in the nanometer range. And if you think about energy, fundamentally, if you can control the energy level a material has-- for example, if I make a quantum dots that I show before, 5 nanometer spheres, particles, what happens is an electron, quantum mechanics-- it's a wave. And wave has a wavelength. And typical wavelengths is let's say, 10 nanometer. Now a wave of 10 nanometer, you try to fit into that 5 nanometer quantum dot what happens. You squeeze that wave. You squeeze that wave the energy level will change. So if you look at professor Moungi Bawendi's home page, you will see the quantum dots of different colors. That's because the energy level change when you make the size change. So that's one way you can control the energy. If you control the energy, now come to mechanical engineering",

And the other is, let's say, transport. If you look at where the losses are. If you say, OK, second law of color. Let's say you can get to color efficiency, pretty good. If you can get all color efficiency, you should all be pleased. But, we lose about 60% of a useful energy. If you look at the energy, input, output, and color. Let's say you can get to [? 90%. ?] So you can improve the transport if you can control the energy carrier traveling, their interaction, their traveling. So I said that the air molecule is about 100 nanometers, the mean free path. And that seems so awfully small. But if you open your computer, you look at the hard disk, the separation between the disk itself, which is rotating about 10,000 RPM and the magnetic head is a few nanometers, few nanometers in everybody's computer.

So that's the transport. In transport, you have continuum laws. You have also-- You need to go to the long continuum. You need to vary weather. You need to see in quantum regime where you have to look at the wave later or you can forget about it. So what I would like to have is to develop that picture. If you have a problem and people come to you and say, well, in this regime, I'm varying the weather, I can still use the continuum. If you feel comfortable to tell them, yeah, there's no problem, just go, you may get 10% error, 20% error. But at least say, I want to develop the comfort level of when you can use, say, what kind of transport pictures. And in fact, I say, if you look at the book, it's a parallel treatment. Say for electrons, molecules, photons, phonons. So that's the way I understand the object, the subject.",

            "text": " And I've been always a mechanical engineer. I first learned thermal radiation, photons, and of course, I learned all this continuum theory. And it turns out that if you understand the one carrier, you can make a rudder. It's easy, relatively easy analogy for other carriers. And at least in this so-called the dilute gas picture, the behavior are very similar. So this is what I'm most familiar with a wave Maxwell equation. But, see, this is where most engineers familiar with, Ohms law, Fourier's law, Newton's Shear Stress law, this other continuum. But, say, if I go to photon radiation, where if you think about the photon from the sun to Earth, you don't got to solve diffusion question for that. In fact, I say, the surplus is just a straight trajectory, ballistic. This will happens if I have a disk drive. I have a disk, the example here. Averagely speaking, the molecule travel 100 nanometer. And now the molecule, if there is a molecule in the gap, they'll collide the wall. They don't collide with each other.",

So it's a very-- The challenge for this is most of you-- I know most of my students, they are mechanical engineers, with mechanical engineering background. And that's where we're most familiar with, most comfortable with. And what we add to this is a lot of new subjects and typically take many years to build up. It took myself many years to build up. So I'm very ambitious to say, I want to teach you one semester. You will be inundated with terminology. OK. And also, but what I'm hoping is at the end you gain something. You can look and say I have a sense of from nano from molecules to the continuum. So that's what we have in the general introduction any questions. I want to feel free to ask questions",

Maybe you know what these people are talking. So, say, if I want to start with any journal, not medical, not biomedical. I'm not familiar with that. Any other journal, you tell me.

And so when I look at this, quantum coherence the coupling of a mechanical oscillator to optical cavity mode. I look at that paper. I haven't read it. Clearly, what I was thinking-- Anybody want to guess what they will be talking about? So you will say, I don't know. OK, so my guess is they were probably related to force, momentum of photons. It's mechanical. And so it turns out that the photon has the momentum, and it carries force. Anything that has momentum can generate force. So optical cavity, so you will learn this stuff, OK.",

But what I can say is the optical cavity, the modes and also, the coherency issue we'll talk, not exactly related to photon but related to transport, how I can go from that normally the wave of a coherent state to eventually I can forget about the coherence of the waves and treat them as particles. So my point is to say at the end, what I'm hoping is that you'll open a journal like Applied Physics and Nano Letters or Science and Literature, you're not scared. OK. There are a lot of terminologies that you probably didn't know, and they'll stick to you and through to you. And maybe you'll remember something. OK, so let's start talking more details. So what I want to start with is for you to think about what are the laws you have learned. Let's see what are they-- OK, I want to get the--",

So let's say you learn-- some of you are familiar with heat, some of you may be familiar with the charge or fluids or mass. Tell me the laws in those disciplines. OK, so let's do heat. Heat in terms of the laws, the Fourier law is for heat condition. So conduction, this course, I put a prerequisite at the 2005 five level. And 2005 from other department is basic heat conduction, heat transfer thermal fluids course. And in other department there is also, of course, nanoengineering. If you've taken that, this will be easier because there are a lot of-- there's some overlap. But say, if not, you can still survive. So heat conduction, we have the simplest picture when one side is hot, the other side is a cold.",

Fourier of heat conduction, the heat flux equals thermal conductivity times temperature gradient. And this is one dimension that I'm reading. And this is a heat flux. The unit here is a watt meter squared. And the thermal conductivity is a mature property at the macro scale. When you go to [? nano, ?] you'll find this is no longer material property because it's structure dependent. But the unit of that is watt per meter per Kelvin. And then we just said diamond is the most heat conductive material. And in fact, some people would say it's the carbon nanotube of graphene. So this is on the nanoscale. On one side they can go very high. And the other side-- they give an example-- it can go very low. So this is one of the laws, transport laws. And this is the conservation law. And for this law, what do we call?",

So for convection, of course, for those who know Navier-Stokes equation, and you need these very complicated partial differentiable equations-- but in the simplest picture when we do convection is I have a heated surface. Let's say this is a wall. And I have a fluid. And away from the wall the fluid temperature is Ta ambient. And then I write the law for cooling is q equals h Tw minus Ta.

The unit of age is different from k if you look at what we had for Fourier law, and it's watt meter squared per Kelvin? h is not a material property. It depends on how fast is the fluid, what fluid that you use, and the geometry. So for that you need to go to a Navier-Stokes equation to solve if the case is simple. If its case is complicated, you've got to do the experiment. And then one thing I want to remind you if you do fluids problem or heat transfer convection, on the wall you often invoke a condition. What is that condition? STUDENT: Low slip. GANG CHEN: Low slip. So the velocity of molecule is 0 or equal to the velocity of the wall and the temperature of the wall. That's the low slip boundary recognition and area view. [INAUDIBLE] fluids or heat transfer [? knows ?] that. But I say, that's not valid. That's not true. In fact, there's always slip. There's always velocity and temperature slip.",

GANG CHEN: Radiation, let's look at radiation. What's the radiation law? OK, so let's write step from Bolztmann q equals for black body, sigma T4. And the Stefan Bolztmann constant, the 5.67 10 to the minus 8 watt meter squared. And in this case because it's not linear with the temperature, so you have to use Kelvin, Kelvin fourth power. And I already commented before we can go if we go nano. We can go way beyond this. OK. So those are the heat transfer laws. I'm more ambitious. I want to hear more. If you're an electrical engineer, you tell me, well, chemical engineer. What are the transport laws of fluids? These are the ones that I'm familiar with. STUDENT: Drift diffusion for electric transport. GANG CHEN: OK, drift diffusion. Let me simplify it further.",

So even though, say in most of the classes you're probably given, but you can use the simplest picture by counting the numbers. And if you have a gradient of velocity, you have gradient of temperature, you have gradient. You have electrical field. You'll see that this can be-- When you go to see the granular picture, those laws can be easily derived. And I'll show you in the lecture next lecture how to derive them. OK. So we say that those are the continuum. Those are the ones at least you feel comfortable. And the question we ask is when we go to nano, are those still valid. If they are not valid, what alternatives we have? And to do that, we need to go to granular picture. We need to look at the individual chart, individual molecules, and individual photons.",

I take helium. STUDENT: Solutions colliding with each other and the latest [INAUDIBLE] for the kinetic energy. GANG CHEN: So this side is hotter. And the gas molecule, they do random motion. When I say random motion about half of them will go this way, and they were colliding with the [INAUDIBLE] at higher temperature. And what they gain is they gain a higher kinetic energy because this is a higher temperature. When they bounce back, they have higher kinetic energy faster. So we begin energy when the collision, and they bounce back. The next molecule they say will have slightly lower energy. So it's the two-ball collision problem. And during that process, they'll pass some of the energy to the next molecule, and the next molecule against",

They're bound by the ions, but they actually can mold quite a few distances beyond. Their not just to say that these are free electrons. The electron actually can move around, and again they will have a collision distance. We said that the air molecule collision distance is about 100 nanometer. An electron collision distance can be a few nanometer to even longer, 100 nanometer. Or your micron depends on temperature. So isn't it amazing [? minutes ?] of atom if you think of 1 micron. How many atoms there? And the electron can zip through them and no collision. So of course at the end there is a collision. So if you think about that case is the electron, power, a few distance, and they collide. And that's the same process. So it's the electron gas. Will you give a name like a gas? So it's the electron gas.",

I said, I work on heat transfer. And the guy said, oh, you work on phonons. And then most mechanical engineer when they work heat transfer they don't know what to do with the phonon. And some-- none you probably just as a graduate from undergraduate degree, mechanical engineering. How many of you have heard of the phonon in heat transfer course? Polarity. OK. So what is a phonon? I had a once-- I was teaching at a another university, and I had a colleague. And he sat in my class, and he said I still don't know what is a phonon. What do what is a photon? Yes, [INAUDIBLE]?

So they have their equilibrium position, and they are holding together by these springs. So this spring, now you have this network. You look at it. It has a vibration.

But say it's very similar to photon. Photon don't have a mass. It turns out. The photon has the frequency, and the fundamental unit, again, is h, mu for photon.

So if you do that and going through, this is where you will have to wait probably until chapter 5 that it will go from the vibrational modes. It's a wave. We say eventually I treat them as particles and as a phonon gas. So I go from that wave picture mode to a gas picture in the solid. So for the heat conduction it's the phonon gas in the solid. And once I think about the gas, it's the same picture. When one side is hard, that phonon gas [INAUDIBLE] to gain higher energy. And they go to [? less, ?] so the phonon mean free pass, again, the collision between the phonons. And it turns out that it's a wide range. And we're doing quantum calculations on this. And some of them is 1 nanometer. Others is 1 micron. OK. So for heat conduction that basic picture is this gas picture. That's why I'm treating phonon, electron and photon.",

They go ballistic. There's no scattering until they reach the Earth. OK. So that's the conduction convection. What's the difference? Microscopic pressure for convection. We say, OK, you have [INAUDIBLE].. And the ambient we gave the Newton flow of cooling. So what's the microscopic picture of convection? What's the difference from conduction? STUDENT: Non-zero average [INAUDIBLE].. GANG CHEN: Yeah, very good answer. So what in heat conduction is molecules are moving randomly. And they are moving at a 300 meter per second, pretty fast. But their average velocity vector is 0. So for the conduction, we have the average velocity zero,",

But I said the molecules are always doing random motion 300 meter per second much faster. But you know convection is more effective. That's because they are not a diffusion, because when they move from one place to another place, they carry all that energy directly from one place to another. The energy [? is in ?] [? enthalpy. ?] So that's the fundamental difference. You still got those random motions. So when you go back to think about Navier-Stokes equation, you still have heat conduction term there. That random motion is still there, but you got a convective term. OK. So that's a convection. And in fact, if you take that, convection is almost the same as conduction, except rather than-- it just have a direct [? momentum. ?] So I would say it's fundamental is not too new a picture at this scale.

GANG CHEN: So the radiation from the heat source is the photon, the radiation, electromagnetic wave from radial source. We normally don't call it the photon. It's also a photon. It is an o-photon. An o-photon in free space, you learn this at high school, the speed of light, wavelength frequency. Which channel do you turn? What's the frequency? I turn to 98.5. But I forgot that megahertz or kilohertz, though. It doesn't matter. Is it megahertz or kilohertz do I think? Anybody remember? STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]. GANG CHEN: I can't. So let me just put 100 kilohertz. I know there are 200 kilohertz range. And so what's the wavelength, speed of light.",

It is covering a wide range of frequency. But there's still oscillating current. I don't think, see, all radiation is a thermal motion. It's just thermally generated oscillating current. And think about the atoms. Think about electrons. One electron, move it around, the general color. So it's the thermally random motion generated, and this is a much smaller oscillator much faster.",

            "text": " So if you think about wavelengths. It's the 0.5 micron. It's 0.5 10 to the minus 6. This is 10 to the 14 then. Frequency is 10 to 14, is a lot longer, 100 kilohertz. OK. So that's the big difference. But let's say in terms of propagation of thermal radiation, it's actually the same [? maximum ?] equation. It's not different from what the electrical engineer does. It's the source that's different. Once they are out the propagation, you write the same equation. OK. So at the end, there are not many equations. And so that's the heat transfer. We can go other. We can pick up another object, subject here, let's say charge. Ohm's law. I want to show you easily how I can derive Ohm's law. And let's look at the charge. And of course, I do a lot of hand-waving. And I have a conductor, electrons.",

There's a moment average velocity of the charge. OK. And now if I have this velocity, I can write the current. The current, what's current? Current is just the charge per unit time going across a certain area. So if I look at the current because if we access the average velocity. So if I know the charge density per unit volume, then I write my J equals the current. Jx is the charge that's in column times n and times vx. That's my current density. If you look at the unit E.

And then you do this meter per second. And you get that here is a column per meter squared per second. Column per meter square is m per meter squared. That's your current density. So if I plug-in there, what I have is e squared and tau, n times n times epsilon x. That's Ohm's law. This is my electric conductivity. This is sigma epsilon, x. OK. Let's do another then. So I have heat. I have charge. I have a lot of thing about force. Let's think about the momentum, the pressure.",

Again, the density, molecular density n, and they are coming towards their wall and bounce back. So let me just make my simplest perfecting wall. So the coming velocity equals the bouncing back velocity. So it's a factor of 2. And I have a lot of molecules here. This molecular density is n to random. So half of them coming towards the wall. So is one half n, and in terms of the rate the time comes is still vx. That's the rate. That's the rate they're coming. And this gave me the delta-t I need. And then say I have 2mvx. I'm assuming like I said this vx is just reflecting back. So this will give me pressure. Again you go to check a unit. OK. So what I get? I get this pressure equals nmvx squared.",

OK, so what I have here is nm, one third v squared. OK. Now I want to show you ideal gas law. And v squared. And this is-- You have to go. You have to wait a little bit. But then let me give you the equal partition. That's a statistical thermal, says here equals nv squared because it has three vxv by zbz. So each of these modes will give you this Boltzmann constant times t. So this one you're with, statistical thermal, fundamental result, equal partition. OK. So I plug-in this. What I have? That one third cancel that 3. One half cancel mv squared is kbt. So what I have here is then is nkbt, and this is ideal gas law.",

So basically where we're going is to look at those microscopic picture and look at the electrons, look at the photons, look at molecule photons, and count this end, count how many we have, count how much energy they have, and count how long they travel. And with that you can do all the counting. So the host thread line for the transport is accounting the basic thing, the microscopic carriers. And for that we need to go in another, more detail. OK. So any questions? We'll stop here. STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]. GANG CHEN: Oh, yeah, I send a questionnaire.
