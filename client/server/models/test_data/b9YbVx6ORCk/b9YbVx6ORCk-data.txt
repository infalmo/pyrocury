Now if you answered mostly B you most likely are an introvert, but it's not so black and white it's not that you're either an introvert or an extrovert and you're on one side or the other it's actually more like a scale so you could be really completely introverted you like your time alone or you could be really completely extroverted that you need to be around other people or you could fall anywhere on that scale now as for me I definitely fall kind of towards the middle but I definitely am an introvert now someone who falls right in the middle is actually called an ambivert. Now I'd like you to take a moment and ask yourself \"what is an introvert?\" most people think introverts are loners or hermits, nerdy or strange, unfriendly or antisocial, now normally this is not actually the case and you might not even be an introvert even though you believe you are one you might actually be a shy extrovert. Now most people think that shyness and introversion are synonyms but this is actually not the case so let's start off with shyness what is shyness?",

            "text": " Now shyness is the fear of social judgment, now shyness is painful introversion is not for English learning it's probably that fear that you feel of making mistakes of people laughing at you or of failing, it's that uncomfortableness that you feel because you sound like a child, it's even the shame that you feel about speaking up in any sort of situation where you can speak English. Now you certainly should not feel shame for making mistakes it's really a natural part of the process but that's a really big topic and we'll definitely talk about it in a different video but what I want you to see here is that both extroverts and introverts can feel shyness and not all introverts are necessarily shy, so you could be a shy extrovert or you could be a confident introvert in fact I actually have a friend who I recently was just shocked to find out is actually an introvert because anytime we go to any social gathering she is really confident she goes up to other people she's curious about them, she asks really great questions and she seems to just shine in these kind of situations. So definitely by this description it sounds like my friend is an extrovert, right? Well it's actually not the case and we'll see why in just a few moments but for now what I want you to see is that if you are an introvert it does not mean that you cannot overcome your shyness and be confident and I want the rest of the tips in this video to help you to reach your really confident self while still proudly being an introvert so if introversion is not shyness then what",

            "text": " say no because they would prefer just to stay in and be on their own. Now this of course also means that you can be a  non shy introvert like Bill Gates or Meryl Streep Now while they definitely value their time alone to recharge there are authentic people and they don't really care what others think about them. Now of course you could also be a shy introvert and it's not unlikely in fact many introverts are shy because when they were younger they received some sort of negative feedback telling them that it was wrong that they preferred being alone or reflecting or it could just be lack of experience because introverts naturally avoid stimulating situations. Now if you are a shy introvert it might be soothing to you to recognize that extroverts can also be shy it isn't easy for every extrovert to be on a stage or to be in a really social environment in fact we recently did a lesson teaching English with Shakira and through watching a lot of interviews with her I discovered that she's actually really shy but I would be willing to bet that she is definitely an extrovert because she has a tremendous presence when she's on stage so she actually used what she was passionate about to overcome her shyness and we'll talk about that more later in the video. All right so that's all for this first tip we'll be going through the next ten much faster but as we do I want you to start reflecting already on whether you are introverted, shy or both so let's get into the next one so the next tip is to actually start speaking online through Whatsapp or another similar chatting tool.",

So as I mentioned before introverts tend to prefer deep conversations with one other person and for exactly this reason I highly recommend that you try to create a strong relationship with someone in English now a great way to do this can be to get a teacher, a coach, a tutor or a language partner now the first reason that this is really great is because you get to know them and they get to know you there's not as much pressure because it's one-on-one and you know when the conversations going to end because it's usually just one hour or so. Now if you get a teacher or a coach,  a good one anyway they will have a lot of experience and they will help you to grow your confidence without judging you or another great option is to practice English with other learners like I mentioned we do this in the Fluency Circle and this is really awesome because they have empathy for you they know exactly what you're going through. So one of our strengths is an introvert is making and sticking to a plan so use that strength I highly recommend that you start out by forcing yourself to do something where you'll have to speak English now this could be to an English event or a language exchange this could be talking with someone in English from your work that you know is from another country or it could even just be going up to a tourist on the street and starting a conversation. Now for me personally I  love going to language exchanges",

            "text": " you could do just to give you an example is that you could agree with yourself that one time a week you're going to go to some event where you can speak English and basically your goal during that time is to have one conversation with just one person to get that person's contact and then to continue the conversation later so that you can continue practicing your English and then if you do that that really pretty small thing then you can go home and you don't have to feel guilty about no to any other opportunities that week also as a part of your plan I recommend actually having a time that you're going to leave that way you can go home and recharge yourself but you definitely need to make the most of the time that you have there so the rest of the tips are also going to help you a lot with developing this plan so let's continue. Now another one of your strengths is introvert is that you are probably a great listener, introverts tend to be more focused than extroverts so put this to use put the focus on the other person be curious be a great listener ask smart questions and people love talking about themselves and this is a really great way to get people to like you. Now I know everyone wants  to improve their speaking but you definitely need to recognize input versus output now input is what goes in basically reading and listening output is what goes out so that's writing and speaking now actually in order to improve your speaking input is super important you need to do much more of input so listening is really important to develop your skills as a speaker.",

            "text": " So as I mentioned earlier extroverts  tend to like small talk like talking about the weather sports or other similar topics but introverts tend to prefer deeper topics and this is actually why you might be at like a dinner party or something and see an introvert who's really quiet and you might think well that person's really shy but it's not actually about shyness they're probably just thinking this topic just doesn't really interest me so I'm not gonna say anything so as part of your plan to speak more and to overcome your shyness one thing that you can actually do is write down at home things that you're really interested in talking about and then you can actually practice by yourself speaking about these you can even record yourself and listen back to give yourself feedback or another thing that you could do is tell that other person about something that you recently learned now doing things like this are going to not only increase your confidence but they'll actually probably get you really excited to talk about the topics that you're actually  interested in. So as an introvert I know you're going to want to avoid making mistakes but remind yourself that for that short amount of time that you're having a conversation with another person that the mistakes are great you need to make a lot of them and act in order to improve so don't let them get you embarrassed make a mental note to learn from them later but stay present while you're in that conversation and speaking of embarrassment it's really important that you start seeing it as something positive all that it means is that you care what other people think of you and studies have shown that people tend to see other people's embarrassment as an indicator of that",

All right so the next tip is to actually connect your English to another passion of yours, so before we talked about going to language learning events or English speaking events but this is not the only way to practice your English another really great way to meet people is by actually finding ways that connect to things you're passionate about so for example say that you love tennis what you could do is find some different tennis forms online and connect with people there who share your passion and then talk to them about this interest you could even connect with them via Skype maybe you can even connect to people in your city to give you an example with myself right now I'm actually taking vocal coaching and one thing that has been really great is that not only am i learning about something new but I'm actually learning vocabulary in Spanish related to that thing that I'm interested in and actually improving my vocabulary in the language I'm learning. So this also gives you a whole new purpose for learning English I could give you another example from one of our team members Agnieszka who is also an introvert and she also used to be quite shy but she has really blossomed and she's used her english to do it she actually joined Toastmasters which was something that she wanted to become a better public speaker and so she's had to actually give speeches in front of other people in her native language",

All right guys thanks so much for joining me today now a lot of today's lesson has been based on a fantastic book called Quiet by Susan Cain now if you are an introvert then I believe this is a must read to really get to understand yourself and your strengths as an introvert a great way to get started with this is by watching Susan Cain's TED talk which I'll link up at the top. Now as introverts we need to recognize that for better or for worse the world really rewards extroverts but that doesn't mean that the world doesn't also need us to really be our best as introverts bringing our reflective creative and innovative ideas to our workplaces and to what we're contributing to the world so I really want to just challenge you to start doing this in your English and in your life and if you're an introvert and you have a great story to share with us then I would really love to hear it we have a new post about this over on Instagram so go check that out and write your message there your story there and share it with other English learners and with me you'll find that at @reallife.english  and if you're an introvert like me you probably love reading and we have this other recent lesson that we made talking about six of the best books for English learners and for your life so go check that out now it's time to go beyond the classroom and live your English aww yeah! Now let's jump into this list of six incredible books for your English and your life.",
