            "text": " OK. Here's lecture sixteen and if you remember I ended up the last lecture with this formula for what I called a projection matrix. And maybe I could just recap for a minute what is that magic formula doing? For example, it's supposed to be -- it's supposed to produce a projection, if I multiply by a b, so I take P times b, I'm supposed to project that vector b to the nearest point in the column space. OK. Can I just -- one way to recap is to take the two extreme cases. Suppose a vector b is in the column space? Then what do I get when I apply the projection P? So I'm projecting into the column space but I'm starting with a vector in this case that's already in the column space, so of course when I project it I get B again, right. And I want to show you how that comes out of this formula. Let me do the other extreme.",

So what's the projection onto the plane, the nearest point in the plane, if the vector b that I'm looking at is -- got no component in the column space, it's sticking completely -- ninety degrees with it, then Pb should be zero, right. So those are the two extreme cases. The average vector has a component P in the column space and a component perpendicular to it, and what the projection does is it kills this part and it preserves this part. OK. Can we just see why that's true? Just -- that formula ought to work. So let me start with this one. What vectors are in the -- are perpendicular to the column space? How do I see that I really get zero? I have to think, what does it mean for a vector b to be perpendicular to the column space?

If I'm perpendicular to the column space, I'm in the null space of A transpose. OK. So if I'm in the null space of A transpose, and I multiply this big formula times b, so now I'm getting Pb, this is now the projection, Pb, do you see that I get zero? Of course I get zero. Right at the end there, A transpose b will give me zero right away. So that's why that zero's here. Because if I'm perpendicular to the column space, then I'm in the null space of A transpose and A transpose b is OK, what about the other possibility. zilch. How do I see that this formula gives me the right answer if b is in the column space? So what's a typical vector in the column space? It's a combination of the columns.

That makes it a combination of the columns. So these b's were in the null space of A transpose. These guys in the column space, those b's are Ax-s. Right? If b is in the column space then it has the form Ax. I'm going to stick that on the quiz or the final for sure. That you have to realize -- because we've said it like a thousand times that the things in the column space are vectors A times x. OK. And do you see what happens now if we use our formula? There's an A transpose A. Gets canceled by its inverse. We're left with an A times x. So the result was Ax. Which was b. Do you see that it works? This is that whole business. Cancel, cancel, leaving Ax. And Ax was b. So that turned out to be b, in this case. OK, so geometrically what we're seeing is we're taking a vector -- we've got the column space and perpendicular to that",

But they've got a best solution. What do I mean by best solution? So let me take time out to remember what I'm talking about for best solution. So this is my equation Ax=b. A is this matrix, one, one, one, one, two, three. x is my -- only have two unknowns, C and D, and b is my right-hand side, one, two, three. OK. No solution. Three eq- I have a three by two matrix, I do have two independent columns -- so I do have a basis for the column space, those two columns are independent, they're a basis for the column space, but the column space doesn't include that vector.

And same at points two and same at points three. OK, so what's up? What's up with those Ps? P1, P2, P3, what are they? They're the components, they lie on the line, right? They're the points which if instead of one, two, two, which were the b's, suppose I put P1, P2, P3 in here. I'll figure out in a minute what those numbers are. But I just want to get the picture of what I'm doing. If I put P1, P2, P3 in those three equations, what would be good about the three equations? I could solve them. A line goes through the Ps. So the P1, P2, P3 vector, that's in the column space. That is a combination of these columns. It's the closest combination. It's this picture. See, I've got the two pictures like here's the picture that shows the points, this is a picture in a blackboard plane, here's a picture that's showing the vectors.",

I would like to -- I'd like to find these equations from calculus. I'd like to find them from this minimizing thing. So what's the first error? The first error is what I missed by in the first equation. C plus D minus one squared. And the second error is what I miss in the second equation. C plus two D minus two squared. And the third error squared is C plus three D minus two squared. That's my -- overall squared error that I'm trying to minimize. OK. So how would you minimize that? OK, linear algebra has given us the equations for the minimum. But we could use calculus too. That's a function of two variables, C and D, and we're looking for the minimum. So how do we find it?",

Take the partial derivative with respect -- I'm not going to write it all out, just -- you will. The partial derivative with respect to D, it -- you know, it's going to be linear, that's the beauty of these squares,that if I have the square of something and I take its derivative I get something And this is what I get. linear. So this is the derivative of the error with respect to C being zero, and this is the derivative of the error with respect to D being zero. Wherever you look, these equations keep coming. So now I guess I'm going to solve it, what will I do, I'll subtract, I'll do elimination of course, because that's the only thing I know how to do. Two of these away from this would give me -- let's see, six, so would that be two Ds equals one? Ha. So it wasn't -- I was afraid these numbers were going to come out awful. But if I take two of those away from that, the equation I get left is two D equals one, so I think D is a half and C is whatever back substitution gives, six D is three, so three C plus three",

Let me write, let me copy that best line down again, two-thirds and a half. Let me -- I'll put in the two-thirds and the half. OK. So what's this P1, that's the value at t equal to one. At t equal to one, I have two-thirds plus a half, which is -- what's that, four-sixths and three-sixths, so P1, oh, I promised not to write another thing on this -- I'll erase P1 and I'll put seven-sixths.

Well, maybe I have the signs of e wrong, I think I have, let me fix it. Because I would like this one-sixth -- I would like this plus the P to give the original b. I want P plus e to match b. So I want minus a sixth, plus seven-sixths to give the correct b equal one. OK. Now -- I'm going to take a deep breath here, and ask what do we know about this error vector e? You've seen now this whole problem worked completely through, and I even think the numbers are right. So there's P, so let me -- I'll write -- if I can put it down here, B is P plus e. b I believe was one, two, two. The nearest point had seven-sixths,",

What else about those two vectors, the P, the projection vector P, and the error vector e. What else do you know about them? They're perpendicular, right. Do we dare verify that? Can you take the dot product of those vectors? I'm like getting like minus seven over thirty-six, can I change that to ten-sixths? Oh, God, come out right here. Minus seven over thirty-six, plus twenty over thirty-six, minus thirteen over thirty-six. Thank you, God. OK. And what else should we know about that vector?",

The picture here for vectors and, the picture here for the best line, and it's the same picture, just -- this one's in the plane and it's showing the line, this one never did show the line, this -- in this picture, C and D never showed up. In this picture, C and D were -- you know, they determined that line. But the two are exactly the same. C and D is the combination of the two columns that gives P. OK. So that's these squares. And the special but most important example of fitting by straight line, so the homework that's coming then Wednesday asks you to fit by straight lines. So you're just going to end up solving the key equation. You're going to end up solving that key equation and then P will be Ax hat. That's it. OK.

Is that right, that's what we worked in the previous chapter to understand, that a matrix was invertible when its null space is only the zero vector. So that's what I want to show. How come if A transpose Ax is zero, how come x must be zero? What's going to be the reason? Actually I have two ways to do it. Let me show you one way. This is -- here, trick. Take the dot product of both sides with x. So I'll multiply both sides by x transpose. x transpose A transpose Ax equals zero.",

So that's the argument and you see how it really used our understanding of the -- of the null space. OK. That's great. All right. So where are we then? That board is like the backup theory that tells me that this matrix had to be invertible because these columns were independent.

That is our absolute favorite pair of orthonormal vectors. They're both unit vectors and they're perpendicular. That angle is ninety degrees. So like our job next time is first to see why orthonormal vectors are great, and then to make vectors orthonormal by picking the right basis. OK, see you. Thanks.",
