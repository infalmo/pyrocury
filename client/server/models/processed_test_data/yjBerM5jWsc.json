[{"text": " OK, this is linear algebra lecture nine.

And emphasize that we talk about a bunch of vectors being independent. Wouldn't talk about a matrix being independent. A bunch of vectors being independent. A bunch of vectors spanning a space. A bunch of vectors being a basis. And the dimension is some number. OK, so what are the definitions?

The conclusion is there are some non-zero x-s such that Ax is zero. There are some special solutions. And why? We know why. I mean, it sort of like seems like a reasonable thing, more unknowns than equations, then it seems reasonable that we can solve them.

OK. I'll give you the full definition. These are just vectors in some vector space. I can take combinations of them. The question is, do any combinations give zero?

If not, then the vectors are independent. If some other combination does give zero, the vectors are dependent. OK. Let's just take examples. Suppose I'm in, say, in two dimensional space. OK.

Of course those are dependent, because two of these first vectors minus the second vector is zero. That's a combination of these two vectors that gives the zero vector. OK, that was clear. Suppose, suppose I have a vector -- here's another example. It's easy example. Suppose I have a vector and the other guy is the zero vector. Suppose I have a vector V1 and V2 is the zero vector. Then are those vectors dependent or independent? They're dependent again. You could say, well, this guy is zero times that one. This one is some combination of those.

And now we're giving the official name, dependent if we do, independent if we don't. So I could express this in other words now. I could say the rank -- what's the rank in this independent case?

Yes, it is. And it's -- that will do. So what I've written there are actually the two special solutions, right? I took the two free variables, free and free. I gave them the values 1 0 or 0 I figured out the rest. So do you see, let me just say it in words. This vector, these vectors in the null space are telling me, they're telling me the combinations", "start": 2790.0, "heat": 0.506}, {"text": " of the columns that give zero. They're telling me in what way the, the columns are dependent. That's what the null space is doing. Have I got enough now? And what's the null space now? We have to think about the null space. These are two vectors in the null space. They're independent. Are they a basis for the null space? What's the dimension of the null space? You see that those questions just keep coming up all the time. Are they a basis for the null space? You can tell me the answer even though we haven't written out a proof of that. Can you? Yes or no? Do these two special solutions form a basis for the null space? In other words, does the null space consist of all combinations of those two guys? Yes or no? Yes. Yes. The null space is two dimensional. The null space, the dimension of the null space, is the number of free variables. So the dimension of the null space is the number of free variables. And at the last second, give me the formula. This is then the key formula that we know. How many free variables are there in terms of R, the rank, m -- the number of rows, n, the number of columns?", "start": 2880.0, "heat": 0.61}, {"text": " What do we get? We have n columns, r of them are pivot columns, so n-r is the number of free columns, free variables. And now it's the dimension of the null space. OK. That's great. That's the key spaces, their bases, and their dimensions. Thanks.", "start": 2970.0, "heat": 0.426}]
