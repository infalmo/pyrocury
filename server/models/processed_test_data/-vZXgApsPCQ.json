OK, why don't you\ngo get your gift and sit down.So behave next year --someone might say\nsomething nice about you.\"(Laughter)Well, as I'm describing this you,you probably know\nI remember this really well.(Laughter)But I don't know who felt worse that day.Was it me or the teacher?She must have realized\nthat she turned a team-building eventinto a public roast\nfor three six-year-olds.And without the humor.You know, when you see\npeople get roasted on TV,it was funny.There was nothing funny about that day.So that was one version of me,and I would die to avoid\nbeing in that situation again --to get rejected in public again.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.805}, {"text": "That's one version.Then fast-forward eight years.Bill Gates came to my hometown --Beijing, China --to speak,and I saw his message.I fell in love with that guy.I thought, wow,\nI know what I want to do now.That night I wrote a letter to my familytelling them: \"By age 25,I will build the biggest\ncompany in the world,and that company will buy Microsoft.\"(Laughter)I totally embraced this idea\nof conquering the world --domination, right?And I didn't make this up,\nI did write that letter.And here it is --(Laughter)You don't have to read this through --(Laughter)This is also bad handwriting,\nbut I did highlight some key words.You get the idea.(Laughter)So ...that was another version of me:one who will conquer the world.Well, then two years later,I was presented with the opportunity\nto come to the United States.I jumped on it,because that was\nwhere Bill Gates lived, right?(Laughter)I thought that was the start\nof my entrepreneur journey.Then, fast-forward another 14 years.I was 30.Nope, I didn't build that company.I didn't even start.I was actually a marketing manager\nfor a Fortune 500 company.And I felt I was stuck;I was stagnant.Why is that?Where is that 14-year-old\nwho wrote that letter?It's not because he didn't try.It's because every time I had a new idea,every time I wanted to try something new,even at work --I wanted to make a proposal,I wanted to speak up\nin front of people in a group --I felt there was this constant battlebetween the 14-year-old\nand the six-year-old.One wanted to conquer the world --make a difference --another was afraid of rejection.And every time that six-year-old won.And this fear even persisted\nafter I started my own company.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.758}, {"text": "I mean, I started\nmy own company when I was 30 --if you want to be Bill Gates,you've got to start\nsooner or later, right?When I was an entrepreneur,I was presented\nwith an investment opportunity,and then I was turned down.And that rejection hurt me.It hurt me so bad\nthat I wanted to quit right there.But then I thought,hey, would Bill Gates quit\nafter a simple investment rejection?Would any successful\nentrepreneur quit like that?No way.And this is where it clicked for me.OK, I can build a better company.I can build a better\nteam or better product,but one thing for sure:I've got to be a better leader.I've got to be a better person.I cannot let that six-year-old\nkeep dictating my life anymore.I have to put him back in his place.So this is where I went online\nand looked for help.Google was my friend.(Laughter)I searched, \"How do I overcome\nthe fear of rejection?\"I came up with a bunch\nof psychology articlesabout where the fear\nand pain are coming from.Then I came up with a bunch\nof \"rah-rah\" inspirational articlesabout \"Don't take it personally,\njust overcome it.\"Who doesn't know that?(Laughter)But why was I still so scared?Then I found this website by luck.It's called rejectiontherapy.com.(Laughter)\"Rejection Therapy\" was this game\ninvented by this Canadian entrepreneur.His name is Jason Comely.And basically the idea is for 30 days\nyou go out and look for rejection,and every day get rejected at something,and then by the end,\nyou desensitize yourself from the pain.And I loved that idea.(Laughter)I said, \"You know what?\nI'm going to do this.And I'll feel myself\ngetting rejected 100 days.\"And I came up with my own rejection ideas,and I made a video blog out of it.And so here's what I did.This is what the blog looked like.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.914}, {"text": "Day One ...(Laughter)Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger.So this is where I went\nto where I was working.I came downstairsand I saw this big guy\nsitting behind a desk.He looked like a security guard.So I just approached him.And I was just walkingand that was the longest\nwalk of my life --hair on the back\nof my neck standing up,I was sweating and my heart was pounding.And I got there and said,\"Hey, sir, can I borrow\n100 dollars from you?\"(Laughter)And he looked up, he's like, \"No.\"\"Why?\"And I just said, \"No?

he invited me to explain myself.And I could've said many things.I could've explained,\nI could've negotiated.I didn't do any of that.All I did was run.I felt, wow, this is like\na microcosm of my life.Every time I felt the slightest rejection,I would just run as fast as I could.And you know what?The next day, no matter what happens,I'm not going to run.I'll stay engaged.Day Two: Request a \"burger refill.\"(Laughter)It's when I went to a burger joint,I finished lunch,\nand I went to the cashier and said,\"Hi, can I get a burger refill?\"(Laughter)He was all confused,\nlike, \"What's a burger refill?\"(Laughter)I said, \"Well, it's just like\na drink refill but with a burger.\"And he said, \"Sorry,\nwe don't do burger refill, man.\"(Laughter)So this is where rejection happened\nand

refill.(Laughter)I think they're still there.But the life and death feeling\nI was feeling the first timewas no longer there,just because I stayed engaged --because I didn't run.I said, \"Wow, great,\nI'm already learning things.Great.\"And then Day Three:\nGetting Olympic Doughnuts.This is where my life\nwas turned upside down.I went to a Krispy Kreme.It's a doughnut shopin mainly the Southeastern part\nof the United States.I'm sure they have some here, too.And I went in,I said, \"Can you make me doughnuts\nthat look like Olympic symbols?Basically, you interlink\nfive doughnuts together ... \"I mean there's no way\nthey could say yes, right?The doughnut maker took me so seriously.(Laughter)So she put out paper,started jotting down\nthe colors and the rings,and is like, \"How can I make this?\"And then 15 minutes later,she came out with a box\nthat looked like Olympic rings.And I was so touched.I just couldn't believe it.And that video got\nover five million views on Youtube.The world couldn't believe that either.(Laughter)You know, because of that\nI was in newspapers,in talk shows, in everything.And I became famous.A lot of people\nstarted writing emails to meand saying, \"What you're\ndoing is awesome.\"But you know, fame and notoriety\ndid not do anything to me.What I really wanted to do was learn,and to change myself.So I turned the rest\nof my 100 days of rejectioninto this playground --into this research project.I wanted to see what I could learn.And then I learned a lot of things.I discovered so many secrets.For example, I found if I just don't run,", "start": 480.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "if I got rejected,I could actually turn a \"no\" into a \"yes,\"and the magic word is, \"why.\"So one day I went to a stranger's house,\nI had this flower in my hand,knocked on the door and said,\"Hey, can I plant this flower\nin your backyard?\"(Laughter)And he said, \"No.\"But before he could leave I said,\"Hey, can I know why?\"And he said, \"Well, I have this dogthat would dig up\nanything I put in the backyard.I don't want to waste your flower.If you want to do this,\ngo across the street and talk to Connie.She loves flowers.\"So that's what I did.I went across and knocked\non Connie's door.And she was so happy to see me.(Laughter)And then half an hour later,there was this flower\nin Connie's backyard.I'm sure it looks better now.(Laughter)But had I left\nafter the initial rejection,I would've thought,well, it's because\nthe guy didn't trust me,it's because I was crazy,because I didn't dress up well,\nI didn't look good.It was none of those.It was because what I offered\ndid not fit what he wanted.And he trusted me enough\nto offer me a referral,using a sales term.I converted a referral.Then one day --and I also learned that I can\nactually say certain thingsand maximize my chance to get a yes.So for example,\none day I went to a Starbucks,and asked the manager,\n\"Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?\"He was like, \"What's a Starbucks greeter?\"I said, \"Do you know\nthose Walmart greeters?You know, those people who say\n'hi' to you before you walk in the store,and make sure you\ndon't steal stuff, basically?I want to give a Walmart experience\nto Starbucks customers.\"(Laughter)Well, I'm not sure\nthat's a good thing, actually --Actually, I'm pretty sure\nit's a bad thing.And he was like, \"Oh\" --yeah, this is how he looked,\nhis name is Eric --and he was like, \"I'm not sure.\"This is how he was hearing me. \"Not sure.\"Then I ask him, \"Is that weird?\"He's like, \"Yeah, it's really weird, man.\"But as soon as he said that,\nhis whole demeanor changed.It's as if he's putting\nall the doubt on the floor.And he said, \"Yeah, you can do this,", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.874}, {"text": "just don't get too weird.\"(Laughter)So for the next hour\nI was the Starbucks greeter.I said \"hi\" to every customer\nthat walked in,and gave them holiday cheers.By the way, I don't know\nwhat your career trajectory is,don't be a greeter.(Laughter)It was really boring.But then I found I could do this\nbecause I mentioned, \"Is that weird?\"I mentioned the doubt that he was having.And because I mentioned, \"Is that weird?\",\nthat means I wasn't weird.That means I was actually\nthinking just like him,seeing this as a weird thing.And again, and again,I learned that if I mention\nsome doubt people might havebefore I ask the question,I gained their trust.People were more likely to say yes to me.And then I learned\nI could fulfill my life dream ...by asking.You know, I came\nfrom four generations of teachers,and my grandma has always told me,\"Hey Jia, you can do anything you want,but it'd be great\nif you became a teacher.\"(Laughter)But I wanted to be\nan entrepreneur, so I didn't.But it has always been my dream\nto actually teach something.So I said, \"What if I just askand teach a college class?\"I lived in Austin at the time,so I went to University\nof Texas at Austinand knocked on professors' doors\nand said, \"Can I teach your class?\"I didn't get anywhere\nthe first couple of times.But because I didn't run --\nI kept doing it --and on the third try\nthe professor was very impressed.He was like, \"No one\nhas done this before.\"And I came in prepared\nwith powerpoints and my lesson.He said, \"Wow, I can use this.Why don't you come back in two months?\nI'll fit you in my curriculum.\"And two months later\nI was teaching a class.This is me -- you probably can't see,\nthis is a bad picture.You know, sometimes you get\nrejected by lighting, you know?(Laughter)But wow --when I finished teaching that class,\nI walked out crying,because I thoughtI could fulfill my life dream\njust by simply asking.I used to think I have to accomplish\nall these things --have to be a great entrepreneur,\nor get a PhD to teach --", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.546}, {"text": "but no, I just asked,and I could teach.And in that picture,\nwhich you can't see,I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr.Why? Because in my research I found\nthat people who really change the world,who change the way we live\nand the way we think,are the people who were met\nwith initial and often violent rejections.People like Martin Luther King, Jr.,like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,or even Jesus Christ.These people did not\nlet rejection define them.They let their own reaction\nafter rejection define themselves.And they embraced rejection.And we don't have to be those people\nto learn about rejection,and in my case,rejection was my curse,was my boogeyman.It has bothered me my whole life\nbecause I was running away from it.Then I started embracing it.I turned that into\nthe biggest gift in my life.I started teaching people\nhow to turn rejections into opportunities.I use my blog, I use my talk,I use the book I just published,and I'm even building technology to help\npeople overcome their fear of rejection.When you get rejected in life,when you are facing the next obstacleor next failure,consider the possibilities.Don't run.If you just embrace them,they might become your gifts as well.Thank you.(Applause)", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.608}]
