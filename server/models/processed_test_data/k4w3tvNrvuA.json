responsiblefor some pretty atrocious vocalperformances looking back at it nowthere were some very obvious mistakesthat i was making and they're the thingsthat i want to help you with today i'mnot a singing teacher i have had somesinging lessons over the years and forsome really super duper singing teachersvocal coachesbut i found with a lot of singingteachers they're teaching you to singlike high level to beyou know aware of your breathingsupporting your diaphragm making sureyou're aware of the breaks in your voiceand where it breaks and uh singingexercises and vocal warm-ups and all ofthat sort of stuff and to be honestthat's not the sort of thing that ireally wanted to do i wanted to be ableto sing well enough to sing a song thati've written and sing it in tune and beable to sing a youtube video and it notsuck because some of the vocals that idid were pretty appalling and peoplereally piled onto me andwhen you get loads of negative feedbackon stuff it ruins your confidence andthat makes you you know less able tosing souh what i want to share with you is notthe sort of stuff that you'd get from avocal teacher maybe some of it would bebut i want to go from like the verybeginning uh people that are scared notsure if they're in tune or not and thentalk a little bit about the things thatwere really important for me like how tofind a wayfor my to use my voice in a way thatfelt good for me to try and make thevoice sound like what i wanted it tosound like without being told that i'vegot to sing like this and stand likethis with this posture and if you wantto be a great singer then that stuff'simportant if you want to sing vocallyreally challenging material then thosethings are pretty important but that'snot probably i think the right place tostart you want to start with just beingable to sing in tune being able to singa song that you enjoy singing and thentrying to actually you know developenough confidence to be able to play for", "start": 0.0, "heat":

just puta little post up on instagram asking forquestions about singing and by far themost common thing was people worriedabout being able to sing in tune sowe're going to start with that one i'mgoing to try and answer pretty much allof the questions that were on that andas well the the structure that i'd kindof thought of before that i think is agood way to progress with your singingso the first thing singing a note intune how does that work now i think areally good starting point is just toplay a note on the guitar and then tryand sing that pitch you probably don'twant to start too high you don't want tostart with thisno which would probably be difficulteven for a great singer so a good onethat seems to work well for most boysand girls but feel free to change it ifyou find it like range-wise difficult tosing would bethe note c it's the third fret of thefifth string okay so just play that noteand then try and sing it so you're hereor whatever whatever sound it doesn'treally matter it's just about trying tofind the pitch right so i'm going tostick with ours for the timeand we find another note so justsomewhere around the thing go a littlebit lower a little bit higher i'm justgonna pick this the fourth fret of thefourth string[Music]when you first start doing this it'slikely to be a little bit more like youfind the notemight take a few goes don't worry aboutit when you're learning a new skill it'scompletely normal to suck at it when youfirst start just get over it you need tokeep practicing it the more times you doit the more the quicker you'll find theright

what exactly what i meanso uh it wouldn't really matter thetuner by the way butso i'm playing the note c and i can tellthat it's the note c because it'll showme on the tuner right then i'm going totry and sing that notenow you can see it's kind of wobblingaround a little bitbut you can get to the point where it'llstay roughly in tune and that's the keything okay so let's pick another noteit's the note gstaying there but voices tend to have anatural vibrato to it so that's why thethe tune is unlikely to be locked in asmuch as it would for for a guitar tryd sharp and they'll now try and go alittle bit deliberately wonky and thenget to usand we pretty much got there in the endso the thing about doing that is thatit's about developing the confidence inyour ability to find a pitch because ifyou can't find a picture or you're veryunlikely to be able to find a pitch inthe song now there are somesurrounding circumstances that you mightfind here that it's often easier to finda note like that if it's part of a chordthat you're playing so you might findthat you're going to go for this noteit's a little bit high but whateverit'll be easier if i put it in a chordbecause the rest of the

hadto really sing loudly i was reallytrying to project and give it you knowsing with a lot of volume and one of thethings that i noticed when i decidedthat i wanted to try and work on mysinging a bit was that the great singersthat i really liked when i was watchinglike james taylor or uh chris cornell orwhatever sting they never looked likethey were straining well maybeoccasionally when they're really goingfor a note but most of the time theylooked kind of relaxed especially jamestaylor lookshe doesn't even seem to open his mouthand that was the first twinge that i gotthat a lot of the singing teacher stuffthat i'd seen before about posture andsitting up straight and opening yourmouth and ah i'm projecting and all ofthis stuffi'm not sure the guys that i reallyliked didn't seem to do thatthat didn't seem to be part of the plannow i'm like well maybe i don't have todo that so i started experimenting withsinging a lot quieter a lot quieter andit made so much more sense and suddenlymy voice i could sing in tune better iwasn't running out of breath because theother thing when you go when you singreally loud you use a lot more breathand that's one of those instances whereyou need to be thinking about yourbreathing and your diaphragm and yourposture you need lots of air in yourlungs all of that sort of stuff but ifyou if you're singing a little softeryou don't need as much air and suddenlyit just made so much more sense the toneof my voice dramatically improveddramatic like overnight i went from likealways sounding like i was straining ina bit of a struggle

more softly and justtryto singquietly andintothink about it like that rather thantrying to betoo loud andbecause as soon as you go up and you'resinging in it's all getting strained itjust doesn't it'si mean sometimes that's necessary and itdepends again a little bit on the stylethat you're doing and stuff like thatbut sometimes that really straining fora note is really passionate andyou can learn to do that i'm sure thatthere are ways of learning that stuffbut for most times you don't that's nota good place to start i feel likesometimes now i can strain a bit andreach for stuffbut i'm

about singersokay it might not matter so much at abig concert because hopefully the vocalperformance is on par but if you go tolike an open mikey thing you will findsingers that you don't really rate thatmuch that aren't gelling with you sowork out what it is don't tell themdon't go up to the end of the thing andgo hey i didn't like your vocalperformance because that would just makeyou not a very nice human right but beaware of it yourself listen to themthink oh god the way they sing that holdthat note and it kind of goes out oftune toward the end it really doesn'tsound very good or they're they'rereally lacking in confidence there sothat's that's not going to work thatit's so like being confident is part ofthis whole thingit's a really big part of singing iscurrently is your

that you've gota problem with pitch you're never goingto fix it if you don't know that yourvibrato sucks you're never going to fixit so recording yourself is the key forthat now i have to do it all the timei'm recording myselfmost days i'm recording myself singingsomething and i'm i have to listen backto it and that was one of those thingsthat especially around this time where iwent from trying to strain all the timeto chilling the volume right down andgetting it more in touch with that icould hear that it got better straightaway and that helped with the confidencebecause when you hear it hear it gettingbetter all the time your confidencegrows so all the people saying hey i'mnot sure i'm never confident to sing infront of my family i worry about singingin front of my friends or

nottouting myself as a singer i feel likeit's a really beneficial thing to beable to see the the uh song played inthe context with a vocal rather thanjust the guitar on its own i feel likethat's hard tosee the song in it sometimesparticularly songs where they've gotsimple chordsuh it also will help you with thingslike song dynamics which is something italk about quite often probably beyondhere but making sure your guitar islouder in the choruses and quieter inthe verses that kind of thing thatreally helps with the performance of asong something you would have alreadycovered in grade 3 if you've
