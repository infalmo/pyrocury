about the syllabusbefore going through the\nstructure of the course.So what I have written\nhere is a, kind of,rough definition of statistical\nmechanics from my perspective.And the syllabus\nis a guide to howwe are going to\napproach this object.So let's take a look at\nthe syllabus over there.So the first thing that\nyou're going to focus onis, what is it that\nyou're trying to describe?And these are the\nequilibrium propertiesthat are described\nbest through whatI've been doing\nsection one, whichhas to do with thermodynamics.You'll start today\nwith thermodynamics.Basically, it's a\nphenomenological approach,so you essentially\nlook at something,as kind of a black\nbox, without knowingwhat the ingredients\nare, and tryto give some kind of\ndescription of how it'sfunction and properties change.And these can be captured, for\nthe case of thermal propertiesof matter through the laws of\nthermodynamics, which we willset out in this first section,\nwhich will roughly take usthe first four\nlectures of the course.Then I said that\nstatistical mechanicsis a probabilistic approach.So we need to establish what\nthe language of probability is.And that can be the\ntopic for the second two", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and half lectures of the course.It is something that is less\nphysics-y, but since the topicitself has to deal\nwith probabilities,it is very important,\nfrom my perspective,to set out the language and\nthe properties of systemsthat are described\nprobabilistically.Separately, we'll devote a\ncouple of lectures to do so.And in particular,\nit is very importantthat the laws of\nprobability, kind of,simplify when you're\ndealing with a large numberof variables, as captured,\nfor example, by what wecall the central limit theorem.So you can see that the\nthird element of this course,which is the law\nof large numbers,is inherent also to what\nsimplification you willsee in the section\non probability.And feeds back\nvery much into howstatistical mechanics\nis developed.But then we said large\nnumber of degrees of freedom.So what are these\ndegrees of freedom?Well, this is now taking\na different perspective.For us in\nthermodynamics, when youlook at the system\nas a black box,and try to develop laws\nbased on observations,we say that well, from the\nperspective of physics,we know that this box\ncontains atoms and molecules.And these atoms\nand molecules arefollowing very specific laws,\neither from Newtonian mechanicsor quantum mechanics.And so if we know everything\nabout how atoms and moleculesbehave, then we should\nbe able to derivehow large collections\nof them behave.And get the laws\nof thermodynamicsas a consequence of these\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.12}, {"text": "and their dynamics.And so that's what\nwe will discussin the third part\nof the course thatis devoted to kinetic theory.We will see that even at that\nstage, it is beneficial to,rather than follow individual\nparticles in a system,to adopt a\nprobabilistic approach,and think about densities,\nand how those densities evolveaccording to\nLiouville's Theorem.And what we will try\nto also establishis a very distinct\ndifference thatexists between\nthermodynamics, and wherethings are\nirreversible and goingone direction, and Newtonian,\nor quantum mechanics,where things are\nreversible in time.And we'll see that really\nit's a matter of adaptingthe right perspective in\norder to see that these twoways of looking\nat the same systemare not in contradiction.So having established\nthese elements,we will then finally\nbe in the placewhere we can discuss\nstatistical mechanics in termsof some postulates about\nhow probabilities behavefor systems that\nare in equilibrium.And how based on\nthose postulates,we can then derive all\nthe laws of thermodynamicsand all the properties of\nthermodynamics systems.That they're ordained\nwhile observationsand phenomenological\ntheories before.Now initially, in\nsection four, wewill do that in the context of\nclassical systems-- descriptionof particles following\nclassical laws of motion.And, again, as a\nfirst simplification,we will typically deal with\nnon-interacting systems,such as ideal gas.And make sure that we\nunderstand the propertiesof this important\nfundamental systemfrom all possible perspectives.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.104}, {"text": "Then in section five, we will\ngo on to more realistic systemswhere there are interactions\namong these particles.And there are two ways to\nthen deal with interactions.You can either go by the\nway of perturbation theory.We can start with ideal\nsystem and add a little bitof interaction, and see\nhow that changes things.And we develop some elements of\ngraphical perturbation theoriesin this context.Or, you can take\nanother perspective,and say that because of the\npresence of interactions,the system really adopts\na totally different typeof behavior.And there's a perspective\nknown as mean fieldtheory that allows\nyou to do that.Then see how the\nsame system can bepresent in different\nphases of matter,such as liquids and gas,\nand how this mean fieldtype of prescription\nallows you to discussthe transitions between the\ndifferent types of behavior.Eventually, you will go on,\ntowards the last quarterof the course, rather than the\nclassical description of matterto a quantum description of the\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom.And we will see how the\ndifferences and similaritiesbetween quantum\nstatistical mechanics,classical statistical\nmechanics, emerge.And just, historically,\nof course,radius macroscopic properties\nof the matter, the black bodylaws, or heat\ncapacities, have beenvery important in\nshowing the limitationsof classical description\nof matter, and the needto have something else, such\nas the quantum description.We will not spend too much\ntime, more than three lectures,on the sort of principles of\nquantum statistical mechanics.The place where quantum\nstatistical mechanics showsits power is in dealing with\nidentical particles, whichclassically, really\nare kind of nota very well-defined concept,\nbut quantum-mechanically, they", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.105}, {"text": "are very precisely defined,\nwhat identical particles mean.And there are two classes--\nfermions and bosons--and how even if there's no\ninteraction between them,quantum statistics leads to\nunusual behavior for quantumsystems of identical particles,\nvery distinct for fermionsand for bosons.So that's a rough syllables of\nhow the course will be arrangedover the next 25, 26 lectures.Any questions about what\nwe're going to cover?OK, then let's go here.So I will be\nteaching the course.My research is in\ncondensed matter theoryand statistical physics.So this is a subject\nthat I like very much.And I hope to impart\nsome of that loveof statistical physics to you.And why it is an\ninteresting topic.Lectures and recitations\nwill be conductedin this room, Monday,\nWednesday, Friday.And you ask, well, what does\nit mean that both lecturesand recitations are here?Well, for that you will have\nto consult the timetable.And that's probably\nthe most important partof this web page.And it tells you, for\nexample, that the first fiveevents for the\ncourse are all goingto be lectures Monday,\nWednesday, Friday of next week.And the first recitation will\ncome up on Monday, Septemberthe 16th.And the reason for that\nis that the first problemset will be due on the 18th.And I will arrange for you to\nhave six recitations on the sixevents that are before the due\ndates of those problem sets.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.103}, {"text": "Also indicated here is\nthe due dates, naturally,of the problem sets.And although I had indicated\nthat this will be handed outtomorrow, the first\nproblem set is alreadyavailable on the\nweb, so you can startgoing to take a look at

that is indicated,the solutions will be posted.Also indicated here is that\nthere will be various tests.The first test will\nfall on October 2.And another time\nand recitations willtake place are\nprior to the tests.So there is actually\nthree tests,and there will be\nthree citationsthat will take\nplace before that.And, ultimately, at the end,\nthere will be a final exam.It's date I don't know yet.So I just randomly put it\non the Monday of the weekwhere the final\nexams will be held.And once the actual date is\nannounced by the registrar,I will make sure that\nI put the correct dateand place in this place.OK, so that's the arrangement\nof the various lecturesand recitations.In addition to me,\nthe teaching staffconsists of Max [?

touchwith either the\nTAs, or myself, whenyou want to have\nspecific time to meet us.Otherwise, I have indicated\nmy own availabilityto be the half hours\ntypically after lectureson Monday, Wednesdays,\nand Fridays.One other set of\nimportant things to noteis how the course is organized.So I already mentioned to you\nwhat the syllabus of the courseis.I indicated where and when\nthe lectures and recitationsare going to take place.This is the web page that I\nhave been surfing through.And all of the material will\nbe posted through the web page,so that's where you have to go\nfor problem sets, solutions,et cetera.Also, grades.And, in particular,\nI have my own systemof posting the\ngrades, for which Ineed a pseudonym\nfrom each one of you.So if you could all go\nthrough this checking online,indicate your name,\nyour email address,and choose a pseudonym,\nwhich I emphasizehas to be different\nfrom your real name.And if it is your real name,\nI have to randomly come upwith something like \"forgot to\nput pseudonym\" or something.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "I cannot have your real\nname followed by the grades.OK?I'll discuss anonymous\ncomments, et cetera,

the notes and\nwhat you write in the lectures.But certainly, I--\nsome people liketo have a book sitting\non their bookshelf.So I have indicated\na set of booksthat you can put\non your bookshelf.And hopefully consult\nfor various topicsat different stages.And I will, through\nthe problem sets,indicate what are\ngood useful chaptersor parts of these books\nto take a look at.Now how is the grade for\nthe course constructed?An important part of it is\nthrough this six problem setsthat we mentioned.So each one of them\nwill count for 5%,for a total of 30% going towards\nthe contribution of the problemsets.I have no problem with\nyou forming study groups,as long as each person, at the\nend, writes their own solution.And I know that if you look\nat around sufficiently,you can find solutions from\nprevious years, et cetera,but you will really\nbe cheating yourself.And I really bring\nyour attentionto the code of honor that\nis part of the MIT integrityhandbook.We have indicated,\nthrough the schedule page,the timeline for this\nsix problem sets are due.They are typically\ndue at 5:00 PMon the date that is\nindicated on that page,and also on the problem set.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And the physics department\nwill set up a Dropbox,so you can put the\nproblem set there,or you can bring it to\nthe lecture on the datethat it is due.That's also acceptable.There is a

50%,rather than full\ntowards the grade.Unless you sort of write\nto me a good excusethat I can give\nyou an extension.Now every now and then,\npeople encounter difficulties,some particular week you are\noverwhelmed, or whatever,and you can't do the\nparticular problem set,and they ask me for an\nexcuse of some form.And rather than doing that,\nI have the following metric.That is, each one\nof these problemsets you will find that\nthere's a set of problemsthat are indicated as optional.You can do those problems.And they will be graded\nlike all the other problems.And in case, at\nsome later time, youdidn't hand in some\nproblem set, or youmiss half of the\nproblem set, et cetera,what you did on these\noptional problemscan be used to make up your\ngrade, pushing it, eventually,up to the 30% mark.If you don't do any of\nthe optional problems,you just do the\nrequired problem,you will correctly you\nwill reach the 30% mark.If you do every single problem,\nincluding optional ones,you will not get more than\n30%, so the 30% is upper-bound.So there's that.Then you have the\nthree tests thatwill be taking place during\nthe lecture time, 2:30 to 4:00,here.Each one of them will count\n15%, so that's another 45%.And the remaining 25%\nwill be the final exam", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "that will be scheduled\nin the finals week.So basically, that's the way\nthat the grades are made up.And the usual definition of\nwhat grades mean-- typically,we have been quite generous.I have to also indicate\nthat things will notbe graded on a curve.So that's a MIT policy.And there are some\nlinks here to placesthat you can go to if you\nencounter difficultiesduring the semester.So any questions about the\norganization of the course?OK, so let's see\nwhat else we have.OK, course outline and\nschedule, we already discussed.They're likely to be\nsomething that are unexpected,or some things that\nhave to be changed.Every now and then\nthere is goingto be a

it.But that's the way it\nis, so let me tell youhow it's going to be conducted.So you will have this one and\na half hour [INAUDIBLE] test.And I can tell you, that\nthe problems from the testwill be out of this collection\nthat I already posted here.So there is a\ncollection of problemsthat is posted on this page.And furthermore, the\nsolutions are posted.So there's a version of\nthis that is

this\ntable will be completed.And the only other thing to\nnote is that there's actuallygoing to be lecture notes\nfor the various materials,starting from the\nfirst lecture, thatwill be devoted\nto thermodynamics.Any questions?OK.So let me copy that\nfirst sentence,and we will go on and\ntalk about thermodynamics.The phenomenological description\nof equilibrium propertiesof microscopic

particular,\nthermodynamics, you say,is an old subject, and\nif you're ultimatelygoing to derive the\nlaws of thermodynamicsfrom some more precise\nmicroscopic description,why should we go\nthrough this exercise?The reason is that\nthere is reallya beautiful example\nof how you canlook at the system\nas a black box,and gradually, based\non observation,build a consistent\nmathematical frameworkto describe its properties.And it is useful\nin various branchesof science and physics.And kind of a more 20th century\nexample that I can think ofis, Landau's approach\nto superconductivityand

kinds of things\nthat superconductorsand superfluids could manifest.So let's sort of put\nyourselves, put ourselves,in the perspective of how\nthis science of thermodynamicswas developed.And this is at the time\nwhere Newtonian mechanics hadshown its power.It can describe orbits of\nthings going around the sun,and all kinds of other things.But that description,\nclearly, does notapply to very simple things like\nhow you heat up a pan of water.So there's some elements,\nincluding thermal properties,that are missing from\nthat description.And you would like to\ncomplete that theory,or develop a theory, that\nis able to describe alsoheat and thermal properties.So how do you go about that,\ngiven that your perspective isthe Newtonian prescription?So first thing to\nsort of a, kind of,parse among all of these\nelements, is system.So when describing\nNewtonian mechanics,you sort of idealize,\ncertainly yourealize that Newtonian mechanics\ndoes not describe thingsthat we see in everyday world.You kind of think\nabout point particleand how a point particle\nwould move in free space.And so let's try to do a similar\nthing for our kinds of systems.And the thing that is\ncausing us some difficultyis this issue of heat.And so what you can do\nis you can potentiallyisolate your system thermally\nby, what I would call,adiabatic laws.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text":

transfer.Let me choose a different color.Let's say green.So ultimately, I want to\nallow the exchange of whateverthis heat is in\nthermal propertiesto go and take place\nwith my system.OK?Now, this is\nbasically isolation.The next element is to\nwait for your systemto come to equilibrium.be You realize that when\nyou, for example, startwith something\nthat is like this,you change one of the walls\nto allow heat to go into it.Then the system\nundergoes some changes.Properties that you're\nmeasuring are notwell-defined over some\nperiod where these changestaking place, but if\nyou wait sufficiently,then they relax to\nsome new values.And then you can start\nmaking measurements.So this is when\nproperties don't change.And the key here is\nobservation time.This is part of\nthe

ones that are very\neasy for you to identifyare things that are associated\nwith mechanical work,or mechanical properties.And, for example, if you have\na box that contains a gas,you can immediately see well,\nwhat's the volume of the gas?You can calculate\nwhat pressure itis exerting on its environment.So this is for a gas.You could have, for\nexample, a wire.If you have a wire, you\ncould

thermal\naspects that youhaven't taken into account.And as of yet, you don't\nquite know what they are.And you have to gradually\nbuild upon those properties.So you have a system.These are kind of

the\nfollowing statement,if two systems-- let's call\nthem A and B-- are separatelyin equilibrium with C--\nwith a third system-- thenthey are in equilibrium\nwith each other.This is sort of

Let's say\nyour C is seawaterat some particular\nset of conditions.And so then, these\nare really constantsthat are appropriate\nto see water.And then you have\nchosen a function thatdepends on variables of A, of\ncourse of some function of B.Or you can say,\nwell, I can replacethis seawater by something else.And irrespective\nof what I choose,A and B, there by our definition\nin equilibrium with each other,no matter what I did with C.

can certainly exchange\none of these variablesfor temperature.So I can write,\nlet's say, pressureto be proportional to\ntemperature over volume.And then rewrite\nthis as a functionof temperature and volume.Now I know that in this\nprocess the volume changed,but the temperature\ndid not change.And therefore, the internal\nenergy that did not changecan only be a function\nof temperature.So this Joule expansion\nexperiment immediatelytells me that while internal\nenergy, in principle,", "start": 4920.0, "heat": 0.514}, {"text": "is a function of P\nand V, it is reallya function of the\nproduct of P and V,because the product\nof P and V, weestablished to be\nproportional to temperature.OK?So now if I go and look\nat these expressions,I can see that these, dE by\ndT, and irrespective of V and Pis the same thing, because E\nonly depends on temperature.And since V is-- we know that PV\nis proportional to temperature,a constant P, dV by dT\nis the same as V over T.And so if I look at the\ndifference between those twoexpressions, what I find\nis that this part cancels.This part gives me the value\nof this product, PV over T,which we said is a constant.And it is

two pathsis a constant.That constant is the same\nfor the same amount of gasfor different types of\nargon, krypton, et cetera.And since it is\nproportional, eventuallyto the amount of matter,\nwe will
