[{"text": "PROFESSOR: The\nidea of congruencewas introduced to\nthe world by Gaussin the early 18th century.You've heard of him\nbefore, I think.He's responsible for some\nwork on magnetism also.And it turns out that this\nidea, after several centuries,remains an active field of\napplication and research.And in particular,\nin computer scienceit's used significantly\nin crypto,which is what we're going to be\nleading up to now in this unit.It's plays a role\nin hashing, whichis a key method for\nmanaging data in memory.But we are not going to\ngo into that application.Anyway, the definition of\ncongruence is real simple.Congruence is a relation\nbetween two numbers, a and b.It's determined by\nanother parametern, where n is considered\nto be greater than one.All of these, as\nusual, are integers.And the definition\nis simply that ais congruent to b mod n if n\ndivides a minus b or a minusb is a multiple of n.So that's a key\ndefinition to remember.There's other ways to define it.We'll see very shortly\nan equivalent formulationthat could equally well have\nbeen used as a definition.But this is a standard one.A is equivalent to b means that\na minus b is a multiple of n.Well let's just practice.30 is equivalent to 12 mod\n9 because 30 minus 12 is 18,and 9 divides 18.OK.An immediate\napplication is that doesthis number with a lot\nof 6's is ending in a 3is equivalent to\n788253 modulo 10.Now why is that?Well, there's a\nvery simple reason.If you think about subtracting\nthe 6 number endingin 3 from the 7 number ending\nin 3, what you can immediatelysee without doing much of\nany of the subtraction--", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "just do the low order digits--\nwhen you subtract these,you're going to get a\nnumber that ends in 0.Which means that\nit's divisible by 10.And therefore those two\nnumbers are congruent.It's very easy to tell when\ntwo numbers are congruentmod 10 because they just\nhave the same lower digit.OK.Another way to understand\ncongruency and what it's reallyall about is the\nso-called remainder lemma,which sets that a is\ncongruent to b mod n, ifand only if a and b have the\nsame remainder on divisionby n.So let's work with\nthat definition.We can conclude using this\nformulation, equivalentformulation, that 30\nis equivalent to 12mod 9 because the remainder\nof 30 divided by 9,well it's 3 times 9\nis 27, remainder 3.And the remainder\nof 12 by 9 is 3.So they do indeed have\nthe same remainder 3.And they're congruent.By the way, this equivalent sign\nwith the three horizontal barsis read as both\nequivalent and congruent.And I will be bouncing back\nbetween the two pronunciationsindiscriminately.They are synonyms.OK, let's think about proving\nthis remainder lemma justfor practice.And in order to\nfit on the slide,I'm going to have to abbreviate\nthis idea of the remainder of bdivided by n with a\nshorter notation r sub b n.Just to fit.OK.So the if direction of\nproving the remainderlimit that they're congruent\nif and only if theyhave the same remainder.The if direction here\nin an if and only ifis from right to left.I've got to prove that if they\nhave the same remainder, thenthey're congruent.So there are the two\nnumbers, a and b.By the division theorem,\nor division algorithm,they can each be expressed as\na quotient of a divided by ntimes the quotient sub a plus\nthe remainder of a divided", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "by n.And likewise, b can\nbe expressed in termsof quotient and remainder.And what we're given here is\nthat the remainders are equal.But if the remainders\nare equal, then clearlywhen I subtract a minus b,\nI get qa minus qb times n.Sure enough, a minus\nb is a multiple of n.And that takes care of that one.The only if direction now\ngoes from left to right.So in the converse,\nI'm going to assumethat n divides a minus b,\nwhere a and b are expressedin this form by the division\nalgorithm or division theorem.So if n divides a minus\nb, looking at a minus bin that form what we're\nseeing is that n dividesthis qa minus qb times\nn, plus the differenceof the remainders.That's what I get just\nby subtracting a and b.But if you look at this\nn divides that term,the quotient times n.And it therefore has to\ndivide the other term as well.Because the only way\nthat n can dividea sum, when it divides\none of the sum ands,is if it divides\nthe other sum and.So n divides ra minus the\nremainder of 8 divided by nfrom b divided by n.But remember, these\nare remainders.So that means that they're\nboth in the interval from 0to n minus 1 inclusive.And the distance between them\nhas got to be less than 1.So if n divides a number\nthat's between 0 and n minus 1,that number has to be 0.Because it's the only number\nthat n divides in there.So in fact, the difference\nof the remainders is 0.And therefore, the\nremainders are equal.And we've knocked that one off.So there it is restated.The remainder lemma says\nthat they're congruent ifand only if they have\nthe same remainders.And that's worth\nputting a box around", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "to highlight this\ncrucial fact, whichcould equally well have used as\nthe definition of congruence.And then you'd prove\nthe division definitionthat we began with.Now some immediate consequences\nof this remainder lemmaare that a congruence inherits\na lot of properties of equality.Because it means\nnothing more than thatthe remainders are equal.So for example, we can say\nthe congruence is symmetric,meaning that if a is congruent\nto b, then b is congruent to a.And that's obvious\ncause a congruent to bmeans that a and b have\nthe same remainder.So b and a have\nthe same remainder.One that would actually\ntake a little bit of workto prove from the\ndivision definition--not a lot, but a\nlittle bit-- wouldbe that if a is congruent to b,\nand b is congruent to c, then ais congruent to c.But we can read it is saying\nthe first says that a and b havethe same remainder.The second says that b and\nc have the same remainder.So obviously a and c\nhave the same remainder.And we've prove this\nproperty that's knownas transitivity of congruence.Another simple consequence\nof the remainder theoremis a little technical\nresult that'senormously useful called\nremainder lemma, whichsays simply that a number is\ncongruent to its own remainder,modulo n.The proof is easy.Let's prove it by showing\nthat a and the remainder of ahave the same remainder.Well, what if I take\nremainders of both sides,the left hand side becomes the\nremainder of a divided by n.The right hand side is the\nremainder of the remainder.But the point is\nthat the remainderis in the interval from 0 to n.And that means when you take its\nremainder mod and its itself.And therefore the left\nhand side is the remainderof a divided by n, and\nthe right hand sideis also the remainder\nof the a divided by n.And we have proved\nthis corollarythat's the basis of\nremainder arithmetic.Which will basically\nallow us whenever", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "we feel like it to replace\nnumbers by their remainders,and that way keep\nthe numbers small.And that also\nmerits a highlight.OK.Now, in addition to these\nproperties like equalitythat congruence has, it\nalso interacts very wellthe operations.Which is why it's\ncalled a congruence.A congruence is an\nequality-like relationthat respects the\noperations thatare relevant to the discussion.In this case, we're going to be\ntalking about plus and times.And the first fact\nabout congruentsays that if a and\nb are congruent,then a plus c and b\nplus c are congruent.The proof of that follows\ntrivially from the definition.Because the a\ncongruent to b mod,n says that n divides a minus b.And if n divides a minus b,\nobviously n divides a plusc minus b plus c.Because a plus c minus b\nplus c is equal to a minus b.That one is deceptively trivial.It's also the case that if a\nis congruent to b, then a timesc is congruent to b times c.This one takes a one line proof.We're given that n\ndivides a minus b.That certainly\nimplies that n dividesany multiple of a minus b.So multiply it by c and\nthen apply distributivity,and you discover\nthat n divides acminus bc, which means ac is\ncongruent to bc modulo n.It's a small step\nthat I'm going to omitto go from adding\nthe same constantto both sides to adding\nany two congruentnumbers to the same sides.So if a is congruent to b\nand c is congruent to d, thenin fact, a plus c is\ncongruent to b plus d.So again, congruence is acting\na lot like ordinary equality.If you add equals to\nequals, you get equals.And of course the same fact\napplies to multiplication.If you multiply equals by\nequals, you get equals.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "A corollary of this is that\nif I have two numbers thatare congruent modulo n, then if\nI have any kind of arithmeticformula involving plus\nand times and minus--and what I want to know is what\nit's equivalent to modulo n--I can figure that out\nfreely substitutinga by a prime or a prime by a.I can replace any number by a\nnumber that it's congruent to,and the final congruence\nresult of the formulais going to remain unchanged.So overall what this shows is\nthat arithmetic modulo n isa lot like ordinary arithmetic.And the other\ncrucial point thoughtthat follows from this\nfact about remaindersis that because a is congruent\nto the remainder of a dividedby n, then when I'm doing\narithmetic on congruences,I can always keep the numbers\ninvolved in the remainderinterval.That is, in the remainder\nrange from 0 to n minus 1.And we use this standard closed\nopen interval notation to meanthe interval from 0 to n.So it's sometimes\nused in analysisto mean the real\ninterval of reals.But we're always\ntalking about integers.So this means-- the\nintegers that square bracketmeans 0 is included.And a round parenthesis\nmeans that n is excluded.So that's exactly a description\nof the integers thatare greater and equal\nto 0 and less than n.Let's do an application of\nthis remainder arithmetic idea.Suppose I want to figure out\nwhat's 287 to the ninth powermodulo 4?Well, for a start but if I\ntake the remainder of 287divided by 4, it's not very\nhard to check

the\nexponent, and replaced itjust by a one digit number, 3.That's progress.Well, we can make more\nprogress because 3 to the ninthcan be expressed as 3 squared,\nsquared, squared times 3,right?Because when you\niterate taking powers,it means that the\nexponents multiply.So this is 3 to the 2 times\n2 times 2, or 8, times 3--which adds 1 to the\nexponent-- or 9.So that's simple\nexponent arithmetic.But notice that 3 squared is 9.And 9 is congruent to 1 mod 4.So that means I can\nreplace 3 squared by 1,and the outer 2 squared stays.It becomes 1 squared squared,\nbut that's 1 times 3.And the punchline is that 287 to\nthe ninth is congruent to 3 mod4 by a really easy calculation\nthat did not involve takinganything to the ninth power.", "start": 720.0, "heat":
