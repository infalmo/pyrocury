at Goldman Sachs.One of the last things I did as\nkind of the cofinance officerwas also sit on the\nfirm-wide risk committee.And so sort of\nbringing insight into,what is risk\nmanagement in finance?Or at least in the capital\nmarket side of finance.And crises.I'm going to spend a couple\nof minutes on the OA crisis.Some perspective from a\nguy who lived through it.And then some of\nthe

that that act in 1994\nthat essentially caused--it was the catalyst for\njust massive consolidationof the financial\nservices industry.And so that's what ultimately\nled to disproportionate wages,or disproportionate\neconomic rents,when related to productivity.GARY GENSLER: OK.So can you remind me which act?Because '94 isn't\nringing a bell.I mean, the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley was 1999,and I don't know if there\nwas something in '94 that--[INTERPOSING VOICES]GARY GENSLER: What's that?STUDENT: Riegle-Neal.GARY GENSLER: Riegle-Neal.OK.So Dan's raising that it's\nalso regulation and lawhas a lot of effect on it.Consolidation is happening\nin many industries.Finance is not separate\nfrom those industries.50, 60 years ago, you\nhad the local drugstores,now we have the big chains\nlike CVS and the like.So I just mention that the\nconsolidation happens a lot.One thing that I would say\non the other side of that,having actually watched\nand observed some of it,is there was the desire\nto merge a lot of banking.But the US, in contrast\nto other countries,didn't have interstate banking.All the way into\nthe 1970s, bankshad to be within their own--one of the 50 states, literally.That started to break\ndown in the late '70s.It started-- Riegle Neal in\n'94, pretty much then it was,Katie bar the door, we\ncould have national banking.And then by 1999,\nwe also could havecommercial

monopolisticrents?And I'm just discerning\nthe word manipulation--STUDENT: Yeah.I guess what they were--yeah, I mean I think it's--I mean manipulation in\nthe sense that, higher--maybe taking advantage\nin a way thatwouldn't exist in a market\nthat wasn't so consolidatedcompared to other markets\nthat were consolidatedand regulated, such as Canada.Because he made a\nlot [INAUDIBLE]..GARY GENSLER: I would note that\nevery entrepreneur's desire,in a business context,\nmaybe not in a moral sense,is to be able to\ncollect economic rents.Like you start out\nas a disruptor,and along the journey,\nyou would actuallywish to become somebody\nwho collects excess profitsor becomes the monopolist.I'm not speaking\nthat you literallywant to take\nadvantage of people,but you do want to sort\nof collect excess rents.And so it's a sort of\nnatural transformation.I'm sorry, there\nwas a hand here.STUDENT: Yeah, similar to what\nEric said last, compare also--concentration by\nregulation, or concentrationby deregulating the market,\nand by regulating it,incumbents are able\nto take more risks.And that is bad for\nfinancial systems.GARY GENSLER: Right.Brotish?STUDENT: Not from the paper,\nmore from personal experience.So the way I see it is\nthe financial institutionsare increasingly trying\nto be at the centerof a lot of\ndifferent [INAUDIBLE]of different business.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And with many\ninnovative products,they are kind of connected\nlike people across the industrychain.So they kind of [INAUDIBLE]\nsome sort of accountabilitywith [INAUDIBLE] valuations.And when a financial\ninstitution is at risk,it connects all the different\nplayers in the value chain.GARY GENSLER: Right.So Brotish is raising also\nthat finance, partly becauseof its centrality\nin the economy,tries to add other products\nor add other thingsand be at the center of the\nvalue proposition or chain.I would contend there is\nalso non-financial firms thattry to do the same\nthing into finance.So big tech right now--you think about Apple Pay,\nor think of Alibaba in China.But then Ant Financial is\none of the most significant.So sometimes it\ncomes the other way.If you can leverage a network,\nleverage your centralityto a market and add products.But I agree with you, it\ngoes both ways, though.Other comments\nfrom the readings?Isabella?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]\narticles alsowas sort of the idea of\ninnovation ahead of regulation.The nice thing about\nbringing in new technologyis that it does take\ntime for the governmentto actually regulate it.And I know one of the\narticles, or the interviewtalked about needing to further\nregulate and restructurethe banks.That's not something that's\ngoing to happen, especiallywith people trying to overturn--\nis it the Dodd-Frank act?Yes.So it's not really\ngoing in that direction,but it's something people\ntalk about it a lot.GARY GENSLER: Right.So there is an ebb and\nflow of regulation,and we'll chat in\na couple minutes.Regulation in finance has been\naround for thousands of years.I mean, literally,\nback when the Hammurabicode was being written, there\nwere regulated interest rates.We went through a\nlong period in Europe", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "where actually it was illegal\nto charge an interest rate,for hundreds of years\nin different societies.So there is an ebb and flow.Now it's much more\ncomplicated today.In a sense.And Isabel was just\nmentioning that Dodd-Frank,passed in the US, was\na post crisis reform.That would be a time, a\nperiod you would think, well,maybe the public, through\nits legislative body,will lean into doing\nmore regulation.And then as you move away\nfrom a crisis moment,you see some easing up.And there is always sort of an\noscillation over the decades.Why don't we take one more?STUDENT: So I think one of\nthe other interesting thingsthat the article brought up\nwas the case of Citigroup,which basically highlights\nthe tradeoff perfectly.So on the positive\nside, if you lookat Citigroup, what\nit's trying to dois it's trying to provide\nuniversal services.So it's a one stop shop for\nall your financial services.Whereas [INAUDIBLE]\nargued that oneof the things that\nshould have been donepost crisis was to break it up.Because the problem with having\nthe universal one-stop shopis that, if it fails, then\nit's an obligation on the fedactually prevent it.GARY GENSLER: So [INAUDIBLE]\nraising somethingabout Citigroup or\nCiticorp that became,in a sense, a one\nstop shop, a shoppingcenter of financial\nproducts, so maybe itshould've been broken up.But who wants to tell\nme what Sheila Bair, whowas the head of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation,said?Because in that interview with\nSheila, she talked about Citi.Alpha?STUDENT: She said\nshe almost, I guess,regrets not letting\nthem restructureand letting them fail,\nbecause it createdthis sort of a moral\nprotection that peoplethought that [INAUDIBLE] large\n[INAUDIBLE] shouldn't survive.GARY GENSLER: Kelly, were you\ngoing to add something to that?STUDENT: Yeah, I was.I thought her interview was--", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "it's kind of hard to weed\nout what she's really saying,because it's toned with\nlittle strings of bias.Obviously, one, because she's\nbeen through that crisisand pretty much brokered\nthat deal, and twobecause she throws in\npolitical maneuvers.So it's hard to\ntell what she thinksis necessarily best for the\nhealth of the financial system.Like she says, bank profits\nare good, dividends are robust.They've got big tax\ncuts, they should bebuilding their capital bunkers.So--GARY GENSLER: Right.But you mean it's hard\nto tell where Sheilais on Citicorp, for instance?STUDENT: Well, and\nalso the state of,like, how a lot of what she says\nis the banks too big to fail.GARY GENSLER: So Sheila\nBair, who was to her coreas a Kansas Republican,\nwho worked for Senator BobDole, who was then, when\nshe worked for him, majorityleader in the US Senate\non the Republican side,is kind of a bit of\na prairie populist,if those terms mean\nsomething to the class.And she got into the\nrole of running the FDICand saw early--frankly a little\nearlier than most--that there was a\nproblem going onin mortgage financing and credit\nlending and the ease of creditin the US.When the crisis\nreally hit hard, shewas part ultimately of the team.Not the head,\nusually the Chairmanof the Federal Reserve, and\nthe Secretary of the Treasury.Or in any country, it's\nusually the finance ministerand the head of the\ncentral bank whois somewhere in a war\nroom sort of setting,literally, in crisis and rolling\nconference calls

don't think has\ndone any primary issuancein well over a decade, maybe a\ncouple of decades in the equitymarkets.But certainly the secondary\nmarket for Apple stockis quite robust.Whereas there's some\nthings that it's onlyabout the primary market.Alone, syndication is\nreally a primary market,and there's not a lot of\ntrading of secondary loans.So it's not all in one place.And again, when

there is no\nuse for blockchain technologyabsent ledgers, but\nI'm hard pressedto think of a really good\nuse case within finance,at least, unless you have\nsome ledger, some recordationof things of value.If you're keeping a\nrecord of things of value,then the immutable\nnature of blockchainbecomes more relevant.If it's not things\nof value, I'm justsaying I'm a little bit\nharder pressed to say,well, you need the complexity\nof this database structure.You could use other database\nstructures to keep it,even though Stuart Haber has\nthat wonderful blockchainthat's published in The New\nYork Times for notaries.So ledgers are records\nof economic activityand financial relationships.They are embedded in\nevery part of finance.Insurance companies\nhave ledgers,investment banks have ledgers,\ncentral banks have ledgers.They are embedded in every\npart and they have been aroundfor thousands of\nyears, and they'reright at the center\nof blockchainbecause the UTXO set in\nBitcoin is a form of a ledger.And there's an account\nbased ledger in Etherium.What is a payment and\nsettlement system?Anybody want to give it a shot?Alpha I'm going to\nmove money to you.A payment system is

around.But poor risk management\ncan be just not evenbeing aware that\nthe risk is there.I think that's what\nyour question was like.Was there just an unawareness\nthat there were such bad thingsgoing on in the street?Or was it-- well,\nwe're aware of itbut we're willing\nto take that risk?I think it was a bit of both.I think that the major\ninvestment banks--the Lehman Brothers\nand some of the others,they were underwriting a lot\nof the subprime mortgages--were aware that there\nwere no doc loans.No document loans.It was called no doc loans.That the down payments\nwere shrinking.Because that was susceptible\nto math, that you could seethere was lower and\nlower down payments.But I don't think that\nthey knew everythingthat was going on the street,\nthe really bad action.I testified in the US Congress\nin the spring of 2000,as the Secretary,\nUndersecretary, about predatorylending.It wasn't that I was prescient.I was asked to testify.And we did a big study between\nthe Department of Housingand the Department of Treasury.And we went out.We had public hearings\nin a bunch of cities,and we wrote a report\nand made recommendations.And Ned Gramlich over\nat the Federal Reservewas

left, and that was that.You know?Al Gore is running to\nsucceed Bill Clinton.The administration couldn't\nhave gotten a law changed,even if we tried at that time.But nonetheless, that's-- so\nI think sometimes it's a bitof both, from\npersonal experience.But back to the crisis.So I think that weak\nunderwriting and predatorylending mixed in to have\na subprime mortgage crisisand then a big housing bubble.But also beyond that--beyond that, easy credit.Easy credit partly because\ninterest rates were so low.We came out of the\nlate part, the 1990s.We went from an asset\nbubble in the stock market,the internet bubble\nburst, and we kind ofmoved that bubble valuation\ninto the housing market.The Federal Reserve\nlowered interest rates,kept interest rates low for a\nvery long time to kind of keepthe economy going.And we even see now President\nTrump and Fed chair Powella little bit at odds about\nwhere should interest rates go.And the Federal Reserve\nis moving interest ratesup in the

countries,\nit's a tug of warand we're seeing that\nplay out a little now.So we have easy credit\nfor a long time,partly supplied by\nforeign governments.Even China, in a sense.I mean, people were willing\nto buy the US paper.But also financial derivatives.Credit default swaps in\nparticular led to a lotmore leverage and also\nthe interconnectedness.The derivatives tied\neverybody together a lot more.Part of the leverage\nwas also accepting modelbased capital rules at banks.The other thing\nis I think we hada lot of poor risk management,\nback to Kyle's point.So poor risk management\nincentive structures.The basic incentive structure\nat banks have a lot of bonuses.And some of you worked at banks.But on some level, it's sort\nof heads I win, tails you lose.I mean, if you put a big\nposition on and it pays off,and you're a trader, and\nyou're managing the mortgagedesk at Lehman and it pays off,\nyou say, all right, where'smy $5 or $10 million bonus?I'm saying if you're\nrunning the department.I mean, hopefully some\nof you will do that.But if you're on the other\nside, and the firm fails,they don't say, please give me\nback that $5 or $10 million.So there's asymmetric\nincentive structures.And those have been written\nabout widely, academically.I mean, we do have a lot\nof asymmetric incentivestructures in banking.Brotish?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]GARY GENSLER: So Brotish asked,\nwhat about the rating agencies?So I was absolutely\nsay, their incentivestructures-- within those\ntwo words, a lot's packed.Thank you.Rating agencies got paid\nfor issuing

[INAUDIBLE]GARY GENSLER: So where did--where did-- but\nthe timber was dry.It was like the fire\nwas going to go,but the system could maybe\nwithstand one failure, NorthernRock or Bear Stearns.But by the summer of '08, in\nthis country when the largefinancial mortgage companies,\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac,had to go into receivership\naround Labor Day of 2008,it was teetering.And then, of

ago.Yes, in a number of ways.But as Sheila Bair's\nwriting said, in other ways,it's not all that different.So I think that we have high\nvaluations in the stock market.But it's not a\nlevered asset class.So real estate bubbles\nusually are very--higher probability that\na real estate bubblewill lead to\ncalamitous outcomes,because there's a lot of\nborrowing against the assetbubble.So when we had no\naid, and you had--in Iceland, when\nthe banks failed.In many countries, when\nyou see huge failures,it's when you have a real estate\nbubble with a lot of borrowingsagainst it.When the

while.Debt bubbles.A debt [INAUDIBLE]\nbubble is much harder.So back to today, I think\nwe have a bit of a bubble.We've had low interest\nrates for a long time.We've had pretty\ngood economic

results of the\nreforms in Europe and the US,there's a lot more\ncapital in the system,meaning less leverage.But on the other hand,\nthe banking sectoris a bit more concentrated.And concentration leads\nto additional risk.The other thing,\nand this is maybemy feeling is, as we're not\nsharing the economic well-beingbroadly in the economy,\nthat middle incomeAmerica, middle income\nof Europe in particularis not sharing as much, I think\nthat hurts us in two ways.One is, if we have the\ndownturn, there's not as much--all economies these days\nare led by consumption.There's not as much

frauds.But there are wide acceptance.And there's 7.5%\nof the US economy,and similar numbers-- probably\n5% to 7% of most economiesare in finance.By the way, because the capital\nmarkets and the equity marketsare about 500% of the economy--\nit's about $100 trillion whenyou add up all\nthose other slides--finance earns 7.5%.So that's about 1.5% vig.That's an old term\nfrom a gambling
