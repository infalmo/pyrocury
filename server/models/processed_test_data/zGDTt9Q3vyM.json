treasurer of\nthe Maryland Democratic Party.Which, if you\nanybody ever asks youto be the treasurer of\na state party, come.I can give you some\nadvice about whatthat's all about\nwhen your home statesenator asks you to do it.So I had to quiet down the\nannual Jefferson Jackson Daydinners.I'd organize these big dinners,\nand there's 400, 500, 600people at these dinners.I couldn't do it.I couldn't get their attention.And Congressman Elijah\nCummings comes up,and he just leans into the mic.Shh.And it quieted the\nwhole place down.I said, Congressman,\nwhat is this?Is this something you've\nlearned in politics,something you learned from\nyour minister, your priest?He said, it works every\ntime, works every time.So Elijah Cummings gave\nme that little duty.Blockchain and\nmoney, we're here.I know it's a little\nbit like eating broccolithese last couple of\nclasses, because we wentthrough cryptography, and\nthen we moved a little bitinto consensus protocols.And today, we're

chunks of data,but there's also a chain\nof individual transactions.Shimon, is that a hand raised\nor just scratching your head?AUDIENCE: I'll be more careful.GARY GENSLER: No,\nthat's all right.Shimon is a faculty member\nof the Finance departmenthere at Sloan.And some of you might take his\nFinance 1 course, I assume.Somebody in here is, probably.So the input is\njust really the

Right,\nso the generationof a freshly minted bitcoin--\nnot the way that Patrick Murckgot it when he's selling\nhis services for the law,but how a miner gets it,\nthey get their transactions.Remember initially, 50 coins\nwas what happened initially backin 2009.Now it's 12 and 1/2 coins.And in a short couple--maybe it's about\n18 or 20 months,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "it goes to 6

and 1/2 coins being issued.And then the output--so a transaction format\nis pretty straightforward,in a sense.The input is a previous output\nand a digital signature,and then, to whom do\nyou want to send it.And it's sent to\nBitcoin addresses.That's why we spent\njust a moment--we just glossed over what\na Bitcoin address is.It's sort of a translation\nto a public key,but it's not identical\nto a public key.And of course, you need value.Value measured in\nbitcoins or satoshis,or if we're on the\nEthereum network,it would be an ether and\ngas, et cetera, et cetera.On 1,600 different\nplatforms, it couldbe a different native currency.Lock time, I don't\nthink lock timewas in any of the readings.But anybody want to tell\nme what a lock time is?It's relevant to some of\nhow the technology goes.Anybody want to take a guess?Where's Alin?Not Alin the PhD, but Alin\nfrom the digital currencyinitiative.No?You're hiding.You don't want to say\nwhat a lock time is?AUDIENCE: I thought it's some\nsort of protection mechanismfor, I guess, double spending.GARY GENSLER: It is a protection\nmechanism, but not so muchabout double spending.Tom, did I see your hand up?AUDIENCE: This is a guess.Is it when the\ntransaction is hashed?GARY GENSLER: It's when.It's about time.It's when the\ntransaction can happen.So right now, it's\n2:45 on September 20.If you put a lock time\nin at 2:50 or 2:55,it couldn't happen until 2:55.So you can actually\nconditional the transaction.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "That's all lock time is.But you can say, it\ncan't happen until.You could

in Bitcoinis, is that it will not\nvalidate a transaction early.And if you put October 6\non a handwritten check,the bank might still take\nit, even though they probablyshouldn't.So it is like the\ndate on a check,except it's verified and\nvalidated and so forth.I'm going to take\nEmily and then Shimon.AUDIENCE: So if you were to set\nthe lock time in the future,could that mess up the\nblocks in the chain?What is kind of the\nright chain of eventsthat you're recognizing\nif you're choosing to seta lock time in the future?I guess the broader question\nwould be, why would youset a lock time in the future?GARY GENSLER: Shimon,\nwere you answering that?AUDIENCE: No, no, no.I want to ask you, in the\n[INAUDIBLE] question section,is what purpose does\nit serve, right?AUDIENCE: It's not a really\nTuring complete language,so you're not really trying\nto create conditions here.But this is sort of a condition.GARY GENSLER: So\nit's a condition.Because at any\npoint in time, youmight want a\ncondition of payment.You might want a condition\nof payment on time.And we're, in a\nfew slides, goingto talk about the scripting\nlanguage, the computerlanguage that allows\ntransactions to happen.Shimon said, was\nnot Turing complete.From the readings,\nanybody want to tell uswhat Turing complete is in\ncomputer science language?No?Anybody know who Turing

computer scientists.Turing complete allows\nyou to do loops insideof computer programs.And the script language does\nnot allow that to happen.Every function needs to\nsort of have some language.I know Alin looking at\nme to see I don't dive.But to answer Emily's\nquestion, it's just,there's so many different ways\nto condition a transaction.And Satoshi Nakamoto\nthought, well,let's put it in here, right\nin the transaction format,that you can condition on time.And then two parties\ncould do that.To your question about\nwhether it could inadvertentlylead to double spending,\nit's a very good question.Can I hold it until we just\ndo validation for a second?So this is a unique\nidentifier for the input.But it's really uniquely\nidentifying from a past output.What's the block number?Is it from the 250,000th\nblock or the 300,000th block?So it takes\nliterally a block ID.And then within that block,\nwhich one of its 1,500transactions might it be?So you can find any transaction\non an entire blockchainby knowing the block, and\nthen within the block, whichtransaction.It's just a data mechanism\non how to store data.And through this\nmechanism, there'sa chain of transactions,

a\nquestion whether anybodywould give value.And until about 18\nmonths later, whenthose two pizzas went for\n10,000 bitcoin, what was it?Or until somebody started\nthe first exchange,a crypto

using Amanda's\nname and James' name.I'm using your Bitcoin address--Amanda's Bitcoin address,\nand James' Bitcoin address.So rather than\nbeing account-based,like if you have an account at\nBank of America, and you say,I want to send $10,\nI just check to makesure I have more than $10.In Bitcoin, I actually have\nto fine individual transactionoutputs that add up\nto-- in this case,I want to send

back to me.But I've decided to\nincentivize miners and leavea little extra, 0.1 bitcoin,\nwhich would be a lot of fee,actually.That would be about,\nwhat, $640 or so?I probably wouldn't do that.I

transaction is validated,\none of the validation methodsis to make sure that the lock\ntime has actually happened,that you've passed\nthe lock time.Another validation point is\nthat inputs are greater thanor equal to outputs.If outputs are\ngreater than inputs,the transaction will\nnot be validated.The digital signatures\nhave to be validated,going just back to\nthe prior slide.That digital

about markets.AUDIENCE: I would say\nthat the person thatis sending the transaction\nhas the abilityto choose how much it will\npay for that transaction.And in the bank, it's\nregulated, and you pay.Maybe that's one\nof the differences.GARY GENSLER: All\nright, so one differenceis that the bank is setting,\ngenerally, a fixed feeschedule, and this is\na decentralized marketmechanism for setting fees.Sean.AUDIENCE: The fee for\nintermediaries a lot highercompared to Bitcoin,\nthe transaction fees.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "GARY GENSLER: So\nSean's second pointis that,

it'snot different from a\ncentralized intermediary.It's just, the\nfunctions are the same.The amounts, maybe\nthe amount that I pay,the amount of the\nfees are different,but the concepts are the same.GARY GENSLER: All right, so\nAlin is basically saying,well, maybe it's\nnot so different.I mean, though it might be\nfloating rather than fixed,it might be currently\nlower rather than higher,but you're saying,\nfundamentally, it'sabout the same.One minute, Shimon,\nlet me just--because you're faculty.You're going to actually\ntell us the answer.AUDIENCE: Question--\nis this mandatory?GARY GENSLER: Very good\nquestion-- it's not mandatory.AUDIENCE: So that could create\na big misalignment of interest.GARY GENSLER: So\nit's not mandatory.Fees are market-based.And at times, like\nlast December,they were really high.And now they're\nquite low, partlybecause the Bitcoin network is\nnot humming at full capacity.It can readily fit 1,000 to\n2,000 transactions a block.And it's not like\nthere's a jammingto get 10,000 and 20,000\ntransactions into a block,as there was last December.I'm sorry, Shimon.AUDIENCE: I think\nit's very different,in the sense that\nyou're basicallyinflating the fee in most\n[INAUDIBLE] inflation.So even if when\nyou don't transact,you're paying implicitly for\nother people's transactions,and that's going to\nchange over time.So that's actually kind\nof a clever mechanismof how, structurally,\nthese are goingto shift over time\nin the network,as it hopefully matures.GARY GENSLER: Why don't\nwe take one more here--", "start": 1200.0,

the\nsame network, I would say,rather than just going\nto another destination.GARY GENSLER: I hear you.But it might actually leave\nthe network to lawyers,like Patrick.Or it might leave the network\nif you use it at Starbucks,if Starbucks would accept it.So I'm challenging\nyour thought, but youcan challenge mine back.Why don't we close out with\nEric, and then just move on.AUDIENCE: The difference\nmight be in the perspective.From the person that's\noriginated a transaction,it's basically the same thing.But if you think\nabout it as a system,there's no single entity\ngathering all the moneyfrom transactions.You have a network, a\n[INAUDIBLE] network,of [INAUDIBLE] that\nare getting that.And besides, once we get\nout past the 21 millionbitcoin generation cap,\nthen all the systemsmust be using\n[INAUDIBLE] in some way.And transaction fees\nwould be [INAUDIBLE]..GARY GENSLER: So Eric raises\ntwo points that I'll--there are other points, but\ntwo that I want to repeat.One is, this is more\ndecentralized possibly todaythan the current commercial\nbanking system, for instance,for transaction processing,\nor the transaction processingthat Visa and First\nData do, which

though.Have you lost them\nin the meantime?They might be worth something.But in the meantime, have\nyou lost the private keyto those little satoshis?I put on here three\nmoments of timejust to give you the\nsense of the actual numberof transactions\nthat have happened.There's been 342 million\ntransactions on the Bitcoinnetwork to date, or\nas of a day or two agowhen I put the slides together.So of the 340\nmillion transactions,only about 54 million\nare still outstanding.The other 290 million have\nbeen spent, if you wish.", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Yes.AUDIENCE: So then where are\nthese outstanding transactionsstored?Are they still being included\nin the blocks themselves,where you add them\nto the [INAUDIBLE]??GARY GENSLER: Which outstanding\ntransactions, the 54 millionthat are still available?The 54 million all reside in\na database within the Bitcoinsoftware called the unspent\ntransaction output, UTXO.And UTXO-- these aren't\nletters I'm making up--that's a database, 54\nmillion transactions.Separately, they are actually\nin the blockchain itself.So all 340 million transactions\nthat have ever happenedare in the blockchain.But to make it easier for\nthe software, the 54 millionthat have never been spent\nreside in a software.Does that answer the question?Work with me.AUDIENCE: So it's a\ndistributed databaseamongst all the different nodes.GARY GENSLER: Correct.All 10,000 of the nodes\ncan have the full UTXO set.Some wallet providers\nhave the full UTXO set,but they don't have to.Somewhat lightweight nodes\nusually don't, but can.But a lightweight\nnode would neverwant to have all 340 million\nand the full blockchain.So in essence, they're\nin multiple places,because they're in the full\nblockchain, 10,000 nodes.And they're also in the UTXO,\nnot only on the 10,000 nodes,but occasionally elsewhere.Alin.AUDIENCE: So I heard you say\nthe word spent transaction,which is a bit misleading.Because a transaction can\nbe spent and not spent.", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.454}, {"text": "Because, for example, you\nwould have two outputs.One output is spent by\na future transaction,and the other\noutput is not spent.So it's a bit misleading\nto say spent transaction,because that only happens when\nthe transaction has only oneoutput and that output is spent.GARY GENSLER: Well,\nI'm using it lightly.I'm saying that, of the 340\nmillion transactions thathave happened, 290--AUDIENCE: Have an\noutput that is spent,or what are you saying exactly?Because transactions\nhave multiple outputs.They might have n, and\nmaybe k of them are spent.So the other\noutputs are unspent.GARY GENSLER: I'm saying\nthere's 340 million--if I did my data search\ncorrectly-- and I'm fallible,so I might not have.But if I did my data\nsource correctly,there was 340 million\nprevious outputs.290 million of them are gone.AUDIENCE: OK, so then you\nshould say transaction outputs,because those are different\nthan transactions.GARY GENSLER: Yes.Except for it was\neasier to put TXS.But yes, Alin's clarification\nis, I believe, accurate.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\nso people can understandthat there is a difference\nbetween a transactionand a transaction output.GARY GENSLER: In essence,\nwhat Alin's saying is,there's currently 54\nmillion transaction outputsin the UTXO, which\nalso says outputs.There had been, in the past,\nanother 290 million outputsthat have already been spent.Are we together?So there's a scripting language.There's a little bit\nof computer code.I said there was no prerequisite\nto take any computerscience before you were here.And my own computer\nprogramming is so old,because when I was programming,\nit was in Fortran and APL.And you can look that up.It's kind

going to\nget the count right,but there's several hundred,\nbut not several thousand,little operations\nand codes that youcan use in the Bitcoin script.It's not Turing\ncomplete, which meansyou can't do a lot of the\nthings that you can do in allthe rest of computer science.But it's more secure.In essence, it has\nfewer attack vectors.It's harder to bring\ndown a little bit.It's a programming\ncode, as I said.For those interested,\nit's called stack-based,where you sort of move the\ncode over one at a timeas it's being performed.And it gives some flexibility.And back to Emily's question\nabout why there was lock time,or Shimon's, scripting code\nallows for some conditionality,that it appears that\nNakamoto was tryingto give some\nability to conditiona transaction on events, but\nnot so much conditionality, somuch flexibility, that he\nneeded a Turing complete.So he kind of, I'm going to\nsay, chose a midway place.I believe, you could\nhave created Bitcoinand say there was no\nscripting language.It was just going to be a\nstraight instruction, movingthis input to another output.Created a little bit of\ncomputer code, but not a lot.That's what I think of the\neconomics and the marketplacefor this.And next Tuesday when we\ntalk about smart contracts--and I promise you,\nthere's a reasonfor the craziness of\nmy talking about Turingcomplete and scripting

need\nto know anythingmore about computer\nscience than you want,unless you go with Tom\ndown that rabbit holeand spend more time reading.So there's four different types\nof, I call them script types.They're not actual script\nwords, but you will readabout these from time to time.And I just wanted\nto cover these four.The UTXO, remember, is about\n54 million transactions.And there's been a\nnice academic paperthat I didn't assign that\nwas written earlier this yearthat investigated\nthe whole 54 million,all of the unspent transactions.And this is how it broke down.81% are transactions

compression,\nthe commitment of a Bitcoinaddress.We're now up to 18%.This didn't exist three\nand four years ago, really.But 18% go to a\nconditional script.It's a hash of a\nconditional script.So somebody saying, Emily,\nit's not even about time.It's like, you can\nonly get it whenall these other instructions\nthat are in the scriptinglanguage happen.And I'm going to hide the\nconditions in a

layer 2.We're going to be talking about\nlayer 2 later in the semester,where there's a whole way to put\ntechnology on top of Bitcoin.And it's because the\nscripting language is therethat you can do that.Any questions on script?I know I'm trying to cover\na big, weighty topic in 120seconds or less.No?So just back to the whole--this is just a review.What have we've talked about?There's that little\ngraphic again.It's just a bunch of blocks.That's what a blockchain is.Though today, we realize\nthat underneath the blocks,we have another chain.I often think of two chains--the chains of blocks.In Bitcoin, there's about\na half a million blocks.But underneath that, there's\nall the transactions thatare, in fact, chained, as well.54 million of those outputs\nhave not yet been spentand 290 million outputs\nhave been spent.But underneath about a\nhalf a million blocks,there's been 340 million\noutputs, so to speak.It creates a database.Bitcoin is a\ntransaction database.Next Tuesday, we'll talk about\nan account-based databasein Ethereum.But it could be a ledger\nwhich is transactions", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "or a ledger which is balances.Satoshi Nakamoto

Satoshi Nakamoto is,we won't know the answer.OfCourse, hash functions\nwe talked about,and digital signatures,\nand a consensus protocol.So I like to think of\nit in three buckets,whether it's for a\ndinner party conversationor digging into three lectures.It's the cryptography itself.We did that last Thursday.And if you have to\nremember anything,it's only two\ncryptographic primitives--hash

onething when you said, it's just.Because they actually use\nhash functions in the middleof the proof of work.Because the hash\npointer points--block 3 points to block\n2 and there's hashing.They use the hash function to\ncompress a bunch of data, whatI call the Merkle\nTree, but it's taking1,500 or 2,000 transactions\nand squeezing it into one hash.So they're hashing all\nof these things up.It

it\nchanges in real time.And it's just, you put any\ntext in, you put a password in,and it turns it into\na blockchain address.And that's all a hash is.It translates text into a hash.GARY GENSLER: Or

a\nparental unit, if you wish.It's all of us out\nthere on the playgroundfiguring it out\ntogether somehow.AUDIENCE: Sorry, I\nhave a quesiton here.For the proof of\nwork, my questionis, for example,

you is, yes.And that is one of the\ncommercial challengesto blockchain as we\nknow it in Bitcoin.There are certain approaches\nto that, layering in technologyon top of, they call it\nlayer 2 or lightning network.We're not going to dive\ninto lightning network.But everybody should hold\nonto Anton's question.It's the right question,\nthat if all of youbring your critical reasoning\nto this

you're transacting with,\nyou can accept the transactionwith 0 confirmations.As long as it gets\ninto the mem pooland has a reasonable\nfee attached to it,then it will eventually\nget included on a block,and that's probably good\nenough for most people.GARY GENSLER: So what\nHugo is saying is,another approach is to\ntake counterparty risk,that Anton's--back to Anton's\nquestion-- does itmean you have to\nwait 10 minutes?The actual technical\nanswer to thatis, no, you don't have to wait\n10 minutes, unless you wantfinal settlement,\nif you want finalitywith no counterparty\nrisk, no commercial risk.Hugo is saying, well,\nif I'm willing to takesome economic or commercial\ncounterparty risk, which is,", "start": 3120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "in finance, you take\nit all the time,then maybe

First Data.I don't mean to say that\nit might not be alsofrom Visa and the banks.But I'll just say\nthe payment systemhas some counterparty risk.Because final settlement\nin our paymentsystem doesn't happen\nwithin seconds.So the actual answer--\nthank you, Hugo.Clean me up again.You should do this all the time.Everybody should clean me up.It's that final\nsettlement can happen.And so you have to\nfind other solutions,whether it's some\ncommercial arrangementwith counterparty risk or\nother technical commercialarrangements.Shimon?AUDIENCE: Well, I'll\nmake a counterargument,which is that, 10 minutes is\nnot final settlement, right?Because it could be forking.So it's basically\nthe probabilityof the finality\ngoes up with time,which is associated with how\nmany blocks are attached to[INAUDIBLE].GARY GENSLER: So Shimon's point\nis that, even in 10 minutes,your probability of\nfinality is not complete.Because the block\nmight not be the blockthat's included in\nthe longest

know about mining,what do I need to know\nabout transaction,is it one and the same?I apologize.They overlap, but\nthey're not the same.So think of a Venn diagram.But it's a very good question.The

there's a time lock on\nit, is there a condition?Might there even be this\nlittle bit of scripting codethat puts other\nconditions, like therehas to be multiple signatures?Has it been double spent?It

add--the proof of work that\nSatoshi did on the consensusto [INAUDIBLE] it's also novel.GARY GENSLER: Yeah.But novel, though,\ndidn't Adam Backalready do some\nof it in hashcash.So its application was novel.I come out where I think\nthe genius is bringing itall together, and using\nAdam Back's proof of workin a way that really\naddressed double spend.Adam Back was not dealing\nwith a double spend issue.He had different challenges.It was about email spam.Frankly, it didn't\neven work with email.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] we\nweren't counting [INAUDIBLE]work as a completely\nnovel thing,his article discussed how\nit was already published.So I guess it's the application.GARY GENSLER: It's the\napplication specificallyto the double spend.Now, Patrick Murck,\nwould you answer it then?This is somebody who ran\nthe Bitcoin Foundation,but he's a lawyer, you know?PATRICK MURCK: I think\nthat's absolutely right.So usually-- and I think they\naddress it in that particularpaper--when somebody

10,000 nodes\nand this many light nodesand the miners and the\nmining pool operators.And they all have their\nseparate economics.And so if anybody wants to\ncome and get office hours,talk about those economics,\nplease come on in.If there's nothing you\nremember from the reading,I've now read this\npaper probably six timesto kind of slowly get\nit through my head.But every time I\nread the Clark paper,I go, wow, that really helps me.Because it's not like\nSatoshi Nakamoto just flippedhis fingers and there it--it was on the backs of\na lot of cryptography,a lot of technology earlier.But this is the\nchart I turn back to,and it's sometimes helps me.Ah, there's time-stamping,\nthere's digital cache,there's proof of work,\nand how these things.Maybe 10 years from\nnow, they'll look backand Nakamoto's stuff\nwill just be built upon.That's the central question.That's what some\nof our colleaguesare doing over at the\nDigital Currency Initiativeor over at the\nComputer Sciences Lab.They're saying, can\nthey build upon thisand take it to another level?Right now-- and you'll see\nthroughout the semester--there's not a lot of\nfull scale applicationsof this technology.But it might just be

compressed?GARY GENSLER: Very good\nquestion-- my summary of it--though others' probably\nwould be more expert.My summary is, you get a choice.You could do either.So let's take it in blockchain\nrather than in the cloud.You can choose to save in\na blockchain just hashes,and have the full\npicture somewhere else.Let's say you were going\nto do a whole database of--AUDIENCE: A library.GARY GENSLER: Of what?AUDIENCE: I'd say\nlike a library.GARY GENSLER: A library--and so there's 100,000\nbooks in the library.You could hash\nall 100,000 books,and then store the hashes in\nthe blockchain and not the booksthemselves.And that would form a\nblockchain of the commitmentsto those books.Or you could actually, I\nguess, put the books themselvesinto the blockchain.Now, I saw some shaking\nheads in the middle.Alin from the Digital\nCurrency Initiative.AUDIENCE: The way I understand\nthis is, the answer is no.You can store the hash.That doesn't replace the data.The storing of the hash\nallows you to provethat you have the data.But the fact that\nyou store the hashdoesn't mean that\nyou store the data.GARY GENSLER: But Alin,\nthere's a two-part question.You
