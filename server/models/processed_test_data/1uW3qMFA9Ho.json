[{"text": "Welcome to the first lecture\nof this class.You may be used to having a\nfirst lecture devoted togeneral comments and motivating\nexamples.This one will be different.We will dive into the heart\nof the subject right away.In fact, today we will\naccomplish a lot.By the end of this lecture, you\nwill know about all of theelements of a probabilistic\nmodel.A probabilistic model is a\nquantitative description of asituation, a phenomenon,\nor an experimentwhose outcome is uncertain.Putting together such a model\ninvolves two key steps.First, we need to describe the\npossible outcomes of theexperiment.This is done by specifying\na so-called sample space.And then, we specify a\nprobability law, which assignsprobabilities to outcomes or\nto collections of outcomes.The probability law tells us,\nfor example, whether oneoutcome is much more likely\nthan some other outcome.Probabilities have to satisfy\ncertain basic properties inorder to be meaningful.These are the axioms of\nprobability theory.For example probabilities\ncannot be negative.Interestingly, there will be\nvery few axioms, but they arepowerful, and we will see\nthat they have lots ofconsequences.We will see that they imply\nmany other properties thatwere not part of the axioms.We will then go through a couple\nof very simple examplesinvolving models with\neither discreteor continuous outcomes.As you will be seeing many times\nin this class, discretemodels are conceptually\nmuch easier.Continuous models involve some\nmore sophisticated concepts,and we will point out some of\nthe subtle issues that arise.And finally, we will talk a\nlittle bit about the bigpicture, about the role of\nprobability theory, and itsrelation with the real world.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.454}]
