will be the beginningof what you could say is the\nbeginning of linear algebra,the beginning of real linear\nalgebra which is seeinga bigger picture with vector\nspaces -- not just vectors,but spaces of vectors and\nsub-spaces of those spaces.So we're a little ahead\nof the syllabus, whichis good, because we're\ncoming to the placewhere, there's a lot todo.Okay.So, to begin with permutations.Can I just --so these permutations, those\nare matrices P and they executerow exchanges.And we may need them.We may have a\nperfectly good matrix,a perfect matrix A that's\ninvertible that we can solve

to allow --to complete the --the theory, the possibility\nthat I take my matrix A,I start elimination, I find\nout that I need row exchangesand I do it and\ncontinue and I finish.Okay.Then all I want

this Uwe know, with zeroes down here.That's only possible.That description of\nelimination assumesthat we don't have a P, that we\ndon't have any row exchanges.And now I just want\nto say, okay, howdo I account for row exchanges?Because that doesn't.The P in this factorization\nis the identity matrix.The rows were in a good\norder, we left them there.Maybe I'll just add a\nlittle moment of reality,too, about how Matlab\nactually does elimination.Matlab not only checks whether\nthat pivot is not zero,as every human would do.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.113}, {"text": "It checks for is

exchanges do,but we won't do them\nunless we have to.But we may have to.And then, the result is --it's hiding here.It's the main fact.This is the description of\nelimination with row exchanges.So A equal L U\nbecomes P A equal L U.So this P is the matrix\nthat does the row exchanges,and actually it does them --it gets the rows\ninto the right order,into the good order\nwhere pivots will not --where zeroes won't appear\nin the pivot position,where L and U will come\nout right as up here.So, that's the point.Actually, I don't want\nto labor that point,that a permutation matrix --and you

the general case.This is -- any\ninvertible A we get this.For almost every one,\nwe don't need a P.But there's that handful\nthat do need row exchanges,and if we do need\nthem, there they are.Okay, finally, just to\nremember what P was.So permutations, P is\nthe identity matrixwith reordered rows.I include in reordering the\npossibility that you justleave them the same.So the identity\nmatrix is -- okay.That's, like, your basic\npermutation matrix --your do-nothing permutation\nmatrix is the identity.And then there are the ones\nthat exchange two rows and thenthe ones that exchange three\nrows and then then ones thatexchange four --well, it gets a little --it gets more interesting\nalgebraicallyif you've got four rows,\nyou might exchange themall in one big cycle.One to two, two

be highly\ninterested in matricesthat have nice properties.And one property that -- maybe\nI could rewrite that as Ptranspose P is the identity.That tells me in\nother words that thisis the inverse of that.Okay.We'll be interested in\nmatrices that have P transposeP equal the identity.There are more of them\nthan just permutations,but my point right now is that\npermutations are like a littlegroup

a matrixon the board here, have I?So I'd better do it.So suppose I take a matrix\nlike (1 2 4; 3 3 1).It's a rectangular\nmatrix, three by two.And I want to transpose it.So what's --I'll use a T,

columns,two by three.So it's short and wider.And, of course, that row --\nthat column becomes a row --that column becomes\nthe other row.And at the same time,\nthat row became a column.This row became a column.Oh, what's the general\nformula for the transpose?So the transpose --you see it in numbers.What I'm going to write is\nthe same thing in symbols.The numbers are the\nclearest, of course.But

column number\nbecomes the row number.No problem.Okay.Now, a special --the best matrices, we could say.In a lot of applications,\nsymmetric matrices show up.So can I just call attention\nto symmetric matrices?What does that mean?What does that word\nsymmetric mean?It means that this transposing\ndoesn't change the matrix.A transpose equals A.And an example.So, let's take a matrix\nthat's

to do itin R^10, and we may take a\ncombination of five vectorsin R^10, and what will we have?God knows.It's some subspace.We'll have five vectors.They'll all have ten components.We take their combinations.We don't have R^5 , because our\nvectors have ten components.And we possibly have, like,\nsome five dimensional flat thing", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "going through the\norigin for sure.Well, of course, if those five\nvectors were all on the line,then we would only\nget that line.So, you see, there are, like,\nother possibilities here.It depends what -- it depends\non those five vectors.Just like if our two columns\nhad been on the same line,then the column space would\nhave been only a line.Here it was a plane.Okay.I'm going to stop at that point.That's the central idea of\n-- the great example of howto create a subspace\nfrom a matrix.Take its columns, take\ntheir combinations,all their linear combinations\nand you get the column space.And that's the\ncentral sort of --we're looking at linear\nalgebra at a higher level.When I look at A -- now,\nI want to look at Ax=b.That'll be the first\nthing in the next lecture.How do I understand\nAx=b in this language --in this new language of vector\nspaces and column spaces.And what are other subspaces?So the column space is a big\none, there are others to come.Okay, thanks.",
