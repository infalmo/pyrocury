PROFESSOR: So really, what my main concern has been for quite a few years is to make some theory of what makes people able to solve so many kinds of problems. I guess, if you ran through the spectrum of all the animals, you'd find lots of problems that some animals can solve and people can't, like how many of you could build a beaver dam and/or termite nest. So there are all sorts of things that evolution manages to produce. But maybe the most impressive one is what the human infant can do just by hanging around for 10, or 20, or 30", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " years and watching what other humans can do. So we can solve all sorts of problems, and my quarrel with most of the artificial intelligence community has been that the great success of science in the last 500 years really has been in physics. And it's been rewarded by finding little sets of rules, like Newton's three laws, and Maxwell's four laws, and Einstein's one law or two, that explained a huge range of everyday phenomena. Of course, in the 1920s and '30s, that apple cart got upset. Actually, Einstein himself, who had discovered the first quantum phenomena, namely the quantization of photons, had produced various scientific laboratory observations that were inexplicable in terms of either Maxwell,", "start": 90.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " or Newton, or Einstein's earlier formulations. So my picture of the history is that in the 19th century and a little bit earlier going back to Lock, and Spinoza, and Hume, and a few of those philosophers, even Immanuel Kant, they had some pretty good psychological ideas. And as I mentioned the other day, I suspect that Aristotle was more like a modern cognitive psychologist and had even better ideas. But we've probably lost a lot of them, because there are no tape recorders. Who knows what Aristotle and Plato said that their students didn't write down? Because it sounded silly. The idea that we developed around here, mostly, Seymour Papert, and a lot of students-- Pat Winston was one of the great stars of that period. --was the idea that to get anything like human intellectual abilities, you're going to have to have all sorts of high level representations.", "start": 180.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " So one has to say, the old conditioned reflex of stimulus producing a response isn't good enough. The stimulus has to be represented by some kind of semantic structure somewhere in the brain or mind. So far as I know, it's only in the theories of not even modern artificial intelligence, but the AI of the '60s, and '70s, and '80s, that people thought about what could be the internal representation of the kinds of things that we think about. And even more important, if one of those representations, you see something, or you remember some incident. And your brain represents it in some way. And if that way doesn't work, you take a breath. And you sort of stumble around and find another way to represent it. Maybe when the original event first happened, you represented it in three or four ways. So we're beginning to see-- did anybody hear Ferucci's talk? The Watson guy was up here a couple of days ago. I missed it, but they haven't made a technical publication", "start": 270.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " as far as I know of how this Watson program works. But it sounds like it's something of a interesting society of mind like structure, and it'd be nice if they would-- has anybody read any long paper on it? There have been a lot of press reports. Have you seen anything, Pat? Anyway, they seem to have done some sorts of commonsense reasoning. As I said the other day, I doubt that Watson could understand why you can pull something with a string, but you can't push. Actually, I don't know if any existing program can understand that yet. I saw some amazing demonstrations Monday by Steve Wolfram of his Wolfram Alpha, which doesn't do much common sense reasoning. But what it does do is, if you put in a sentence, it finds five or 10 different representations, anything you can find that's sort of mathematical. So when you ask a question, it gives you 10 answers, and it's much better than previous systems.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " Because it doesn't-- well, Google gives you a quarter million answers. But that's too many. Anyway, I'm just going to talk a little bit more, and everybody should be trying to think of a question that the rest of the class might answer. So there are lots of different kinds of problems that people can solve going back to the first one, like which moving object out there is my mother and which might be a potential threat. So there are a lot of kinds of problems that we solve, and I've never seen any discussion in psychology books of what are the principal activities of common sense thinking. Somehow, they don't have-- or people don't-- before computers, there really wasn't any way to think about high level thinking. Because there weren't any technically usable ways to describe complicated processes. The idea of a conditional expression", "start": 450.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " was barely on the threshold of psychology, so what kinds of problems do we have? And if you take some particular problem, like I find these days, I can't get the top off bottles. So how do I solve that? And there are lots of answers. One is you look for somebody who looks really strong. Or you reach into your pocket, and you probably have one of these and so on. There must be some way to put it on the floor, and step on it, and kick it with the other foot. So there are lots of problems that we're facing every day. And if you look in traditional cognitive psychology-- well, what's the worst theory? The worst and the best theory got popular in the 1980s, and it was called rule based systems. And you just have a big library, which says, if you have a soda bottle and you can't get the cap off, then do this, or that, or the other. So some people decided, well, that's really all you need.", "start": 540.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " Rod Brooks in the 1980s sort of said, we don't need those fancy theories that people, like Minsky, and Papert, and Winston are working on. Why not just say for each situation in the outer world have a rules that says how to deal with that situation? Let's make a hierarchy of them, and he described a system that sort of looked like the priority interrupt system in a computer. And he won all sorts of prizes for this really bad idea that spread around the world, but it solved a lot of problems. There are things about priority interrupt that aren't obvious, like suppose you have-- in the first computers, there was some problem. Because what should you do, if there's several signals coming into the computer, and you want to respond to them? And some of the signals are very fast and very short. Then you might think, well, I should give the highest priority to the signal that's going to be there the shortest time or something like that. The funny part is that when you made such a system, the result was that, if you had a computer that was responding to some signal that's coming in at a--", "start": 630.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " I'm talking about the days when computers were only working at a few kilohertz, few thousand operations a second. God, that's slow, a million times shorter than what you have in your pocket. And if you give priority to the signals that have to be reacted to very fast, then what happens if you type to those computers? It would never see them, because it's always-- I saw this happening once. And finally, somebody realized that you should give the highest priority to the inputs that come in least frequently, because there's always-- otherwise, if there's something coming in very frequently, you'll just always be responding to it. Any of you run into this? It took me a while to figure out why. Anyway, there are lots of kinds of problems. And the other day, I was complaining that we didn't have enough ways to do this. We had hundreds of words for emotions, and here's a couple of dozen. They're in chapter seven and eight actually most of these. So here's a bunch of words for describing ways to think,", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " but they're not very technical. So you can talk about remorse, and sorrow, and blah, blah, blah. Hundreds and hundreds of words for feelings, and it's a lot of effort to find a dozen words for intellectual, for-- what should I call them? --problem solving processes. So it's curious to me that the great field called cognitive psychology has not focused in that direction. Anyway, here's about 20 or 30 of them. And you'll find them scattered through chapters seven and eight. Here's my favorite one, and I don't know of any proper name for it. But if you're trying to solve a problem, and you're stuck, and the example that comes to my mind is, if I'm trying to remember someone's name, I can tell when it's hopeless. And the reason is that for somehow or other, I know that there's a huge tree of choices. That's one way to represent what's going on, and I might know that-- I'm sure that name has a Z in it. So you search around and try everything you can.", "start": 810.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " But of course, it doesn't have a Z, so the way to solve that problem is to give up. And then a couple of minutes later, the name occurs to you. And you have no idea how it happened and so forth. Anyway, the long story is that Papert, and I, and lots of really great students in the '60s and '70s spent a lot of time making little bottles of problem solvers that didn't work. And we discovered that you needed something else, and we had put that in. Other people would come and say, that's hopeless. You're putting in more things than you need. And my conclusion is that, wow, it's the opposite of physics. In physics, you're always trying to find-- what is it called? --Occam's razor. Never have more structure than you need, because what? Well, it'll waste your time, but my feeling was, never", "start": 900.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " have less than you'll need. But you don't know how many you'll need. So what I did, I had four of these, and then I forced myself to put in two more. And people ask, what's the difference between self models and self-conscious processes? And I don't care. Well, what's the difference between self-conscious and reflective? I don't care. And the reason is that, wow, it's nice to have a box that isn't full yet. So if you find something that your previous theory-- going back to Brooks, he was so successful getting simple robots to work that he concluded that the things didn't need any internal representations at all. And for some mysterious reason, the Artificial Intelligence Society gave him their annual big prize for this very wrong idea, and it caused AI research to sort of half collapse in places, like Japan. He said, oh, rule based systems is all we need. Anybody want to defend him? The odd thing is, if you talk to Brooks, he's one of the best philosophers you'll ever meet. And he says, oh yes, of course, that's wrong, but it helps people do research and get things done. And as, I think, I mentioned the other day", "start": 990.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " when the 3 Mile Island thing happened, there was no way to get into the reactor. That was 1980. And 30 years later when the-- how do you pronounce it? --Fukushima accident happened, there was no robot that could go in and open a door. I don't know who to blame for that. Maybe us. But my picture of the history is that the places that did research on robotics, there were quite a few places. And for example, Carnegie Mellon was very impressive in getting the Sony dogs to play soccer, and they're still at it. And I think I mentioned that Sony still has a stock of-- what's it called? AUDIENCE: AIBOs. PROFESSOR: Say it again. AUDIENCE: AIBOs. PROFESSOR: FIBO? AUDIENCE: AIBO, A-I-B-O. PROFESSOR: All right, AIBOs, but the trouble is they're always broken. There was a robot here called Cog that Brooks made,", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " and it sometimes worked. But usually, it wasn't working, so only one student at that time could experiment with the robot. What was that wonderful project of trying to make a walking machine for four years in-- there was a project to make a robot walk. And there was only one of it, so first, only one student at a time can do research on it. And most of the time, something's broken, and you're fixing it. So you end up that you sort of get five or 10 hours a week on your laboratory physical robot. At the same time, Ed Friedkin had a student who tried to make a walking robot, and it was a stick figure on the screen. I forgot the student's name. But anyway, he simulated gravity and a few other things. And in a couple of weeks, he had a pretty good robot that could walk, and go around turns, and bank. And if you simulated an oily floor, it could slip and fall, which we considered the high point of the demo actually. So there we find--", "start": 1170.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " anyway, I've sort of asked you to read my two books for this course. But those are not the only good texts about artificial intelligence. And if you want to dig deeper, it might be a good idea to go to the web and type in Aaron Sloman, S-L-O-M-A-N. And you'll get to his website, which is something like that. And Sloman is a sort of philosopher who can program. There are a handful of them in the world, and he has lots of interesting ideas that nobody's gotten to carry out. So I recommend. Who else is-- Pat, do you ever recommend anyone else? PAT: No. PROFESSOR: What? I'm trying to think.", "start": 1260.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " I mean, if you're looking for philosophers, Dan Dennett has a lot of ideas. But Sloman is the only person, I'd say, is a sort of real professional philosopher, who tries to program, at least, some of his ideas. And he has successful students, who have made larger systems work. So if you get tired of me, and you ought to, then go look at this guy, and see who he recommends. OK, who has a good question to ask? AUDIENCE: So Marty, I'm talking about how we have a lot of words for emotions. Why can we only have one word for cause? PROFESSOR: It's a mystery, but I spent most of the couple of days making this list bigger. But these aren't-- you know, these are things that you do when you're thinking. You make analogies. If you have multiple goals, you try to pick the most important one. Or in some cases, if you have several goals, maybe you should try to achieve the easiest one,", "start": 1350.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " and there's a chance that it will lead you into what to do about the harder ones. But a lot of people think mostly in England that logic is a good way to do reasoning, and that's completely wrong. Because in logic, first of all, you can't do analogies at all, except at a very high level. It takes four or five nested quantifiers to say, A is to B as C is to which of the following five. So I've never seen anyone do analogical thinking using formalogic, first order or higher order predicate calculus. What's logic good for? Its great after you've solved a problem. Because then you can formalize what you did and see if some of the things you did weren't unnecessary. In other words, after you've got the solution to a problem, what you've got by going through a big search, you finally found a path from A to Z. And now, you can see if the assumptions that you had to make to bridge all these various little gaps were all essential or not.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " Yes? AUDIENCE: What kind of examples would you say that logic came to analogies? Like, well, water is [INAUDIBLE] containment, like why [INAUDIBLE]? PROFESSOR: Well, because you have to make a list of hypotheses, and then let me see if I can find Evans. The trouble is-- darn, Evans name is in a picture. And Word can't look inside its pictures. Can PowerPoint find words in its illustrations? Why don't I use PowerPoint? Because I've discovered that PowerPoint can't read pictures made by other programs in the Microsoft Word suite. The drawing program in Word is pretty good, and then there's an operation in Word, which will make a PowerPoint out of what you drew. And it's 25 years since Microsoft hasn't fixed the fatal errors that it makes when you do that. In other words, I don't think that the PowerPoint and Word people communicate. And they both make a lot of money,", "start": 1530.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " so that might be that might be the reason. Where was I? AUDIENCE: Why logic can't do [INAUDIBLE].. PROFESSOR: Well, you can do anything in logic, if you try hard enough, but A is to B as C is to X is a four part relation. And you'd need a whole pile of quantifiers, and how would you know what to do next? Yes? AUDIENCE: Talk a bit about the situation in which we are able to perform some sort of action, like really fluently and really well, but we cannot describe what we're doing. And the example I give is, say, I'm an expert African drummer from Africa, and I can make these really complicated rhythms. But if you asked me, what did you just do? I had no idea how to describe it. And in that case, do you think the person is capable of-- I guess, do you think the person-- we can say that the person understands this, even though they cannot explain it. PROFESSOR: Well, if you take an extreme form of that, you can't explain why you used any particular word for anything. There's no reason. It's remarkable how well people can do in everyday life", "start": 1620.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " to tell people how they got an idea. But when you look at it, it doesn't say how you would program a machine to do it. So there's something very peculiar about the idea that-- it goes back to this idea that people have free will and so forth. Suppose, I say, look at this and say, this has a constriction at this point. Why did I say constriction? How do you get any-- how do you decide what word to use for something? You have no idea, so it's a very general question. It's not clear that the different parts of the frontal lobes, which might have something to do with making plans and analyzing certain kinds of situations, have any access to what happens in the Broca or-- what's the speech production area? Broca, and I'm trying to find the name of the other one. It's connected by a cable that's about a quarter inch thick. AUDIENCE: Is that the Wernicke? PROFESSOR: Wernicke, yeah. We have no idea how those work as far as I've never", "start": 1710.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " seen any publication in neuroscience that says, here's a theory of what happens in Wernicke's area. Have any of you ever seen one? What do those people think about it, what they'll tell you about? I was reading something, which said, it's going to be very hard to understand these areas. Because each neuron is connected to 100,000 little fibers. Well, some of them are. And I bet they don't do much, except sort of set the bias for some large collection of other neurons. But if you ask somebody, how did you think of such a word? They will tell you some story or anecdote. But they won't be able to describe some sort of procedure, which is, say, in terms of a language, like lisp. And say, I can't this and that, and I took the clutter of this in the car of that. And I put them in this register, and then I swapped that with-- You don't see theories of how the mind works in psychology today. The only parts are they know a little bit about some aspects of vision, because you can track the paths of images from the retina to what's called the primary visual cortex.", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " And people have been able to figure out what some of those cortical columns do. And if you go back to an animal, like the frog, then researchers, like [? Bitsey ?] and others, have figured out how the equivalent of the cerebellum in the frog. They've got almost the whole circuit of how when the frog sees a fly, it manages to turn its head that way, and stick its tongue out, and catch it. But in the case of a human, I've never seen any theory of how any person thinks of anything. There's artificial intelligence, which has high level theories of semantic representations. And there's neuroscience, which has good theories of some parts of locomotion and some parts of sensory systems. And to this day, there's nothing much in between. David, here, has decided to go from one to the other, and a former student of mine Bob Hearn has done a little bit on both. And I bet there are 20 or 30 people around the country, who are trying to bridge the gap between symbolic artificial intelligence and mappings of the nervous system. But it's very rare, and I don't know", "start": 1890.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " who you could ask to get support to work on a problem like that for five years. Yeah? AUDIENCE: So presumably to build a human life for artificial intelligence, we need to perfectly model our own intelligence, which means that we are the system. We ourself are the system that we're trying the understand. PROFESSOR: Well, it doesn't have to be exactly. I mean, people are different, and the typical person looks like they have 400 different brain centers doing slightly different things or very different things. And we have these examples. In many cases, if you lose a lot of your brain, you're very badly damaged. And in other cases, you recover and become just about as smart as you were. There's probably a few cases, where you got rid of something that was holding you back, but it's hard to prove that. We don't need a theory of how people work yet, and the nice thing about AI is that we could eventually get models, which are pretty good at solving what people call everyday common sense problems. And probably in many respects, they're not the way the human mind works, but it doesn't matter.", "start": 1980.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " But once you've got-- if I had a program, which was pretty good at understanding why you can pull with a string but not push, then there's a fair chance you could say, well, that seems to resemble what people do. I'll do this few psychological experiments and see what's wrong with that theory and how to change it. So at some point, there'll be people making AI systems, comparing them to particular people, and trying to make them fit. The trouble is nowadays, it takes a few months, if you get a really good new idea, to program it. I think there's something wrong with programming languages, and what we need is a-- we need a programming language, where the instructions describe goals and then subgoals. And then finally, you might say, well, let's represent this concept by a number or a semantic network of some sort. Yes? AUDIENCE: That idea of having a programming language where you define goals. PROFESSOR: Is there a goal oriented language? AUDIENCE: So there is kind of one. If you think about it, if you squint hard enough at something, like SQL, where you tell it here, I want to find the top 10 people in my database", "start": 2070.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " with this high value. And then you don't worry about how the system goes about doing that. In a sense, that's redefining your goal [INAUDIBLE].. But you got to switch a little bit. PROFESSOR: What's it called? AUDIENCE: SQL. PROFESSOR: SQL. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] database and curates it [INAUDIBLE].. PROFESSOR: Oh, right. Yes, I guess database query languages are on the track, but Wolfram Alpha seems to be better than I thought. Well, he was running it, and Steve Wolfram was giving this demo at a meeting we were at on Monday. And he'd say, well, maybe I'll just say this, and it always worked. So maybe either the language is better than I thought, or Wolfram is better than I thought or something. Remarkable guy. Yes? AUDIENCE: So I liked this example of you only remember a name after you've given up consciously trying to think about it. Do you think this is a matter of us being able to set up back our processes, and then there's either some delay. Like we give off- there's some delay in the process, where we don't have the ability to correctly terminate processes.", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " Do you think this only works for memory, or could it work for other things? Like could I start an arithmetic operation, and then give up, and then it'll come to me later? PROFESSOR: Well, there's a lot of nice questions about things like that. How many processes can you run at once in your brain? And I was having a sort of argument the other day about music, and I was wondering if-- I see a big difference between Bach and the composers who do counterpoint. Counterpoint, you usually have several versions of a very similar idea. Maybe there's one theme, and you have it playing. And then another voice comes in. And it has that theme upside down, or a variation of it, or in some cases, exactly the same. And then it's called a canon. So the tour de force in classical music is when you have two, or three, or four versions of the same thought going on at once at different times. And my feeling was that in popular music, or if you take a typical band, then there", "start": 2250.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " might be four people. And they're doing different things at the same time. Usually, not the same musical tunes. But there's a rhythm, and there's a tympani. And there's various instruments doing different things, but you don't have several doing the same thing. I might be wrong, and somebody said, well, some popular music has a lot of counterpoint. I'm just not familiar with it. But I think that's-- if you're trying to solve a hard problem, it's fairly easy to look at the problem in several different ways. But what's hard is to look at it in several almost the same ways that are slightly different. Because probably, if you believe that the brain is made of agents, or resources, or whatever, you probably don't have duplicate copies of ones that do important things. Because that would take up too much real estate. Anyway, I might be completely wrong about jazz. Somebody, maybe they have just as complicated overlapping things as Bach and the contrapuntal composers did. Yeah? AUDIENCE: What is the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence? Is it some sort of application, or is it more philosophical?", "start": 2340.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " PROFESSOR: Oh, everyone has different goals or ones. AUDIENCE: In your opinion. PROFESSOR: I think we're going to need it, because the disaster that we're working our way toward is that people are going to live longer. And they'll become slightly less able, so we'll have billions of 200-year-old people who can barely get around. And there won't be enough people to import from underdeveloped countries to, or they won't be able to afford them. So we're going to have to have machines that take care of us. Of course, that's just a transient. Because at some point, then you'll download your brain into a machine and fix everything that's wrong. So we'll need robots for a few years or a few decades. And then we'll be them, and we won't need them anymore. But it's an important problem. What's going to happen in the next 100 years? You're going to have 20 billion 200-year-olds and nobody to take care of them, unless we get AI.

And nobody in the audience seemed interested, and I'd say, well, suppose you could live 400 years. And most of the people-- then I asked, what was the trouble? They said, wouldn't it be boring? So then I tried it, again, in a couple of other lectures. And if you ask a bunch of scientists, how would you like to live 400 hundreds years? Everyone says, yay, and you ask them why. And they say, well, I'm working on a problem that I might not have time to solve. But if I had 400 years, I bet I could get somewhere on it, and the other people don't have any goal. That's my cold blooded view of the typical non-scientist. There's nothing for them to do in the long run. Who can think of what should people do? What's your goal? How many of you want to live 400 years? Wow, there must be scientists here. Try it on some crowd and let me know what happens.", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " Are people really afraid. Yeah? AUDIENCE: I think the differentiating factor is whether or not your 400 years is just going to be the repetition of 100 years experience, or if it'll start to like take off, then you'll start to learn better. You'll progress. PROFESSOR: Right. I've seen 30 issues of the Big Bang, and I don't look forward to the next one anymore. Because they're getting to be all the same. Although, it's the only thing on TV that has scientists. Seriously, I hardly read anything, except journals and science fiction. Yeah? AUDIENCE: What's the motivation to have robots take care of as we age as opposed to enhancing our own cognitive abilities, or our prosthetic body, or something more societiable? What's the joy of living, if you can't do anything, and somebody takes care of you? PROFESSOR: I can't think of any advantage, except that medicine isn't getting-- you know, the age of unhandicapped people went up at one year every four since the late 1940s.

Nobody knows, but maybe there's just a dozen processes that would fix a lot of things. And then you could live longer without deteriorating, and lots of people might get bored. But they'll self select. I don't know. What's your answer? AUDIENCE: I feel that AI is more-- the goal is not to help take care of people, but to complement what we already have to entertain us.

It'd be nice to get a textbook on neurology from 50 years in the future, see how much of that stuff mattered. Where's our time machines? Did you have-- AUDIENCE: Yeah. Most systems have a state that they prefer to be in, like a state that they're most comfortable. Do you think the mind has such a state, or would it tend to certain places or something? PROFESSOR: That's an interesting. I don't-- how does that apply to living things? I mean, this battle would rather be here than here, but I'm not sure what you mean. AUDIENCE: Well, so apparently, in Professor Tenenbaum's class, he shows this example of a number game. They'll give you a sequence of numbers, and he'll ask you to find a pattern in it. So for example, if you had a pattern like 10, 40, 50,", "start": 5760.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " and 55, he asked the class to come up with different things that could be described in the sequence.

So that got me thinking, why would that be-- would our minds have a preference for having as few categories as possible in trying to view the world around us, trying to categorize things in as few things as possible is what got me thinking about it. PROFESSOR: Sounds very strange to me, but certainly, if you're going to generate hypotheses, you have to have-- the way you do it depends on what this-- what does this problem remind you of? So I don't see how you could make a general-- if you look at the history of psychology, there are so many efforts to find three laws of motion like Newton's.

And do you think that's something that we should fear? And if so, is there some way we can prevent it? PROFESSOR: If you judge by the recent-- by what's happened in AI since 1980, it's hard to imagine anything to fear. But-- AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING] PROFESSOR: But-- funny you should mention that.

And there are lots of good science fiction stories. My favorite is the Colossus series by DF Jones. Anybody know-- there was a movie called The Forbin Project, and it's about somebody who builds an AI, and it's trained to do some learning. And it's also the early days of the web, and it starts talking to another computer in Russia. And suddenly, it gets faster and faster, and takes over all the computers in the world, and gets control of all the missiles, because they're linked to the network. And it says, I will destroy all the cities in the world unless you clear off some island and start building the following machine. I think it's Sardinia or someplace. So they get bulldozers.
