theory of what\nmakes people able to solveso many kinds of problems.I guess, if you ran through the\nspectrum of all the animals,you'd find lots of problems\nthat some animals can solveand people can't, like how many\nof you could build a beaver damand/or termite nest.So there are all sorts\nof things that evolutionmanages to produce.But maybe the most\nimpressive oneis what the human\ninfant can do justby hanging around\nfor 10, or 20, or 30years and watching what\nother humans can do.So we can solve all\nsorts of problems,and my quarrel with most of\nthe artificial intelligencecommunity

Newton's three\nlaws, and Maxwell's fourlaws, and Einstein's\none law or two,that explained a huge range\nof everyday phenomena.Of course, in the\n1920s and '30s,that apple cart got upset.Actually, Einstein\nhimself, who had discoveredthe first quantum\nphenomena, namelythe quantization of\nphotons, had producedvarious scientific\nlaboratory observationsthat were inexplicable in\nterms of either Maxwell,or Newton, or Einstein's\nearlier formulations.So my picture of the history\nis that in the 19th centuryand a little bit earlier going\nback to Lock, and Spinoza,and Hume, and a few of\nthose philosophers, evenImmanuel Kant, they\nhad some pretty goodpsychological ideas.And as I mentioned\nthe other day,I suspect that\nAristotle was morelike a modern\ncognitive psychologistand had even better ideas.But we've probably\nlost a lot of them,because there are\nno tape recorders.Who knows what Aristotle and\nPlato said that their studentsdidn't write down?Because it sounded silly.",

response\nisn't good enough.The stimulus has\nto be representedby some kind of\nsemantic structuresomewhere in the brain or mind.So far as I know, it's\nonly in the theoriesof not even modern\nartificial intelligence,but the AI of the '60s,\nand '70s, and '80s,that people thought\nabout what couldbe the internal representation\nof the kinds of thingsthat we think about.And even more important, if\none of those representations,you see something, or you\nremember some incident.And your brain represents\nit in some way.And if that way doesn't\nwork, you take a breath.And you sort of stumble\naround and find another wayto represent it.Maybe when the original\nevent first happened,you represented it in\nthree or four ways.So we're beginning to see--did anybody hear Ferucci's
