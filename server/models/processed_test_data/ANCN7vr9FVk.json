slide\nhere I have a pictureof the Planck satellite,\nwhich is a satellite thatwas launched a few years\nago dedicated to measuringthe cosmic background radiation.Cosmic background\nradiation is reallyour biggest clue for the\nearly history of the universe.The Planck satellite is\nactually the third satelliteto go up completely dedicated to\nmeasuring the cosmic backgroundradiation.The first was called COBE\nand then WMAP and now Planck.Planck is still in orbit.It actually is finished\nwith its data-taking,although it's\nnowhere near finishedwith the analysis of that data.So they made one major\ndata release last March,and there are still very\nimportant pieces of their datathat I haven't looked at yet.And we'll be talking\nmore about what exactlythese satellites see.Onward.I want to begin by talking about\nthe standard Big Bang, whichwill in fact be the main\nfocus of this course.We'll probably spend about 2/3\nof the course or so talkingabout the standard Big\nBang and then move onto topics like inflation.That actually is, I think,\na very sensible balance,because as you'll see once we\nget under studying inflation,it's a fairly straightforward\nthing once you knowthe basic equations coming\nout of standard cosmology.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So I think spending about\n2/3 of the term or soon the conventional cosmology\nbefore we get to inflationis very sensible, because that\nwill set up all the principlesthat we'll be using\nlater to discuss moreadvanced topics like inflation.The conventional Big Bang\nmodel is basically the theorythat the universe as\nwe know it began some13 to 14 billion years ago.And now we even have a\npretty precise numberto replace this 13\nto 14 billion years.This is based on\nthe Planck satellitecombined with a few other\npieces of information.The number is 13.82 billion\nyears, plus or minus 0.05.So it's pretty well\npinned down now,the age of the universe\nsince the Big Bang.I should add, though, I put\nin the qualifier \"the universeas we know it.\"What that really means is\nthat I want to leave it out,because we don't really\nknow that the universe beganwith what we call the Big Bang.So we have a very good\npicture of the Big Bang,and we're very confident\nthat it happenedand that we understand\nwhat it looked like.But whether or not\nanything came before itis a much more open\nquestion which I thinkis really completely open.I think we should not act like\nwe know that the universe beganwith the Big Bang.And in fact later at the\nvery end of the course whenwe discuss some of the\nimplications of inflationand the multiverse,\nwe'll see that there arestrong suggestions that the\nBig Bang was perhaps not reallythe beginning of\nexistence, but reallyjust the beginning of\nour local universe,often called a pocket universe.OK.In any case, what the\nBig Bang theory tellsus is that at least our\nregion of the universe13.82 billion years ago was an\nextremely hot, dense, uniformsoup of particles, which in the\nconventional standard Big Bang", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "model filled literally\nall of space.And now we certainly believe\nit filled essentially allthe space that we have\naccess to uniformly.Now I should point\nout that this iscontrary to a popular cartoon\nimage of the Big Bang, whichis just plain wrong.The cartoon image\nof the Big Bangis the image of a small egg\nof highly dense matter thatthen exploded and spewed\nout into empty space.That is not the scientific\npicture of the Big Bang.And the reason is not\nbecause it's illogical.It's hard to know what's logical\nor illogical in this context.But simply based on\nwhat we see, if therewas a small egg that\nexploded into empty space,you would certainly\nexpect that today youwould see something different\nif you were looking toward wherethe egg was versus looking\nthe opposite direction.But we don't see any\neffect like that.When we look around\nthe sky, the universallooks completely uniform, on\naverage, in all directionsto very high degree of accuracy.I'll talk a little bit\nmore precisely later.So we don't see any sign of an\negg having happened anywhere.Rather the Big\nBang seems to havehappened everywhere uniformly.OK.The Big Bang describes a\nnumber of important things,and we'll be talking about this\nmore as the course goes on.It describes how the early\nuniverse expanded and cooled--and will be spending a fair\namount of time understandingthe details behind those words.The point is that\nthe Big Bang reallyis a very precise model based\non very simple assumptions.You basically assume\nthat the early universewas filled by a hot gas\nin thermal equilibrium.And that this gas was\nexpanding and being pulled backby gravity.And from those simple ideas\nyou can really calculate--and we'll learn\nhow to calculate--how fast the universe would\nhave been expanding at any given", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "instant of time, what the\ntemperature would have beenat any given instant of time,\nwhat the density of matterwould have been at\nany instant of time.So all the details\nreally can be calculatedfrom some rather\nsimple ideas, and we'llhave fun exploring that.The Big Bang also talks\nabout how the light chemicalelements formed.And that actually\nis the main topicof Steve Weinberg's book\n\"The First Three Minutes.\"Because that was more or less\nthe time period during whichthe chemical elements formed.It turns out that most of\nthe elements in the universedid not form in the Big\nBang, but formed much laterin the interior of stars.And those elements are\nthen strewn out into spacein supernova explosions and\ncollected into later generationstars, of which our\nsun would be one.So the stuff that we're made\nout of was actually not producedin the Big Bang, but\nrather was producedin the interior of some distant\nstar that exploded long ago.And maybe many\nstars, whose materialcollected to form\nour solar system.Nonetheless, most of the matter\nin the universe-- as opposedto most of the different\nkinds of elements--did form in the Big Bang.Most of the matter\nin the universeis just hydrogen and helium.About five different isotopes\nof hydrogen, helium, and lithiumwere primarily formed\nin the Big Bang,and because we do have this\ndetailed picture of the BigBang that we'll\nbe learning about,it's possible to\nactually calculatethe predicted abundances of\nthose different isotopes.And the predictions agree very\nwell with the observations.And this is certainly one\nof the major confirmationswe have that this picture\nof the Big Bang is correct.We can predict what the\nabundance of helium-3should be, and we measure\nit, and it agrees.It's rather marvelous.Finally-- and this\nsubject we're not", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "going to talk about\nmuch because itgoes beyond the\nlevel of complexitythat the course\nis going to have--but finally the Big\nBang does discusshow the matter ultimately\ncongealed to form stars,galaxies, clusters of galaxies.We'll talk about\nthat a little bit,but we won't really\nfollow that very far.That is still in principle\na work in progress.People do not understand\neverything about galaxies.But the general picture\nof that-- it started outwith an almost uniform\nuniverse, and thenthe lumps congealed to form the\ngalaxies and the structures--we say certainly seems\nto be a working picture.And one can understand\na lot about the universefrom this very simple picture.OK what I want to\ntalk about nextis what the conventional\nBig Bang theory does nottalk about, where new ideas\nlike inflation come in.First of all, the\nconventional Big Bang theorydoes not say anything about\nwhat caused the expansion.It really is only a theory\nof the aftermath of a bang.In the scientific\nversion of the Big Bang,the universe starts with\neverything already expandingwith no explanation of how\nthat expansion started.That's not part of\nthe Big Bang theory.So the scientific version\nof the Big Bang theoryis not really a\ntheory of a bang.It's really the theory of\nthe aftermath of a bang.In addition, and maybe\nin a similar vein,the conventional\nBig Bang theory saysnothing about where all\nthe matter came from.The theory really assumes that\nfor every particle that wesee in the universe\ntoday, there wasat the very beginning at\nleast some precursor particle,if not the same particle,\nwith no explanation of whereall those particles came from.In short, what I like to say is\nthat the Big Bang says nothingabout what banged,\nwhy it banged,or what happened\nbefore it banged.It really has no\nbang in the Big Bang.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "It's a bangless theory,\ndespite its name.Inflation, it turns out,\nfills in possible answers,very plausible answers, for\nmany of these questions.And that's what I'll\nbe talking about mainlyfor the rest of today.And as I said, in\nterms of the course,it's where we'll be aiming\nto get about 2/3 of the waythrough the semester.What is cosmic inflation?It's basically a\nminor modification,in terms of the overall\nscheme of things,of the standard Big Bang theory.And the best word to describe\nit is a word that I thinkwas invented by\nHollywood-- inflationis a prequel to the\nconventional Big Bang theory.It's a short description\nof what happened before,immediately before,\nthe Big Bang.So inflation really\nis an explanationof the bang of the\nBig Bang in the sensethat it does provide a\ntheory of the propulsion thatdrove the universe into this\nhumongous episode of expansionwhich we call the Big Bang.And it does it in\nterms of somethingthat I like to think of\nas a miracle of physics.When I use the word \"miracle\"\nin this context-- referringto a miracle in the\nscientific sense--simply something that's\nso surprising that I thinkit merits being called a miracle\neven though it's somethingthat's a part of\nthe laws of physics.There are just a few features\nof the laws of physicsthat are actually\ncrucial to inflation--I'll be talking\nabout two of them--which I consider miracles\nsimply because-- well,mainly because when I\nwas an undergrad nobodytalked about them at all.They were just not\npart of physics then,even though they really were.They just weren't\nparts of physics peoplenoticed and talked about.So the miracle of physics\nI'm talking about hereis something which\nactually is knownsince the time of Einstein's\ngeneral relativity--that gravity is not\nalways attractive.Gravity can act repulsively.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And Einstein introduced\nthis in 1916, I guess,in the form of what he called\nhis cosmological constant.And the original\nmotivation of modifyingthe equations of general\nrelativity to allow thiswas because Einstein thought\nthat the universe was static.And he realized that\nordinary gravitywould cause the universe to\ncollapse if it were static.It couldn't remain static.So he introduced this\ncosmological constant termto balance the overall\nattraction of ordinary gravityto be able to build a static\nmodel of the universe.As you'll soon be learning,\nthat's dead wrong.That's not what the\nuniverse looks like at all.But the fact that\ngeneral relativitycan support this\ngravitation repulsion, stillbeing consistent with\nall the principlesthat general relativity\nincorporates,is the important\nthing which Einsteinhimself did discover\nin this context.And inflation takes advantage\nof this possibility,within the context of\ngeneral relativity,to let gravity be the\nrepulsive force thatdrove the universe into\nthe period of expansionthat we call the Big Bang.And in fact when one\ncombines general relativitywith conventional ideas\nnow in particle physics,there really is a\npretty clear indication,I should say-- not quite a\nprediction-- but a pretty clearindication that at very\nhigh energy densities,one expects to find states of\nmatter which literally turngravity on its head and cause\ngravity to become repulsive.In terms of the details which\nwe'll be learning about morelater, what it takes to\nproduce gravitational repulsionis a negative pressure.According to general\nrelativity, it turns out--and we'll be talking more about\nthis later-- both pressuresand energy densities can\nproduce gravitational fields.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Unlike Newtonian physics,\nwhere it's only mass densitiesthat produce\ngravitational fields.And the positive\npressure producesan attractive\ngravitational field,which is what you would\nprobably guess if somebody justasked you to guess.Positive pressures are\nsort of normal pressures,and attractive gravity\nis normal gravity.So normal pressures\nproduce normal gravity.But it is possible to\nhave negative pressures,and negative pressures\nproduce repulsive gravity.That's the secret of what\nmakes inflation possible.So inflation proposes that\nat least a small patchof this repulsive\ngravity materialexisted in the early universe.We don't really\nknow exactly whenin the history of the\nuniverse inflation happened,which is another way of\nsaying we don't know exactlyat what energy scale\ninflation happened.But a very logical,\nplausible choice--I don't know if logical is\nthe right word, but plausibleis a good word--\nvery plausible choicefor when inflation\nmight have happened,would be when the energy\nscales of the universe whereat the scale of grand\nunified theories.Grand unified theories-- we'll\ntalk about a little bit later--are theories which\nunify the weak, strong,and electromagnetic\ninteractions intoa single unified interaction.And that unification occurs at\na typical energy of about 10to the 16 GeV, where GeV,\nin case you don't know,is about the mass--\nor the energyequivalent of the\nmass-- of a proton.So we're talking\nabout energies thatare about 10 to the 16 times the\nequivalent energy of a protonmass.And at those energies we\nthink that these states thatcreate repulsive gravity\nare very likely to exist.And if that happened\nat that scale,the initial patch\nwould only haveto be the ridiculously\nsmall size of about 10to the minus 28\ncentimeters acrossto be able to lead ultimately\nto the creation of everything", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "that we see on the vast\nscale at which we see it.The patch certainly does not\nhave to be the entire universe.And it could in fact\nbe incredibly rare,because one thinks that outside\nof that patch essentiallynothing will happen interesting.So we expect that the\nuniverse that we observe todaywould be entirely the\nconsequence of such a patch.The gravitational\nrepulsion createdby this small patch of\nrepulsive gravity materialwould be then the driving\nforce of the Big Bang,and it would cause the region to\nundergo exponential expansion.And by exponential expansion,\nas you probably know,it means that there's a\ncertain doubling time,and if you wait the same amount\nof time it doubles again.If you wait the same amount\nof time, it doubles again.And because these doublings\nbuild up so dramatically,it doesn't take very much time\nto build the whole universe.In about 100 doublings,\nthis tiny patchof 10 to the minus\n28 centimeterscan become large enough\nnot to be the universe,but to be a small marble\nsize region, which will thenultimately become\nthe observed universeas it continues to coast\noutward after inflation ends.So the doubling time\nwould be incredibly smallif this was all happening\nat the grand unified theoryset of numbers-- 10 to the\nminus 37 seconds, whichis pretty fast.The patch would\nexpand exponentiallyby at least a factor of about 10\nto the 28, which as I mentionedtakes only about 100\ndoublings, and couldexpand to be much more.There's no cut off there.If there's more\nexpansion than weneed to produce our\nuniverse, it justmeans that the patch of\nuniverse that we're living inis larger than we see.But that's OK.Everything that we see looks\nuniform as far as we can see,and how much there is\nbeyond that we really justhave no way of knowing.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So larger amounts\nof inflation areperfectly consistent\nwith what we see.The amount of time it would\ntake would only be about 10to the minus 35 seconds,\nwhich is just 100 times 10to the minus 37 if you can do\nthat complicated arithmeticin your head.And the region that's destined\nto become our presentlyobserved universe at\nthe end of inflationwould have been only about the\nsize of a marble-- about onecentimeter or so across.Now what ends\ninflation is the factthat this repulsive gravity\nmaterial is unstable.So it decays, using the\nword decay in the same sensethat a radioactive\nsubstance decays.It doesn't necessarily\nmean exactlythat it rots like\nan apple decays,but it means that it turns\ninto other kinds of material.And in particular, it\nturned into materialwhich is no longer\ngravitationally repulsive.So the gravitational repulsion\nends, and in fact the particlesproduced by this\nenergy that's releasedat the end of inflation\nbecome the hot soupof the conventional Big Bang.And this is where\nthe prequel ends,and the main feature begins--\nthe conventional Big Bangtheory.The role of inflation is just\nto set up the initial conditionsfor the conventional\nBig Bang theory.Now there's a\nlittle caveat here.Inflation ends because\nthe material is unstable,but it only ends\nalmost everywhere, notquite everywhere.And this is basically the\nway exponentials work.And we'll come back to this\nwhen we talk about the late timebehavior and the idea\nof eternal inflation.This repulsive gravity\nmaterial decays,but it decays like a radioactive\nsubstance-- which is alsoan exponential-- as a half life.But no matter how many\nhalf lives you wait,there's still a tiny little bit,\na tiny fraction that remains.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And that turns out to be\nimportant for the ideathat in many cases inflation\nnever completely ends.We'll come back to that.So I want to talk more\nabout what goes onduring this exponential\nexpansion phase.There's a very peculiar\nfeature of this inflation--this exponential\nexpansion drivenby repulsive gravity-- which\nis that while it's happening,the mass density\nor energy densityof the inflating material-- this\nrepulsive gravity material--does not decrease.You would think that if\nsomething doubled in radius,it would multiply by a\nfactor of eight in volume.You would think the energy\ndensity would go downby a factor of eight.And that certainly happens\nfor ordinary particles.It's certainly what\nwould happen if youhad a gas, an ordinary\ngas, that you justallowed to expand\nby a factor of twoin radius-- the density would\ngo down by a factor of eightwith volumes of\ncubes of distances.But this peculiar repulsive\ngravity material actuallyexpands at a constant density.Now that sounds like it must\nviolate conservation of energy,because it really does mean\nthat the total amount of energyinside this expanding\nvolume is increasing.The energy per volume\nis remaining constant,and the volume is getting\nbigger and bigger exponentially.So the claim is that I've not\ngone crazy, that this actuallyis consistent with the laws\nof physics as we know them.And that it is consistent\nwith conservation of energy.Conservation of energy really is\na sacred principle of physics.We don't know of anything\nin nature that violates thisprinciple of\nconservation of energy,that energy ultimately cannot\nbe either made or destroyed,that the total amount of\nenergy is basically fixed.So it sounds like there's\na contradiction here.How do we get out of it?What's the resolution?Well, this requires my\nsecond miracle of physics.Energy-- it really\nis exactly conserved.I'm not going to tell you\nabout any miracles which", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "changed that.But the catch here is\nthat energies are notnecessarily positive.There are things that\nhave negative energies.And in particular, the\ngravitational fieldhas a negative energy.This statement by the way is\ntrue both in Newtonian physicsand in general relativity.We'll prove it later.I might just say\nquickly if some of youhave learned in an E&M course\nhow to talk about and calculatethe energy density of an\nelectrostatic field-- probablymany of you have,\nmaybe all of youhave-- the energy density\nof an electrostatic fieldis a constant times the square\nof the electric field strength.And you can prove that\nenergy is exactly the energythat you need to\nput into a systemto create an electric field\nof a given configuration.If you think about\nNewton's law of gravityand compare it\nwith Coulomb's law,you realize that it\nreally is the same law,except they have a different\nconstant in front of them.They're both inverse\nsquare laws in proportionto the two charges, where\nin the case of gravityit's the masses that\nplay the role of charges.But they have opposite signs.Two positive charges, as we\nall know we tell each other,two positive masses\nattract each other.So in fact the\nvery same argumentwhich allows you to calculate\nthe energy density of a Coulombfield can allow you to\ncalculate the energydensity of a Newtonian\ngravitational field-- stillsticking to Newtonian\nphysics-- and this changein sign of the force\njust carries through.It changes the signs of all\nthe work that's being done,and you get the\nnegative answer thatis the correct answer\nfor Newtonian gravity.The energy density of a\nNewtonian gravitational fieldis negative.And the same is true\nin general relativityin a more subtle way.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So what that means in terms\nof conservation of energyis that we can have more\nand more matter, moreand more energy building up in\nthe form of ordinary matter--which is what happens during\ninflation-- as long as there'sa compensating amount\nof negative energythat's created in the\ngravitational field whichis filling this ever\nlarger region of space.And that's exactly what\nhappens in inflation.The positive energy of this\nrepulsive gravity materialwhich is growing and\ngrowing in volumeis precisely canceled\nby the negative energyof the gravitational field\nthat's filling the region.So the total energy\ndoes remain constant,as it must, and there's\ncertainly a good possibilitythat the total energy\nis exactly zero.Because everything\nthat we know ofis at least consistent\nwith the possibilitythat these two\nnumbers are exactlyequal to each other or\nsomething very close.Schematically, the picture\nis that if one thinksabout the total energy\nof the universe,it consists of a huge positive\namount in the form of matterand radiation-- the\nstuff that we see,the stuff that we\nnormally identifythe energy of-- but there's\nalso a huge negative amountof energy in the gravitational\nfield that fills the universe.And as far as we\ncan tell, the sumis at least consistent\nwith being 0.In any case, what\nhappens during inflationis the black bar goes up\nand the red bar goes down.And they go up and\ndown by equal amounts.So certainly what happens during\ninflation conserves energy,as anything consistent with the\nlaws of physics that we know ofmust conserve energy.I just remembered I was planning\nto turn out these blackboardlights.It probably makes it a\nlittle more comfortableto watch the screen.OK.So, onward.I want to talk some about\nthe evidence for inflation.So far I've described\nwhat inflation is--", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and I'm sort of done describing\nwhat inflation is for today.As I said, we'll be coming\nback and talking about all thisduring the coming semester.Now let's move on to\ndiscuss some of the reasonswhy we think that our universe\nmay very likely have actuallyundergone this process\ncalled inflationI was just telling you about.So there are three things\nI want to talk about.The first of which is the\nlarge scale uniformityof the universe.Which is related to what I\ntold you at the beginning,that if you look out\nin different directionsin the universe, it really looks\nthe same in all directions.And the object that can\nbe measured with the mostprecision in terms of how\nthings vary with angle,is the cosmic\nbackground radiation--because we can measure\nit from all directions,and it's essentially\na uniform background.And when that's been\ndone, what's been foundis that the radiation is uniform\nto the incredible accuracyof about one part in\n100,000-- which reallyis a rather spectacular\nlevel of uniformity.So it means the universe really\nis rather incredibly uniform.I might mention one proviso here\njust to be completely accurate.When one actually just goes\nout and measures the radiation,one finds something-- one\nfinds an asymmetry that'slarger than what I just said.One finds an asymmetry\nof about 1 part in 1,000,with one direction being hotter\nthan the opposite direction.But that 1 part in 1,000 effect\nwe interpret as our motionthrough the cosmic background\nradiation, which makes itlook hotter in one\ndirection and colderin the opposite direction.And the effect of our motion\nhas a very definite angularpattern.We have no other way of\nknowing what our velocity isrelative to the cosmic\nbackground radiation.So we just measure it\nfrom this asymmetry,but we're restricted.We can't let it\naccount for everything.Because it has a very\ndifferent angular form,we only get to\ndetermine one velocity.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And once we determine that,\nthat determines one asymmetryand you can subtract that out.And then the\nresidual asymmetries,the asymmetries that we cannot\naccount for by saying thatthe Earth has a certain\nvelocity relative to the cosmicbackground radiation, those\nasymmetries are at the levelof 1 part in 100,000.And this is 1 part in\n100,000 that we attributeto the universe and not to\nthe motion of the earth.OK.So to understand\nthe implicationsof this incredible\ndegree of uniformity,we need to say a\nlittle bit about whatwe think the history of this\ncosmic background radiationwas.And what our theories\ntell us-- and we'llbe learning about\nthis in detail--is that in the\nearly period-- Yes.AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.I'm curious.When they released\nWMAP and stuff,did they already subtract\nout the relativistic effect?PROFESSOR: Well, the answer\nis that they analyze thingsaccording to angular\npatterns and howthey fit different\nangular patterns.So in fact, I think they don't\neven report it with WMAP,but it would be what\nthey would call Lequals 1, the dipole term.They analyze the dipole,\nquadrupole, octupole, etcetera.So it really does not\ncontribute at all to anythingexcept that L\nequals 1 term, whichis one out of 1,800\nthings that they measure.So basically, I\nthink they don't evenbother reporting\nthat one number,and therefore it's\nsubtracted out.OK.Do feel free to ask\nquestions, by the way.I think it's certainly\na small enough classthat we can do that.OK.So what I was about to\nsay is that this radiationduring the early period of the\nuniverse, when the universe wasa plasma, the radiation\nwas essentiallylocked to the matter.The photons were moving\nat the speed of light,but in the plasma there's\na very large cross section", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.121}, {"text": "for the photons to scatter\noff of the free electronsin a plasma.Which basically means that the\nphotons move with the matter--because when they're\nmoving on their own,they just move a\nvery short distanceand then scatter, and then\nmove in a different direction.So relative to the\nmatter, the photonsgo nowhere during the\nfirst 400,000 yearsof the history of the universe.But then at about 400,000\nyears the universecools enough-- this\nis all accordingto our calculations--\nthe universe coolsenough so that the\nplasma neutralizes.And when the plasma neutralizes,\nit becomes a neutral gaslike the air in this room.And the air in this room seems\ncompletely transparent to us,and it turns out\nthat actually doesextrapolate to the universe.The gas that filled the universe\nafter it neutralized reallywas transparent, and it means\nthat a typical photon that wesee today in the cosmic\nbackground radiationreally has been traveling on\na straight line since about400,000 years\nafter the Big Bang.Which in turn means that when\nwe look at the cosmic backgroundradiation, we're\nessentially seeingan image of what the universe\nlooked like at 400,000 yearsafter the Big Bang.Just as the light traveling\nfrom my face to your eyesgives you an image\nof what I look like.So that's what we're seeing--\na picture of the universeat the age of 400,000\nyears, and it'sbland-- uniform to\n1 part in 100,000.So the question then\nis, can we explainhow the universe\nto be so uniform?And it turns out that if you--\nWell, I should say first of allthat if you're\nwilling to just assumethat the universe started out\nperfectly uniform to betterthan one part in\n100,000, that's OK.Nobody could stop\nyou from doing that.But if you want to try to\nexplain this uniformity", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "without assuming that it was\nthere from the beginning, thenwithin the context of the\nconventional Big Bang theory,it's just not possible.And the reason is that within\nthe evolution equationsof the conventional Big Bang\ntheory, you can calculate--and we will calculate\nlater in the course--that in order to smooth things\nout in time for it to looksmooth in the cosmic\nbackground radiation,you have to be able to move\naround matter and energyat about 100 times\nthe speed of light.Or else you just couldn't do it.And we don't know of anything\nin physics that happens fasterthan the speed of light.So within physics as we know it,\nand within the conventional BigBang theory, there's no way to\nexplain this uniformity exceptto just assume that maybe it was\nthere from the very beginning.For reasons that we\ndon't know about.On the other hand, inflation\ntakes care of this very nicely.What inflation does\nis it adds this spurtof exponential expansion to\nthe history of the universe.And the fact that this\nexponential expansionwas so humongous\nmeans that if youlook at our picture\nof the universebefore the inflation\nhappened, the universewould have been vastly smaller\nthan in conventional cosmologywhich would not have this\nexponential spurt of expansion.So in the inflationary\nmodel therewould've been plenty of\ntime for the observedpart of the universe to become\nuniform before

piecesof evidence for inflation.The second one is something\ncalled the flatness problem.And the question is, why was\nthe early universe so flat?And the first question\nmaybe is, what am Italking about when I say\nthe early universe was flat?One misconception\nI sometimes findpeople getting is that flat\noften means two dimensional.That's not what I mean.It's not flat like a\ntwo dimensional pancake.It's three dimensional.The flat in this context\nmeans Euclidean--obeying the axioms of\nEuclidean geometry-- as opposedto the non-Euclidean\noptions thatare offered by\ngeneral relativity.General relativity allows three\ndimensional space to be curved.And if we only consider uniform\ncurvature, which is-- wedon't see any\ncurvature, actually,but-- We know with\nbetter accuracythat the universe is uniform\nthan we do that it's flat.So imagine in terms of\ndiscussion of cosmologythree possible curvatures for\nthe universe, all of whichwould be taken to be uniform.Three dimensional curved spaces\nare not easy to visualize,but all three of\nthese are closelyanalogous to two dimensional\ncurved spaces, whichare easy to think about.One is the closed geometry\nof the surface of a sphere.Now the analogy is that the\nthree dimensional universe", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.128}, {"text": "would be analogous to\nthe two dimensionalsurface of a

that if youput a triangle on the\nsurface of a sphere,the sum of the three\nangles at the verticeswould be more than 180 degrees.Unlike the Euclidean case,\nwhere it's always 180 degrees.Question?AUDIENCE: Yeah.Is the 3D curving happening\nin a fourth dimension?Just like these 2D models\nassume another dimension?PROFESSOR: Good question.The question was,\nis the 3D curvaturehappening in a fourth dimension\njust like this 2D curvatureis happening in a\nthird dimension?The answer I guess is yes.But I should maybe clarify\nthe \"just like\" part.The third dimension here from\na strictly mathematical pointof view allows us to visualize\nthe sphere in an easy way,but the geometry of the\nsphere from the point of viewof people who study differential\ngeometry is a perfectly welldefined two dimensional\nspace without any needfor the third\ndimension to be there.The third dimension is\nreally just a crutch for usto visualize it.But that same crutch does work\nin going from three to four.And in fact when we study the\nthree dimensional curved spaceof the closed universe, we will\nin fact do it exactly that way.We'll introduce the same crutch,\nimagine it in four dimensions,and it will be very closely\nanalogous to the twodimensional picture\nthat you're looking at.OK.So one of the possibilities\nis a closed geometrywhere the sum of the\nthree angles of a triangleis always bigger\nthan 180 degrees.Another possibility\nis something that'susually described\nas saddle shaped,or a space of\nnegative curvature.And in that case the sum\nof the three angles--", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.159}, {"text": "they get pinched, and\nthe sum of the anglesis less than 180 degrees.And only for the flat case is\nthe sum of the three anglesexactly 180

in three dimensional\nspace, that's still Euclidean.But the restricted geometry to\nthe two dimensional surfacesare non-Euclidean there and\nthere, but Euclidean there.And that's exactly the way it\nworks in general relativity.There are closed universes with\npositive curvature and the sumof angles being more\nthan 180 degrees.And there are open universes\nwhere the sum of three anglesis always less than 180 degrees.And there's the\nflat case-- whichis just on the\nborderline of those two--where Euclidean geometry works.And the point is\nthat in our universe,Euclidean geometry\ndoes work very well.That's why we all learned\nit in high school.And in fact we have\nvery good evidencethat the early universe\nwas rather extraordinarilyclose to this flat case\nof Euclidean geometry.And that's what we're trying\nto understand and explain.According to general relativity\nthis flatness of the geometryis determined by\nthe mass density.There's a certain value\nof the mass density

critical\ndensity is the densitywhich makes the universe flat.And cosmologists define a number\ncalled omega-- capital omega--which is just the ratio\nof the actual massdensity to the\ncritical mass

the early universewas just slightly\ngreater than 1,it would rapidly rise\ntowards infinity.And this is a closed universe.Infinity really means\nthe universe has reachedits maximum size, and it\nturns around and collapses.And if omega was\nslightly less than 1,it would rapidly\ndribble off to 0,and the universe would\njust become emptyas it rapidly expands.So the only way for omega\nto be close to

omegastart out so\nincredibly close to 1?Like the earlier problem\nabout homogeneity,if you want to just assume\nthat it started out-- exactlylike, it had to be-- at omega\nequals 1, you could do that.But if you want to have any\ndynamical explanation for howit got to be that\nway, there's reallynothing in conventional\ncosmology which does it.But in fact, inflation does.In the inflationary model we've\nchanged the evolution of omegabecause we've turned gravity\ninto a repulsive force insteadof an attractive force, and that\nchanges the way omega evolves.And it turns out that\nduring inflation, omegais not driven away\nfrom 1-- as itis during the entire rest of\nthe history of the universe--but rather during inflation\nomega is driven rapidlytowards 1, exponentially\nfast, even.So

that's-- Oh, I\nhave a few more things to say.There's actually a prediction\nthat comes out of this,because this tendency of\ninflation to drive omega to 1is so strong, that you\nexpect that omega reallyshould be 1 today.Or to within\nmeasurable accuracy.You could arrange\ninflationary modelswhere it's say, 0.2--\nwhich is what people usedto think it was-- but in order\nto do that, you have to arrangefor inflation to end\nat just the right timebefore it makes it closer.Because every e-fold drives it\nanother factor of 10 closer.So it's very rapid effect.So if you don't fine tune\nthings very carefully, mostany inflationary model will\ndrive omega so close to 1that today we would see it as 1.That did not used to\nappear to be the case.Before 1998 astronomers\nwere pretty surethat omega was only 0.2 or\n0.3, while inflation seemedto have a pretty clear\nprediction that omega shouldbe 1.This personally I found rather\nuncomfortable, because it meantwhenever I had dinner\nwith astronomers,they would always sort\nof snidely talk abouthow inflation was\na pretty theory,but it couldn't be right\nbecause omega was 0.2,and inflation was\npredicting omega is 1.And it just didn't fit.Things changed a lot in 1998,\nand now the best number wehave-- which comes from the\nPlanck satellite combined witha few other\nmeasurements, actually--is that now the observational\nnumber for

ingredient that\nmade all this possible,that drove-- changed\nthe measurement of omegafrom 0.2 to 1 is\na new ingredientto the energy budget of the\nuniverse, the discovery of whatwe call dark energy.And we'll be learning\na lot about dark energyduring the course of the term.The real discovery in 1998\nwas that the universe is notslowing down under the\ninfluence of gravityas had been expected until that\ntime, but rather the universeactually is accelerating.And this acceleration has to\nbe attributed to something.The stuff that it's attributed\nto is called the dark energy.And even though there's\nconsiderable ignoranceof what exactly\nthis dark energy is,we can still calculate\nhow much of itthere's got to be in order to\nproduce the acceleration that'sseen.And when all that\nis put together,you get this number, which is\nso much nicer for inflationthan the previous number.Yes.AUDIENCE: So, was the\naccelerating universelike the missing factor which\nthey-- gave a wrong assumptionwhich made them think\nthat omega was 0.2 or 0.3?PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.It was entirely\nbecause they did notknow about the\nacceleration at that time.They in fact were accurately\nmeasuring the stuffthat they were looking at.And that does only\nadd up to 0.2 or 0.3.And this new ingredient,\nthe dark energy,which we only know about\nthrough the acceleration,is what makes the difference.Yes.AUDIENCE: And that data\nthat they were measuringis really just sort of\nthe integrated stuffin the universe that we\nsee through telescopes?", "start": 2760.0, "heat":

matter is\nmatter that we inferexists due to its\neffect on other matter.So by looking, for example,\nat how fast galaxies rotate,you can figure out\nhow much matterthere must be inside\nthose galaxiesto allow those\norbits to be stable.And that's significantly more\nmatter than we actually see.And that unseen matter is\ncalled the dark matter,and that was added\ninto the 0.2 or 0.3.The

incredibly uniform-- one\npart in 100,000-- but on smallerscales, the universe\ntoday is incredibly lumpy.The earth is a big lump\nin the mass densitydistribution of the universe.The earth is in

are confident that\nthese lumps evolvedfrom the very\nminor perturbationsthat we see in the\nearly universe,that we see most clearly\nthrough the cosmic backgroundradiation.The early universe we believe\nwas uniform in its mass densityto about one part in 100,000.But at the level of\none part in 100,000,we actually see in the\ncosmic background radiationthat there are nonuniformities.And

believe,\nshortly after the Big Bang.And we see these nonuniformities\nin the cosmic backgroundradiation, and\nmeasuring them tells usa lot about the\nconditions of the universethen, and allows us\nto build theoriesof how the universe\ngot to be that way.And that's what these satellites\nlike COBE, WMAP, and Planckare all about-- measuring\nthese nonuniformitiesto rather\nextraordinary

life.But the half that remains\nwill be vastly largerthan what you started with.That's the catch.And that's a very\npeculiar situationbecause it doesn't\nseem to show any end.The volume that's

vacuum,is a very complicated state.It's not really empty at all.It really is a complicated\njumble of vacuum fluctuations.We think there's even a field\ncalled the Higgs field, whichyou've

understand its value.The real problem from the point\nof view of fundamental physicstoday is not understanding\nwhy the vacuum mighthave a nonzero energy density.The problem is understanding\nbasically why it's so small.And why is smallness a problem?If you look at quantum field\ntheory-- which we're notgoing to learn in any detail--\nbut quantum field theorysays that, for

the energydensity of the vacuum in\nthe quantum field theory,it diverges on the\nshort wavelength side.It becomes literally infinite\nas far as the formal calculationis concerned because

off the\ninfinity is the effectsof quantum gravity, which\nwe don't understand.So one way of estimating\nthe true energy densityas predicted by\nquantum field theoryis to cut things off at the\nPlanck

show.But I think it's an interesting\nstory worth finishing.But to come to a good\nstopping place here--we still have a minute\nand a half, I think.I want to say a little bit about\nthe landscape of string theory,which is going to be a possible\nexplanation-- only possible,it's very speculative here-- but\none possible explanation whichcombines inflation, the eternal\ninflation, and string theoryproduces a possible explanation\nfor this very small vacuumenergy that we observe.It's based on the idea\nthat string theory does nothave the unique vacuum.For many years string\ntheorists soughtto find the vacuum of string\ntheory with no success.They just couldn't\nfigure out whatthe vacuum of string\ntheory would look like.And then a little more than 10\nyears ago many string theoristsbegan to converge\naround the ideathat maybe they could not\nfind a vacuum because thereis no unique vacuum\nto string theory.Instead, what they now\nclaim is that there'sa colossal number-- they\nbandy around numbers like 10to the 500th power-- a colossal\nnumber of metastable states,which are long lived,\nany one of whichcould look like a vacuum\nfor a long period of time,even though ultimately it\nmight decay or tunnel into oneof the other metastable states.So this is called the\nlandscape of string theory.This huge set of\nvacuum like states,any one of which could be\nthe vacuum that fills a givenpocket universe, for example.When one combines this with\nthe idea of eternal inflation,then one reaches the conclusion\nthat eternal inflation", "start": 3960.0, "heat": 0.105}, {"text": "would very likely\npopulate all of these 10to the 500 or more vacua.That is, different\npocket universeswould have different kinds\nof vacuum inside them, whichwould be determined randomly as\nthe pocket universes nucleate,as they break off from\nthis inflating backbone.And then we would\nhave a multiversewhich would consist\nof many, many-- 10to the 500 or more--\ndifferent kinds of vacuain different pocket universes.Under this assumption,\nultimately string theorywould be the assumed\nlaws of physicsthat would govern everything.But if you were living in one\nof these pocket universes,you actually see apparent laws\nof physics that would look verydifferent from other\npocket universe's.The point is that the\nphysics that we actuallysee and measure is low energy\nphysics compared to the energyscales of the string theory.So what we are seeing are\njust small fluctuationsin the ultimate scheme of\nthings about the vacuumthat we live in.So the very particle\nspectrum that we see,the fact that we see\nelectrons and quarks, quarksthat combine to form\nprotons and neutrons--could be peculiar to\nour particular pocket.And in other pockets there could\nbe completely different kindsof particles, which\nare just oscillationsabout different kinds of vacuum.So even though the\nlaws of physicswould in principle be\nthe same everywhere--the laws of string\ntheory-- in practice theobserved laws of\nphysics would bevery different from\none pocket to another.And in particular\nsince there aredifferent vacua in\nthe different pockets,the vacuum energy\ndensity would bedifferent in different pockets.And that variability of\nthe vacuum energy densityprovides a possible answer to\nwhy we see such a small vacuumenergy.And we'll talk more about\nthat next time on
