beyond that.It may have no logical\ndeductions potentially.It may have no assumptions.Any thoughts about a proof?OK, well, I think\ngenerally, a proofis considered, across\nmultiple fields,as a method

equals 5.Now, that's a true proposition.Here's one that's a\nlittle more interesting.For all n in the set\nof natural numbers,n squared plus n plus\n41 is a prime number.I know I've used\nsome

you\nover the head with it.Here's a famous in\nmathematics statement.a to the fourth plus b to the\nfourth plus c to the fourthequals d to the fourth has no\npositive integer solutions.That is a proposition.Now, this proposition was\nconjectured to be true by Eulerin 1769.Euler's a big honcho in math.We still talk about him\na lot even though he'sbeen dead for centuries.It was unsolved for\nover 2 centuries.Mathematicians worked on it.It was finally disapproved\nby a very clever fellownamed Noam Elkies 218 years\nlater after it was conjectured.He worked at that other\nschool down the street.And he came up with this.a equals 95,800.b equals 217,519.c equals 414,560.You don't have to\nremember these numbers.We're not going to quiz\nyou on that-- 422,481.Now, he claims-- I've never\npersonally checked it,but presumably, people have--\nyou plug those in here,", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and you have an equality.So he says.So in fact, the\ncorrect propositionis there does exist a, b,\nc, d in the positive naturalnumbers such that a the fourth\nplus b to the fourth plusc to the fourth equals\nd to the fourth.I used a new quantifier\nhere called there exists.Instead of an\nupside down A, it'sa backwards E. Don't ask me why.That's what it is.The plus means you can't\nhave 0 or negative numbers.So these are the\npositive natural numbers.And here's your predicate, which\nof course, the truth of thisdepends on the values\nof a, b, c and d.It took a long time to figure\nout that actually, therewas a solution here.Obviously, everything they\ntried until that time failed.Let me give you another one.313 x cubed plus y cubed equals\nz cubed has no positive integersolutions.This turns out to be false.But the shortest,\nsmallest counter-examplehas over 1,000 digits.This one was easy.It only has six digits.So there's no way ever\nyou'd use a computerto exhaustively search\n1,000 digit numbers hereto show it's false.Now, of course, some of you are\nprobably thinking, why on earthwould I care if 313 times\nx cubed plus y cubed equalsz cubed has a solution?", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And that probably\nwon't be the last timethat thought occurs to\nyou during the term.And why on

an\nexample of what'scalled an elliptic\ncurve-- elliptic curve.You study these if you're really\na specialist in mathematicsin graduate school,\nor if you workfor certain\nthree-letter agenciesbecause it's central to\nthe understanding of howto factor large integers.That means factoring,\nshowing that-- what was it--1,681 is 41 times 41.And I said, OK, who\ncares about factoring?Well, factoring is the\nway to break cryptosystemslike RSA, which are\nused for everythingthat we do electronically today.You have a Paypal account.You buy something online.You're using SSL.They're all using cryptosystems,\nalmost all of whichare based on number theory.And in particular, they're\nbased on factoring.And if you can find good\nsolutions to things like this,or solutions to things\nlike this, all of a sudden,you can get an angle and\na wedge on factoring.And it's because\nof that that nowRSA uses 1,000 digit\nmoduluses instead of hundreddigit moduluses like\nthey used to use,because people figured\nout how to factorand how to break\nthe cryptosystem.If you could break\nthose cryptosystems,well, you can't rule the\nworld, but it's close.All right, so we'll\ntalk more about thisthe week after next when\nwe do number theory,and we work up to RSA and\nhow that cryptosystem works,and why factoring\nis so important.So yeah, you don't\nhave to really haveto worry

how the game\nworks in mathematics.You can get an\nidea of maybe it'strue, but doesn't\ntell you the answer.All right, let me\ngive you another one.This is another very famous\none that probably most of youhave heard of.The regions in any map can\nbe colored in four colorsso that adjacent regions\nhave different colors.Like a map of the\nUnited States--every state gets a color.If two states

theorem before?Yeah, OK.So you've all heard of it.It has a long history.It was conjectured by somebody\nnamed Guthrie in 1853.He's the first person to say\nthis ought to be possible.And there were many false\nproofs over the ensuing century.One of the most convincing\nwas a proof using picturesby Kempe in 1879,\n26 years later.And this proof was\nbelieved for over a decade.Mathematicians thought\nthe proof was rightuntil another mathematician\nnamed Heawood founda fatal flaw in the argument.Now, this proof\nby Kempe consistedof drawing pictures of what\nmaps have to look like.So he started by\nsaying, a map hasto look like one of these types.And he would draw\npictures of them.And then he argued that those\ntypes that he drew pictures of,it worked for.Proofs by picture are often\nvery convincing and very wrong.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And I'm going to give you one\nto start lecture next time.It'll be a proof by PowerPoint,\nwhich is even worse than proofby picture.And it is compelling.And the point will to be to\nshow you proofs by pictureare generally not a good thing.Because your brain\njust locks in-- oh,that's what it has to look like.And you don't think about other\nways that it might look like.Now, the four color\ntheorem was finallyproved by Appel\nand Haken in 1977,but they had to use a computer\nto check thousands of cases.Now, this was a little\ndisturbing to mathematicians,because how do they know the\ncomputer did the right thing?Your colleague writes\na proof on the board.You can check it.But how do you know the\ncomputer didn't mess up,or not do some cases?Now, everybody\nbelieves it's true now.But it's unsatisfying.A few years ago, a 12-page\nhuman proof was discovered,but it's not been verified.And people are very\nsuspicious of itbecause the proof of\nthe main lemma says,quote, \"details of this\nlemma is left to the reader.See figure seven.\"That's what the main\nlemma of the proof is.But people think\nthat maybe therewere some good ideas there,\nbut very suspicious proof.All right, let's do another\none, another proposition--also very famous.Every even integer\nbut 2-- actually,positive integer but 2--\nis the sum of two primes.For example, 24 is the sum of\n11 and 13, which are prime.Anybody know?Is this true or false,\nthis proposition?", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Yeah?AUDIENCE: I wish I knew.PROFESSOR: [LAUGHS]\nYeah, that's right.Me too.Nobody knows if this\nis true or false.This is called\nGoldbach's conjecture.It was conjectured by\nChristian Goldbach in 1742.This is a really\nsimple proposition.And it's amazing it's not known.In fact, I spent a couple\nyears working on-- I thought,oh, well, this has\nto be easy enoughto prove when I was younger,\nand didn't get very far.So people still don't\nknow if it's true.And in fact, it was\nlisted by the Globeas one of the great\nunsolved mysteries.So if you get out this Globe\narticle here, one of the hand--does everybody\nhave this handout?You don't?We'll get it passed out.Somebody missing that handout\nup over there and over here?All right, if we get\nthose passed out.Now, it lists the\nthree conjectures.Do you see Goldbach's\nconjecture there?Now, can anybody\npoint out somethingthat's a little disturbing\nabout what the Globe saysabout Goldbach's conjecture?AUDIENCE: 9 as a prime number.PROFESSOR: Yeah, it\ngives the example.Like, instead of\n24 is 11 plus 13,it says 20 is the\nsum of 9 and 11.Now, if we're allowed to\nuse things like 9 as primes,Goldbach's conjecture's\npretty easy to prove is true.This won't be the last\ntime we get examplesfrom the literature.In fact, we're going\nto do this a lot,along this theme of, you cannot\nbelieve everything you read.Now, the Globe is easy\npickings, but we'lldo some more\ninteresting ones later.Now, this article lists two\nother famous conjectureswhich most people believe to be\ntrue-- the Riemann hypothesisafter an 1859 paper\nwritten by Bernard Riemann", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "suggested that zeros in an\ninfinite series of numbersknown as a zeta

enough to\nprove it completely, of course.And then the-- no, actually,\nthe Riemann hypothesis,a couple years ago,\nsomebody credibleclaimed to have proved it.Proof turned out\nnot to be right.Then there's the\nPoincare conjecture.Now, this one was finished off.It was proved to be true\nin 2003 by a Russian namedGrigori Perelman.The conjecture says,\nroughly speaking,that 3D objects without\nholes, like no a doughnut,are equivalent to the sphere.They can sort of be\ndeformed into a sphere.This is known to be true in\nfour dimensions and higher,but nobody could prove\nit for three dimensionsuntil Perelman came along.Now, there's a bit of a\ncontroversy around this guy.He had an 80-page proof, but\ndidn't have all the details.So then other teams\nof mathematiciansgot together and wrote\n350 pages of details.And then most people\nbelieve now that it's right,and that his original\nproof might nothave had all the details, but\nhe had the right structureof the proof.So he won prizes for this.He won the highest prize in\nmathematics, the Fields Medal.And just earlier this year,\nhe was awarded the $1 millionMillennium Prize.And there's about\nsix problems or sothat if you solve one of them,\nthe Clay Institute gives youa million dollars.And he's the first one to\nwin the million dollars.Now, the guy's a little strange.He rejected the Fields Medal and\nrefused to go to the ceremonywhere he was being honored.And he's recently rejected\nthe Millennium prize.And anyway, this area's\nmurky, and we have an expertto explain it all\nfor us on video,which I thought I'd

You all saw this in\ngeometry in middle school,right?You've got a point in a line.There's exactly another\nline through the pointthat's parallel to the line.Now, there's also a field\ncalled spherical geometry.And there, you have an\naxiom that contradicts this.It says, given a line L\nand a point p not on L,there is no line through p\nparallel to L on the sphere.There's a field called\nhyperbolic geometry.And there, there's\nan axiom that says,given a line L and\na point p not on L,there are infinitely many\nlines through p parallel to L.So how can this be?Does that mean one of these\nfields is totally bogus,or two of them are?Because they've got\ncontradictory axes.That's OK.Just whatever field you're\nin, state you're axioms.And they do make sense\nin their various fields.This is planar geometry.This is on the sphere.And this is on\nhyperbolic geometry.They make sense\nin those contexts.So you can have more or less\nwhatever axioms you want.There are sort of two\nguiding principles to axioms.", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.348}, {"text": "Axioms should be-- it's called\nconsistent-- and complete.Now, a set of\naxioms is consistentif no proposition can be proved\nto be both true and false.And you can see why\nthat's important.If you spend three weeks\nproving something's true,and the next day, somebody\nproves it's also false,I mean, the whole\nthing was pointless.So it only makes sense if\nyour axioms, as a group,are consistent.A set of axioms is\nsaid to be completeif it can be used to\nprove every proposition iseither true or false.Now, this is desirable\nbecause it means-- well,you can solve every problem.Everything is-- you\ncan prove it's true,or you can prove it's false.You can get to the end.", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.36}, {"text": "Now, you'd think\nit shouldn't be toohard to get a set of axioms\nthat satisfies these twobasic properties.You're allowed to choose\nwhatever you want, really.Just, you don't want to be\ncreating contradictions.And you want a set\nthat's powerful enoughthat allows you to prove\neverything is true or false,one of the two.Turned out not to be\nso easy to do this.And in fact, many logicians\nspent their careers--famous logicians--\ntrying to finda set of axioms,\njust one set, thatwas consistent and complete.In fact, Russell and\nWhitehead are probablythe two most famous.They spent their entire\ncareers doing this,and they never got there.Then one day, this guy\nnamed Kurt Godel showed up.And in the 1930s, he\nproved it's not possiblethat there exists any\nset of axioms that areboth consistent and complete.Now, this discovery\ndevastated the field.It was a huge discovery.Imagine poor Russell\nand Whitehead.They spent their entire careers\ngoing after this holy grail.Then Kurt shows up\nand said, hey, guys.There's no grail.It doesn't exist.And that's a little\ndepressing-- pretty bad daywhen that happened.Now, it's an amazing\nresult, because itsays if you want consistency--\nand that's a must--there will be true facts\nthat you will neverbe able to prove.We're not going to\nprove that here.It's proved in a logic course.For example, maybe\nGoldbach's conjecture is trueand it is impossible to prove.Now, we're going to\ntry not to assign anyof those problems for homework.And in fact, they do exist.It's complicated.You can state a problem that you\ncan't prove is true or false.And you may be thinking\nthat from time to time.Hey, it's one of those.Remember when your parents told\nyou if you work hard enough,you can do anything?They were wrong.", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.521}, {"text": "All right, that's\nenough for now.And we'll do more\nof this next time.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.34}]
