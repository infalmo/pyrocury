[{"text": "PROFESSOR: So in\nquantum mechanics,you see this i appearing here,\nand it's a complex number--the square root of minus 1.And that shows that\nsomehow complex numbersare very important.Well it's difficult\nto overemphasizethe importance of i--is the square root of minus 1\nwas invented by people in orderto solve equations.Equations like x\nsquared equals minus 1.And it so happens\nthat once you invent iyou need to invent\nmore numbers, and youcan solve every polynomial\nequation with just i.And square root of i--\nwell square root of ican be written in terms\nof i and other numbers.So if you have a\ncomplex number z--we sometimes write\nit this way, and wesay it belongs to\nthe complex numbers,and with a and b belonging\nto the real numbers.And we say that\nthe real part of zis a, the imaginary\npart of z is b.We also define the\ncomplex conjugate of z,which is a minus i b and we\npicture the complex number zby putting a on the\nx-axis b on the y-axis,and we think of the\ncomplex number z here--kind of like putting\nthe real numbers hereand the imaginary parts here.So you can think\nof this as ib or b,but this is the complex number--\nmaybe ib would be a better wayto write it here.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.255}, {"text": "So with complex numbers, there\nis one more useful identity.You define the norm\nof the complex numberto be square root of a\nsquared plus b squaredand then this\nresults in the normsquared being a\nsquared plus b squared.And it's actually equal\nto z times z star.A very fundamental equation--z times z star--if you multiply z\ntimes z star, youget a squared plus b squared.So the norm squared--the norm of this thing\nis a real number.And that's pretty important.So there is one other\nidentity that is very usefuland I might well\nmention it here as we'regoing to be working\nwith complex numbers.And for more practice\non complex numbers,you'll see the homework.So suppose I have in the\ncomplex plane an angle theta,and I want to figure out what\nis this complex number z hereat unit radius.So I would know that it's real\npart would be cosine theta.And its imaginary part\nwould be sine theta.It's a circle of radius 1.So that must be\nthe complex number.z must be equal to cosine\ntheta plus i sine theta.Because the real part\nof it is cosine theta.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "It's in that horizontal\npart's projection.And the imaginary part is\nthe vertical projection.Well the thing that\nis very amazingis that this is equal\nto e to the i theta.And that is very non-trivial.To prove it, you\nhave to work a bit,but it's a very famous\nresult and we'll use it.So that is complex numbers.So complex numbers you use\nthem in electromagnetism.You sometimes use them\nin classical mechanics,but you always use it\nin an auxiliary way.It was not directly relevant\nbecause the electric fieldis real, the position is,\nreal the velocity is real--everything is real and\nthe equations are real.On the other hand,\nin quantum mechanics,the equation already has an i.So in quantum mechanics, psi is\na complex number necessarily.It has to be.In fact, if it would be real,\nyou would have a contradictionbecause if psi is\nreal, turns outfor all physical systems we're\ninterested in, H on psi realgives you a real thing.And here, if psi is real\nthen the relative is real,and this is imaginary and\nyou have a contradiction.So there are no\nsolutions that are real.So you need complex numbers.They're not auxiliary.On the other hand, you can\nnever measure a complex number.You measure real numbers--ammeter, position,\nweight, anything", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.192}, {"text": "that you really measure\nat the end of the dayis a real number.So if the wave function\nwas a complex number,it was the issue of what is\nthe physical interpretation.And Max Born had\nthe idea that youhave to calculate the\nreal number calledthe norm of this\nsquare, and this isproportional to probabilities.So that was a great\ndiscovery and had a lotto do with the development\nof quantum mechanics.Many people hated this.In fact, Schrodinger\nhimself hated it,and his invention of\nthe Schrodinger catwas an attempt to\nshow how ridiculouswas the idea of thinking of\nthese things as probabilities.But he was wrong, and Einstein\nwas wrong in that way.But when very good\nphysicists are wrong,they are not wrong\nfor silly reasons,they are wrong for good\nreasons, and we can learn a lotfrom their thinking.And this EPR are\nthings that we willdiscuss at some moment in\nyour quantum sequence at MIT.Einstein-Podolski-Rosen\nwas an attemptto show that quantum\nmechanics was wrongand led to amazing discoveries.It was the EPR paper\nitself was wrong,but it brought up\nideas that turned outto be very important.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.193}]
