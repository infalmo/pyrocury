smaller version.That was for six\nunits of a credit,and we had it once a week.And mostly practitioners\nfrom the industry,from Morgan Stanley,\ntalking about exampleshow math is applied\nin modern finance.And so we got some good\nresponse last year.So, with the support\nof the math department,we decided to expand this\nclass to be 12 units of creditand have twice a week.So, we have every Tuesday\nand Thursday afternoonfrom 2:30 to 4:00, as you\nknow, in this classroom.So last year, Dr. Vasily\nStrela and I-- by the way,I'm Jake Xia and\nthat's Dr. Vasily,and we were the main\ninstructors last year.Now we doubled it up to\nfour main instructors.That's Dr. Peter Kempthorne\nand Dr. Choongbum Lee.The reason we doubled\nup the main instructorsis we have newly added math\nlectures, mostly focusingfrom linear algebra,\nprobability to statistics,and some stochastic calculus\nto give you the foundationto understand the\nmath will be usedin those examples in the lecture\ntaught by the practitionersfrom the industry.And the purpose of\nthis course is reallyto give you a sampling menu to\nsee how mathematics is applied", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.343}, {"text":

coming\nto work in the industry.Some work at Morgan Stanley,\nsome work at elsewhere.So that's really the goal.And at the same\ntime, obviously, youwill further solidify\nyour math knowledgeand learn new content.And we put the prerequisite\nabout the math part a bitlater.So I will use today's\nfirst lecture's timeto give you an\nintroduction, really,to prepare you some basic\nbackground knowledgeabout the financial markets.Some terminologies\nwill be used, whichyou may not have heard before.So before I get into\nthe introduction,I always like to know who are\nactually in the classroom,so let me ask you\na few questions.You just need to\nraise your handsso I know roughly what kind of\nbackground and where you are.So how many undergraduate\nstudents are here?So I would say 80% percent.How many graduate students\nare here, just to verify?Yep, that's about right, 20%.And how many students are in\nfinance and business major?Just one.And how many of you\nare a math

actually\nwork right now.I forgot to mention\nthat, but I'maffiliated with both the math\ndepartment and the Sloan schoolhere.So anyway, thanks for that.We will be doing a bit\nmore polling along the way,mainly to get feedback of\nhow you feel about the class.Last year we had it\nonline, so if youfeel the class is\ngoing too fast,or the math part\nis going too slow,or the finance part\nis a bit

think about it,mathematical or quantitative\nfinance is a rather new field.A lot of these terms\nwere newly introduced.And the pricing model\nof options, as you know,was introduced in the\nBlack-Scholes in the '70s,or some of the ground work\nmay be done a bit earlier.But it's not like finance\nwas a quantitative professionto start with.So what we witness\nin the last 30 yearswas

these exchanges.That's one way of trading,\nwhich is centralized.Obviously, in the\nlast 10, 15 years,now we have ECNs,\nelectronic platforms.Trade over-- you know, even\nlarger volume of those trades.So, financial products is\nreally just one form of trading.There are many other ways of\ntrading aside from exchanges.One of them, which\nis called OTC,is over-the-counter, meaning\ntwo counterparties agreeto do a trade without really\nsubject to the exchange rules,or the underlying trading\nagreement does nothave to be a securitized\nproduct, or standardized,or whatever ways you define it.And the different regions\nhave different exchangesand markets, as well.And they typically specialize\nin local products, local companystocks, local bonds,\nand local currencies.So, there are many\ndifferent forms.So again, what's in common?That's the question\nyou need to ask.Also, you don't\nknow the specifics.And the currencies, money\nitself, are also traded.And that's

of banks.One is called commercial bank,\nthe other is investment bank.Commercial bank is\nsupposedly, you'retaking deposits and\nlend out the money,and doing more\ncommercial services.Investment bank supposed to\nfocus on the capital markets,raising capital, trading,\nand asset management.But obviously, after 1999, the\nGlass-Steagall was repealed.There's no longer that.Some people blame\nthat, and probablyfor a very good reason, for the\ncause of 2008 financial crisis.But I want to tell you how\ncurrently investment banks areorganized.Vasily just mentioned he\nworks in the fixed income.So banks typically organized\nby institutional businessand asset management.So, within the institutional\nclient business,it has typically\nthree main parts.Fixed income, which\ntrade the debtand the

a very big force\nin the financial markets.So the question a\nlot of people askis, is this a zero sum game?I'm sure you've heard\nthis many times.So, in the financial\nmarkets, some people win,some people lose.A lot of times, it depends\non the specific products youtrade, the market you're in.It is, lot of times,\npretty net zero.But why do we need\nfinancial markets?This comes back to what\nI described before.Because something\nexisted-- actually,there's a need for it.It's really the need to\nbridge between the lendersand the borrowers.That's really coming down to\nthe essential relationship.So, investors who\nhave money needto have better yield or better\nreturn, better interest.In the current environment,\nwhen you have a savings account,you don't really\nearn much at all.And so you would have to take\nmore risk to generate morereturn, or you\nhave longer horizonCDs, other type of products,\nor trade the stocks.So, when somebody has money,\nwhen you trade stocks,you're essentially--\nyou're buying a stock,you give the money somewhere.Supposedly, it will\ngo to the company.Company use the money to\ngenerate a better return.And for the borrowers,\nwhoever needs money,they need to have\naccess to the capital.So obviously, different\nborrowers have different risks.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Some people borrow\nmoney, never return.So, never generate any\nreturns, or never evenreturn the principal.And so the trade between\nlenders and the borrowers,is again, essentially\nthe main driverof the financial markets.So, a few more words about\nthe market participants.So, banks and so-called dealers\nplay the role of market making.What is market making?So, when you or some end\nuser go to the market,wants to buy or sell,\ntypically, if there's no market,you don't really find the match.And some of the products\nyou want to buy or sellmay not necessarily be liquid.So, the dealers step in the\nmiddle, make you a price.Say, OK, you want\nto buy or sell.I can tell you-- this\nstock, I make you price.$0.99, and that's my bid.\n$0.95, that's my offer.So, that's the price I'm\nwilling to buy or sell.But what the result of\nthe trade-- the dealeractually takes the other\nside of your trade.So, they take principal\nrisk, in this case.So, that's the difference\nbetween dealersand the brokers.So, brokers don't really\ntake principal risks.If you want to buy\nsomething or sell something,if I'm a broker, I\ndon't make you a price.I go to the market makers.I actually put two\npeople together,matchmaking, make\nthat trade happen.So, I earn the commission.So, that's a broker's role.So obviously, there are\nindividual investors,retail investors, same meaning.Mutual funds, who actually\nmanage public

formto hopefully improve the\ncompany's profitability,and then catch up.And governments obviously have\na huge impact on the market.So, we know in the financial\ncrisis, government intervened.And not

hedges\nand the liabilities.When corporates borrow\nmoney, they create some risk,so they need to be sensitive\nto the market, it changes.So, to summarize the\ntypes of trading.The first type is\nreally just hedging.That means you're\nnot proactivelyadding risk to what you have.You already have some exposure.Just give you an example.Let's say you borrow\nmoney, you bought a house,so you have mortgage.So, let's say it's a floating\nrate mortgage payments.And you're worried about\ninterest rates going higher,so you can lock that rate in\ninto the fixed rate format.Or you can find

trade weaker.If you think it will be\nstronger, you just leave it.But if you think it\nwill trade weaker,so you may want to\nhedge it, meaningyou want to sell euro\nand buy US dollars.And so that's the hedging type.The second type, as I\nmentioned, is a market maker.So, market maker also\ntakes principal risk,but the main source of profit\nis really to earn the bid offer.I gave you the example\n$0.90 bid, $0.95 offer.So, that's what the market\nmaker is trying to profit from.But obviously, they\nhave residual riskssitting on the book.Not every trade is matched.So, how to

debt.So this example I'm\ngoing to give you is,let's think about\nAustralian corporate.Because interest\nrate in Australiais higher than in\nJapan, so typically,people like to borrow\nmoney in Japan, because youpay smaller interest.And they invest it in Australia.You earn higher interest rate.So let me ask you a question.Who can tell me,\nwhy don't peoplejust do that all day long,\njust borrow from Japanand invest it in Australia?Then that interest\nrate, I'm giving youexample of a difference is about\n3.5% for the roughly 10 yearswap rates.Yeah, go ahead.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].JAKE XIA:

same game, thenwhen you try to exit, you\nhave the adverse impactof your trade.So, let's say you think that's\nthe right time to do it,but then at one\ntime, you wake up,you said, huh, I think too\nmany people are doing this.I want to hedge myself.So, what do you do?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?JAKE XIA: Yep.So, you try to lock in, right?So basically, you sell\nthe Australian dollars,", "start":

you example.Even if you are\nnot a finance guy,you work in a corporate, you\njust do you import, export,or building a factory, you\nhave to know, actually,what the exposure is.So, risk management, nowadays,\nbecomes pretty widespreadresponsibility.It's not just the corporate\ntreasury's responsibility.So, that's on the hedging side.Obviously, if you are\nIntel, for example,you sell a lot of\nchips overseas.And your income--\nactually, Intel doeshave lot of overseas income\nsitting outside the States.So, the exposure to them is if\nthe exchange rate fluctuates,dollar becomes a lot stronger,\nthey actually lose money.So, they need to think about how\nto hedge the revenue producedoverseas.And obviously, for\nimport-exporters,that's even more apparent.And if you're entering\nin a merger deal,and one company\nis buying another,you need to hedge your\npotential currencyexposure and your\ninterest rate exposure.And whatever is on the\nassets, or the liability,or the balance

underlyingvalue of a particular\ninstrument,then trade on the\nrelative value.Obviously, there are successful\nvalue investors out there.And the systematic trader\nbuilds computer models.One example is trend following,\nso just follow the price trend.That used to be an effective\nstrategy for some time,but when lot of people\ndoing the same thing, thatbecomes much less effective.Or momentum, same thing.Stat arb, finding\nstatistical relationshipamong large number\nof stocks, thentrade at the higher frequency.And fundamental\nanalysis, you're reallytrying to understand what's\ngoing on in the world.What is the trade balance?What is the earning\npotential of a company?What's the trade\nbalance of a country?", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.106}, {"text": "What is a policy change?What does it mean\nwhen Federal Reserveannounce they're going to\ntaper the quantitative easing?Why the stock market is sold\noff in the last couple months,especially why stocks in\nIndia, Brazil, Indonesia,sold out more.Why is that?So it goes through those\nfundamental analysis.And there are\nspecial situations.Some companies are going\nthrough particular difficulties,assets are priced very cheaply.So, there are firms out there --\nyou probably heard Bain Capitaland many others -- where they\nfocus on these private equityand special situation\nopportunities.So what have all of these\nto do with mathematics?Where does math come in?How do you use math?So, I want to give you\nsome aspects of that.So from my personal experience,\nI joined the market,really start to working\non pricing models.So, that's the first area.So, math is very\neffective, because whenyou, your bank,\nyour corporate, youwant to buy some\nfinancial instruments,you have to know\nwhere is the price.It's easy to observe\na stock in the market,but when it comes to\nmore complex products,they just take one step\nforward on the complexity,which is the option.You have to know how\nto price an option.So, that's where\nthe math comes in.You actually have to be able\nto solve differential equationsto get a model price,\nthen you obviouslyadjust to your assumptions\nto fit into the market.So, pricing model, which Vasily\nand many of his colleaguescan tell you more--\nwhich is very much", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.13}, {"text": "a very interesting\nand challenging area.How do you price all\nthese instruments?And when I say pricing, it's\nnot in the narrow definitionof just coming up\nwith the price.When you build a\npricing model, you alsogenerate the risk parameters\nof these instruments,and how do you risk manage them.So, that comes to\nthe second part.So math is very useful\nin risk management,which I will give you\nsome -- not quiz --questions after this slide.You can see that risk management\nitself is very challenging.It's not a purely\nmathematical question,but yet, math plays\na very important roleto quantify how much\nexposure you have.Then, the third is\ntrading strategies.Again, I think a lot of\npeople with math background,or in general,\npeople are lookingfor the so-called holy\ngrail trading strategies.It's almost like perpetual\nmotion machines peoplelooking for 100 years ago.You just turn it on.It makes money by itself.You go to sleep, you go on\nvacation, you come back,you'll have more in\nyour bank account.Obviously, that's\nnot going to happen.The robotrader, a robotic\ntrader, is a dream.It has its place or its use,\nbut it's a fast evolving market.You have to constantly\neither upgrade your researchand adjust your strategies.There's no such thing you\ncan build and leave it alone,it runs for itself forever.But I just want to\nmention that because maybetowards the end of the\nterm you will feel, hmm,I came up with this\nbrilliant trading strategy.I think it's going to\nmake money forever.Please let me know first.AUDIENCE: And me second.PROFESSOR: So, I want to\nleave some time to Vasily.", "start": 2520.0,

hand\nit over to Vasily,let me ask you some questions.I just want to-- not really\nto quiz you, just give youthe sense how math and\nintuition and judgmentcan come into the same place.So, let me first give you an\nexample I call risk aversion.So, you are facing two choices,\nchoice A and a choice B. ChoiceA being you have 80\nchance to lose $500.You have 20% chance to win $500.That's pretty clear, right?That's choice A. Or\nchoice B, you basicallyjust lock in you have\n100% chance to lose $280.Let me ask you, for whoever\nlikes to choose choice A,please raise your hand.One, two, three, four.About six out of say,\nlet's call it 50.So, can I ask you why you\nthink choice A makes sense?AUDIENCE: So, I know it's\na lower expected value,but I enjoy gambling and I would\nrather take the chance of--JAKE XIA: Right, because you\ndon't want to lock in that $280loss, right?That, or you still\nhave 20% chance to win.For the ones raised\ntheir hand for choice A,are there any other reasons?Same reason.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]JAKE XIA: I assume\nthe rest of youwould choose choice B,\nunless you-- Neither?", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.117}, {"text": "How many of you choose choice B?Choice B. And are there\nanybody think neither is right?You have to choose.No, you have to choose.So, either choice A or choice B.So, let me just talk a\nlittle bit about this.Again, I'm not trying to\ntell you which one is right,but I just share my thoughts\nhow we look at these.Why it called risk aversion?So, this is very\ncommon human behavior.When you go to the\nmarket, you buy a stock.When the stock goes\nup, makes bit of money,the natural tendency -- for\nespecially someone is newto the market -- is\nto let's take profit.Let's sell.Oh, I made $1000.I made $500.Let's go have a nice\nmeal or whatever.Buy an iPad.But when the stock loses money,\nwhat's the natural tendency?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]JAKE XIA: That's--AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]JAKE XIA: I think natural\ntendency, lot of peoplewill keep it.I think if you have the\ndiscipline to get out,that's great.Trading is really all about\nhow do you risk manage,have the discipline, and\nhow to manage your losses.The natural tendency\nof a lot of peopleis, well, I think there's\na 20% chance to come back,and I'm going to make $500 more.Why do I want to lock in\nto stop myself out at 280?So even though the expected\nvalue-- I think lot of peoplesaid, you lose expected value,\nwhich is $300 in choice A,but you would still\nnot to choose choice B,because you don't want\nto lock in the $280 loss.Again, I'm not trying to inject\nthe idea to you of which oneis right or wrong,\nbut think about it.", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.152}, {"text": "So, that's really the common\nbehavior, which mathematicallymay not make sense, but lot of\npeople still would like to do.And also, really, when\nyou think about it,depends on your situation.And let's say, you\nthink the market--I'm giving you the\nstock example again.If you're not purely following\nthe discipline of stop loss,but you just think the\nfundamental picturehas changed.You really don't think the\nstock should go up anymore.Obviously, at whatever level\nyou should get out, regardlesshow much loss you lock in.But if you think the fundamental\nstory is still very sound,you should think about as if\nyou don't have a position, whatyou want to do next.But anyway,\nmathematically, I justwant to see-- I\nguess this is MIT,so many people\nthink mathematicallywhere you would actually\nchoose choice B, because that'slow expectation,\nwhich makes sense.But I think if you\nask a larger audience,I think a lot of people don't\nreally want to choose choice B,because they don't want\nto lock in the loss.Now, let me change the\nquestion a little bit.So, choice A becomes instead\nof the 80% chance to lose,now you have 80% chance\nto win $500 and 20% chanceto lose $500.Choice B, you have 100%\nchance to win $280.Who would choose choice A?Again, minority\nof

a\nbit more along in the class.I mean, the last\nday of the class,hopefully we'll have much\ndeeper discussion on this.It's not unique.The answer, I think it can go\nyou either way, as you said.If your bank account\nbalance is-- let'ssay you are a freshman student.Your bank account is $800.Your choice will be very\ndifferent from someone has$100,000 in his bank account.And also, your risk tolerance,\nhow much you can tolerate.I'm not going to give you\nsay, this is right or wrong.But with that, let me move on\nand give you some homework.So, before I give\nyou the homework,I want to make a\nfew more comments.Do people always learn\nfrom their experiences?In science, we collect\nevidence, we build models.We first understand the physics.We build mathematical models,\nthen we verify in physics,doing experiments.But is that the same\ninvestigation processin finance?Market cycles are\ntypically very long,but people tend to\nhave short memories.So, how do people really\nlearn from their experiences?A very interesting question.And very natural tendency\nis to extrapolate", "start": 3000.0, "heat": 0.771}, {"text": "historical experience.What happened in 2008?People still remember.What happened in 1970s?Maybe some people\nstill remember.What happened 100 years ago?So, people tend to extrapolate,\ndrawing conclusionsfrom very recent experience.And deterministic relationship\nversus statistical relationshipis very interesting, as well.When you try to trade on those,\nhow do you really build models?Is the market really efficient?What part is efficient?How do you really\napply those theoriesin your day-to-day risk\nmanagement or tradingactivities?And sometimes, people\ntend to oversimplify.Just say, oh, I can model this.This is one important parameter.I just take that.So I just give you\nall the warningsthat the-- again,\nvery young, new fieldand largely, often, this\nis art, than science.So keep that in mind,\neven though we're talkingabout mathematics in finance.Math is very powerful\nand useful in finance.So learn the math,\nlearn the finance first,but keep those\nquestions along the waywhen you are learning\nduring this class.So suggested homework, optional.I mentioned a lot of\nterminologies today.Go to the course website,\nread what we have put upfor the financial glossary.So if you still have things\nyou don't understand,compile your own list of\nfinancial concepts, whichyou can search on the\nweb or even ask us.But I encourage you to do that.It will prepare you well.So, that's really-- and\nread other

project is\n[INAUDIBLE] workedwas on estimating\nthe noisy derivative.Derivative is called delta.Delta is usually the first\nderivative to a function.And as we will see in the class,\nquite often, to obtain a price,you do it through Monte Carlo,\nmeaning running a lot of pathsand then averaging along them.So, it's a statistical method.So obviously, there is a noise\nto your answer every time.So, if you want to\ndifferentiate this functions", "start": 3240.0, "heat": 0.102}, {"text": "and get a derivative, then this\nderivative will be quite noisy.And so, instead of getting\nthe true derivative,you might obtain something quite\ndifferent from true derivativejust because there\nis a confidenceinterval around any point.And obviously, there is a\ntrade off here, as well,because you can run more paths,\nthrow more computational power,which will reduce your\nconfidence interval.You will know better where\nyou are, more precise.Or the other solution\ncould be, if youknow that your function is\nnot too concave and reasonablyflat, you might do the\nnumerical differentiationon wider interval.Basically, reducing the\nsignificance of the error,and you will hope to arrive\nto a better approximation.So obviously, there is somewhere\nbalance, and the question was,is there an optimal shift\nsize to get the derivative?And that's what-- uh oh,\nthe slide got corrupted.So, there was quite\na bit of mathematicsinvolved and minimization\nand optimization.There was an answer.And that's actually what\nwe finally arrived at.And that's some toy\nexample, but still, itshows you that if\nyou use constant sizeand not optimal size, that would\nbe your numerical derivativeof this blue function.While if you use\nan optimal shiftsize, which\n[INAUDIBLE] computed,it would be
