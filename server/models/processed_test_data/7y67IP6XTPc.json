class.You had Abhijit for\nthe first class.I am going to start by doing\na bit of housekeeping.Keeping in mind that maybe\nsome people are going toarrive, so it is your\nresponsibility to informeverybody else of what\nI said today.I got some requests of\nclarifying what was therequirements for this\nclass, so I'll justgo through it once.So we are going to post\nessay topics.For 10 topics.And we are going to give\nthree or four choices.You can also make\nyour own essays.Whatever it is.You do have a chance to\nwrite up to 10 essays.But you don't need to\nwrite that many.You are going to be graded\nout of the best five.So you can write any between\none and ten.And if you have one you're not\ngoing to have a very highgrade but--Any between five and ten and\nthen we'll just takethe best five, OK?I think the syllabus said seven\nand Abhijit said five,so I went for the\neasier thing.So that's one thing.The syllabus also said that we\nmight not grade all of thembut, actually, we are going\nto grade all of them.So I would suggest that you do\nthe first one so that you getused to it.Traditionally, it has been the\ncase that when students candecide how to arrange their\ndeadlines, they think that", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.236}, {"text": "it's efficient to set all thedeadlines late in the semester.I can tell you by experience\nthat it's actually exposed notto

class isto do the readings.And so to be prepared to\ndiscuss in the class.One way in which we're going\nto ensure that you're doingthe reading is a very,\nvery short pop-quizesevery once in awhile.It also means you have\nto come to class.It's not a class that's\nvery difficult.But one thing that it requires\nis that you actually come.And so we're going to have those\nat any random times.Very simple.2, 3, 4 questions just to check\nthat you've actuallyread the thing.And today the questions for the\nfirst topic were alreadyposted on Stellar.So you already have access to\nthem as well as the deadlinefor the first thing.And that's it.Other than that, I think I gave\na version of this spielin 14.74 yesterday.There are two development\nclasses.If you're wondering which one\nyou should be in, this one isgoing to be more based\non the readings anddiscussion and lectures.And the other one's going to go\nmore in the detail of thetechniques of papers and\nsolving the models andreplicating empirical\npapers, et cetera.So this one's a better\nintroduction and the other oneis better if you already have a\nfair amount of economics andeconometrics.So that's the trade off.", "start": 120.0,

bit boring.So you're welcome to shop a\nlittle bit for some time andthen decide what's\nmore appropriate.You're welcome to take both but\nI would have warned youthat there will be some overlap\nbetween the two.That's it for housekeeping so if\nyou have questions, that'sa good time.I'm happy to answer questions by\nemail also but chances arethat if you have a question on\nthe logistics, a lot of peopleshare it as well.Any questions?No.The class is being recorded,\nthat's for OpenCourseWare.But don't worry about saying\nanything embarrassing.That would be edited out.I'm the

maybe trapped in\nsome kind of poverty trap.So for example, there was this\nfarmer who, before he wasgiven fertilizer, had\nvery low yield.And because he had\nvery low yield hedidn't have much money.Because he didn't have much\nmoney, he couldn't buyfertilizer and, therefore,\nhe continued tohave very low yield.And what the Millennium Village\nProject did is to givehim the fertilizer.And the hope was, that with this\nfirst gift of fertilizer,his yield would increase by a\nsufficient amount that, downthe line, he would be able to\nbuy his own fertilizer.And grow more and more maize.And then, progressively, maybe\nstart feeding his childrenbetter and buying them books\nand all of those things youwant to think about.So in that video, the Sachs and\nJolie video that you sawlast time, this argument that\nthere might be these povertytraps keep coming over\nand over again.So for example, in the Kennedy\nstory with the farmers, yousee it in the schools.The schools don't have computers\nso the kids cannotreally learn well.You start putting computers\nand kids can learn better.They will then make\nmore money.They will then be able to buy\ncomputers for their schools,et

during\nthe entire class.We are going to have to be\nlooking for the same type ofconditions.So I want to start with\na story of someonethat actually I met.I met some guy called\nPak Solhin.Pak means mister.Mister Solhin.So people in Indonesia don't\nreally have a firstname and last name.They just have a name.And so, for example, Mrs.\nSo-and-so is Ebu--I would be Ebu Esther,\nfor example.So this guy is Pak Solhin.And I met him in a village\nin Indonesia--in Java, which is one of the\nrichest parts of Indonesia.This is the main island, most\ndensely populated--in the summer of 2008.In the summer of 2008, I was--probably for you it's already\nancient history, it's beforethe great collapse of the\nworld economy and stuff.--One of the key events at the\ntime, for the developingcountries in particular,\nwas that the foodprices were very high.Basically since 2005, food\nprices have increasedenormously in the world for\nreasons that are not fullyunderstood.And then they collapsed\nagain when the wholeeconomy went berserk.The world economy went away,\nthe food prices alsocollapsed, and they have started\nto increase again.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Part of the hunger that\nyou see now--in Egypt, Tunisia, et cetera,\nall over the Middle East--part of it is fueled by a\nre-increase in the food priceswhich are almost reaching\nthe 2008 level.For people in urban areas,\nthis has, of course,immediately threatened\ntheir livelihood.Because they don't\nproduce food.They buy food.So as soon as the food prices\nincrease, that immediatelyaffects them.So the beginning of 2008,\n2007 you observed thiskind of food riots--nothing like we are seeing\nnow in Egypt--but dis-content in various\nurban areas.And generally, people were\nwondering what was happeningto food prices.What people have been thinking\nis that there are severalfactors that are responsible\nfor theincrease of the food prices.One is there are many more\npeople in China and Indiamaking more money.And as they are making more\nmoney, not only they eat morebut, more that that,\nthey eat more meat.And it turns out that to produce\n1,000 calories ofmeat, you need much more\ngrain than to produce1,000 calories of grain.That may sound strange, but it\nturns out that the cow is nota very efficient way to\ntransform the calories fromgrain into calories\nthat we eat.The cow has started by using\na lot of it, et cetera.So to produce 1,000 calories\nof cows, you need much morethan 1,000 calories\nworth of grain.So as China and India is\nbecoming richer and eatingmore meat, then there is a\ndemand for more grains.That's one.The second thing that is\nhappening is bio-fuels.With the increase in the world\nprices of fuel there is moreand more demand for bio-fuels,\nso

these factors are\nfundamental forces whichexplains why, after the short\ndip right after the crisis,the food prices again\nstarted to increase.So that's the backdrop\nof my visit tothis village in Indonesia.And I met this guy.And he was all alone.He has a small, dingy,\nlittle house.And he was a bit depressed,\nor very depressed.And why was he depressed?Well he was depressed because\nhe was all

a\nconstruction site.And the two young kids were\nwith the grandparents.So he was all alone, he didn't\nhave anything in his house, hedidn't do all that much,\nand he wasn't happy.So the question is, why\ndid that happen?Why was he not working?And what he explained to me\nis that he was not workingbecause he didn't have a job.And he didn't have a job because\nwhen the fertilizerprices increased, the farmers\nthat used to employ him", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.183}, {"text": "decided that they had to do\nsomething to cut costs.They weren't very sure whether\nthey were going to be able tosell

could have cut\nwages or cut the number ofpeople employed.PROFESSOR: Right.They could have cut wages or\nthey could have cut the numberof people who worked for them.So of course, if they had\ncut wages, he stillwould have a job.But instead, they\ncut employment.And why did they cut employmentrather than cut wages?Well his theory was that if they\nhad cut wages, his wageswould've been so low that he\nwould not have been able tobuy enough food--especially as the food prices\nwere rising at the same time--with the equivalent of one day\nof wage that would have beentoo little to sustain himself\nto be strong enough toactually work for a whole day.So seeing that, the employer,\ninstead of cutting the wageand therefore making him unable\nto work, then you givea wage of someone, let's\nsay, 1,000 rupiahs--1,000 rupiahs is not enough to\nget yourself energetic for afull day of work.So you've spent your 1,000\nrupiahs but the person can'tfeed himself for\na day of work.You get nothing out of him,\nso there's no point.Yes?AUDIENCE: The question that came\nto my mind was, is thereany truth to his theory?Did you find any other examples\nthat would back upthat that's the reason why the\nfarmer, that he used to workon his land, decided to cut\njobs instead of wages?PROFESSOR: Right.What you're asking\nis whether--that's fine-- whether maybe\nit's a plausible theory.But is

truth\nof his theory, in termsof the biological soundness\nof it, itsounds plausible a priori.That you need to start with a\ncertain number of caloriesjust to get going, right?Your body needs maybe 1,000\ncalories just to survive.So the first thousand calories\nthat you're consuming are notvery useful to you to help you\nto actually start exercising.Then, once you are alive,\nthe next calorieswill start being useful.So a priori, maybe\nthere was someplausibility to this theory.That's only one theory.So that means that he\nlost his job so hecouldn't do much of anything.He was not doing nothing,\notherwise I wouldnot have met him.He would be dead.But he was doing things that\nwas not taking toomuch effort for him.For example, he was sitting next\nto the bank of a lake andhe was fishing.He was getting a little\nbit of rice fromthe government program.He was getting a little bit\nof meals from his brother.But he was not really\nliving a full life.He was sort of surviving.So at the heart of\nhis theory--and I think your question of\nwhether this is true or not isa very interesting question\nwhich certainly came to mymind when I was talking\nto him--but at the heart of

becoming\nworthless.There are other parts of his\nstories where we start seeingother bits of poverty trap.For example, what happened\nwith his kid.So the kid who had to drop out\nof school to start working asa construction worker was\nactually a bright kid.So that's another place\nwhere you see now aninter-generational\npoverty trap.Where because the parents are\npoor, the kid has to drop outof school because he has to go\nto work and therefore himselfwill probably make less\nmoney down the line.And that's another thing where\nwe have to ask exactly thesame question you were\nasking before.Is it an isolated example?Or is it something that\nis generalized.That it's actually something\nlike the inability to work forthe parents, or the lack of\nincome, that forces kids tostay out of

capacity curve has\nsomething like this shape.It relates how much effort you\ncan exercise to how muchincome you have, and, of course,\nhow much income youhave is supposed to be related\nto how much

what happened when the\nprice of food went up?What does it do to the\nwork capacity?Yeah?AUDIENCE: I suppose it goes down\nbecause those people haveto spend more of their\nincome on food andthen buy less food.PROFESSOR: Exactly.So what happens when the price\nof food goes up is that, interms of bushels of wheat,\nthat's the same thing.But in terms of actual income\nthat the bushel of wheattransform into-- how\nmuch income-- thatcreates a jump down.Because to go from income to\nwork capacity, to create fromincome today to calorie,\nthat's more expensive.So the curve shifts down

worms also\nshift your work capacity, yourattention capacity,\ndown because theyare eating your food.Therefore, that tends to make\nthe kids anemic and lesslikely to be listening.That's exactly right.Yeah?AUDIENCE: And so increase in\nfood prices, does that cause ashift or a stretch?PROFESSOR: It specifically\ncauses shift and a--how would you call it,\nwest-southwest, right?--It is both a

the\nsame thing because now thesame work capacity will\ntranslate into less income.So what was happening in\nIndonesia in 2008 was, on theone hand, food prices\nwere going up.On the other hand,

crop\nin the ground andthen you wait around.Then the crop comes and\nyou try to sell it.And you're exactly right, the\nfact that the input priceshave gone up while the demand,\nin principal, wouldnot have gone up.It would have meant that the\nfood prices sold by the farmerwould probably go up.But what happened is that they\nweren't very sure whether ornot the food prices were going\nto go up by the time they soldtheir food in proportion\nto the input prices.So the situation that prevailed\nin 2008 is a lot ofvolatility.The prices were high but they\nwere also increasing.And that was true for

the\nprices are going to go up forthat input in the future, in the\nmeantime, they still haveto buy the fertilizer.So they sort of had\nto cut costs now.So this is a little bit\nwhat was happening.It's a mismatch between the\nprice you have to pay for thefertilizer today.And you're going to realize\nthe output in the future.So that creates this uncertainty\nplus the fact thatyou need

degree.Because that's what opens\nthe door to you forvarious formal jobs.Right?It could easily cut one\nway or the other.I don't know if you guys\nhave an insight.For example, what\nis your view?Do you think that this is likely\nthat the first fewyears of education are\nnot so useful or--AUDIENCE: I think the first\nfew years are very usefulbecause some people\nlearn to develop,like, love for reading.And actually realize that they\ncan learn things by reading[INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: So for example, you\nthink that, the first fewyears of education\nare very useful.So there would be a relationship\nbetween incometoday and income\nof my children.But it wouldn't have this shape\nif that is the case.In fact, it might have a\ncompletely opposite shapewhere it's more like an inverted\nL as opposed to an S.So education would be one.What would be another\npossibility for this funnilylooking shape to appear between\nincome today andincome at some point\nin the future?Is it on my income in the future\nor the income of mychildren or my income\nnext year?What would be other sources\nof such shapes?Yeah?AUDIENCE: Access in knowledge\nof, like, the job market.In the sense that if you were\nraised in a family that's ahigher income and so, therefore,\nyour parents wouldteach you more from a younger\nage and would allow you tohave a higher income.PROFESSOR: Right.So for example, for access\nto the job market, it is", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.158}, {"text": "possible-- if I can rephrase\nwhat you are saying-- thatpeople who live in a village,\ntheir horizon is the village.Where

available.So in that case, for people who\nhave very little money andlive in the village, well, their\nchildren will again alsolive in the village and have\nvery little money.If suddenly something opens the\npossibility to go to thecity-- for example, someone\ncomes into some money, getsthe option to buy a train\nticket, goes to the city andfigures out the options there.Then suddenly you have

because\nI save more.But if it's a fixed fraction of\nmy income, what else do Ineed for this S-shape to come?Yes?AUDIENCE: You need for poor\npeople to not be able to savethis fraction.Because they, for instance,\nspend their money on food orthings that they need\nto buy today.And so are either a fraction\nof [INAUDIBLE]income or it's just lower\nfor poor people.PROFESSOR: Right.So the first possibility for\nan S-shape to appear due tosavings is that actually people\ndo not save a fixedfraction of their income.Is that for some reason, the\npoor save less than the rich.So if that's the case-- and\nlet's talk through whether wehave reasons to think that\nthe poor would saveless than the rich--but let's first take it as given\nfor a moment, and let'sassume the poor save\nless than the rich.And if that's the case--assume the poor save nothing--then if you're very poor, you\nhave no income tomorrow comingout of investments.And then if you start saving\nwhen you become a littlericher

rich?And that is something that, I\nthink, we all have in mind.Say, yes, of course, the\npoor don't save becausethey have no money.But one thing I want you to keep\nin mind is that the poorhave no money but they\nhave a presentand they have a future.So unless they think that they\nwill have more money tomorrowor unless, for some reason, they\nare extremely impatient,then the poor should want\nto save as well.", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.137}, {"text": "Because, of course, today\nthey have verylittle money for food.But tomorrow they'll have very\nlittle for food as well.So we need to go a little\nfurther than to say, well, ofcourse the poor save because\nthey have no money.Right?Again, let's not go into\nthe details of that.I think there are good reasons\nto think that the poor wouldbe less able to save\nthan the rich.And we're going to have\na whole set oflectures about that.But just keep in mind that it's\nnot so obvious that thepoor would be less\nlikely to

health.Another reason why there might\nbe a relationship betweenincome today and income\ntomorrow ofthis form due to savings.Suppose that the poor and the\nrich saved both a proportionof their income.There could still be a\nrelationship like that.Yeah?AUDIENCE: The rich could be able\nto invest their savingsmore effectively.PROFESSOR: Exactly.It could be that the rich have\naccess to better investmentopportunity.For example, it could be that\nthe bank is just notinterested in very small\nsaving accounts.And in fact, it's the case\nthat the banks are notinterested in very small\nsaving accounts.Because as soon as you're a bank\nand you take the savingof someone, the government is on\nyour back to make sure thatyou don't run away\nwith the saving--which is a good idea--\nbut that costs money.So maintaining a saving account\nfor someone costs someamount of money.And regardless of the size of\nthe account, it still coststhe same money because you need\nto do all the paperwork.So as a result, if you come to a\nbank with your five rupiahs,the bank is going to say, thank\nyou, but I don't wantyour five rupiahs.Whereas, if you come with your\n5,000 rupiahs they're, sure,I'm going to put it in this very\nnice account for you witha nice return.So that's one reason\nright there.That the poor might have to save\nunder the mattress where", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.18}, {"text": "the money might disappear.Where it might be stolen.And so the return on\nsaving for the poormight be very low.It might even be negative.Whereas, the return for the rich\nmight be higher, eitherbecause they have access to this\nsavings account or theycan, for example, start\na small business.For example, when you want to\nstart a small business, is itworthwhile starting a tiny\nbusiness with almost nothing?Maybe not.Maybe it needs to be large\nenough for it to beworthwhile.So even if the poor and the\nrich were to save the sameamount proportionally, there\nmight still be somethingrelated, not to how much they\nsave, but what's theproductivity of those savings.You were talking about\nhealth care.Why don't you tell us what\nyou're thinking abouthealthcare.AUDIENCE: So at lower incomes\nyou can't reallybuy a lot of medicine.And maybe you can reach a point\nwhere you can startbuying medicines or\nbuying healthcare.And maybe towards the end when\nyou have higher income, itlevels off because you don't\nencounter the health problemsthat you might at low incomes\nin the first place.PROFESSOR: Right.So healthcare might be another\nsource of that.For example, if you're very\npoor, you might not be able topurchase very simple, relatively\ncheap technologiesthat prevent you from\ngetting sick.It could be a covering\nfor your water.It could be a water filter.It could be a bed net to put on\ntop of your kids when theysleep so that they don't\nget malaria.So all of these things might\nall be like some fixedinvestment that, if you\ncan't afford them, youcan't afford them.And then you are getting sick\nmore, therefore you are lessproductive, therefore you make\nless money, et cetera.So that's another source where\nwe would have this S-shape.", "start":

sick all the time.Or paying for the doctors,\nfor example.So for example, if someone is\nsick and very poor they mightnot be able to pay\nfor the doctor.Then they'll stay sick so\nthey can't earn money.And again, a doctor visit is one\nbig lump investment whichyou may or may not be\nable to afford.That would be another source\nof an S-shape like that.So the reason why I went through\nall of

another shape?That's what we have to\nassert empirically.And it's going to have\nto be gathered on acase-by-case example.So for example, for food.To create this shape, to know\nwhat is the form of the shape,we are going to need\nto know two things.We need to know what is the\nrelationship between how muchincome you have and how many\ncalories you consume.And what is the relationship\nbetween the calories youconsume and your\nwork capacity?And the product of the two\nwill be that curve.And the shape it has--God knows, I mean, actually even\nwe know, but we're goingto cover that next time.So

me-- and the nextyears of education are\nnot so valuable.What is really important is\nto learn how to read.Imagine that's the case.Then it means that the\nrelationship between incometoday and income tomorrow\nis not as steep anymore.It starts very high and\nthen it tapers off.And so we can play the same\ngame again that we wereplaying before.We can say, well, let's draw\nthe diagonal line.Let's start with some\nincome, a1.To find out income tomorrow\nwhat do we do?We go vertical.We find income, a2.Then we have to go horizontal to\nthe 45-degree line to findit on the horizontal line.We go

it\nclear, is going back to ourKenyan farmer from the MTV\nvideo, Kennedy fertilizer.If you put fertilizer\non your crop--well when you put just\na little bit, theeffects are very high.But when you

first place.So that's not really\nhelpful anymore.So in that case, the returns\ndon't have this S-shape.They have this inverted\nL-shape.So in that case, there\nis no poverty trap.And so that is where the\nquestion that you were askingis essential.Which is, how do we know what\nthe shape of this curve?Because the shape of this curve\nis going to cruciallydetermine whether or\nnot we have a trap.And

accelerating.And this zone must to be at a\nplace where the income wasrelatively low to start with.And it needs to accelerate\nenough that it's becoming highto start with.In other words, it needs to
