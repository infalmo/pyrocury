already\nstarted on education.And this is sort of the last\nof the education lectures.So what I propose to do today is\nto just kind of try to tella story, a single story\nthat kind of fits someof the facts together.You've seen some of the broad\npatterns of dysfunctionalityalready, as well as some\nof the local successstories, if you like.I think the last lecture was\nabout this NGO [INAUDIBLE]and its many efforts to\nimprove education.So what I'm going to do today\nis continue from there, buttalk a little bit more\nsort of big picture,focusing mostly on--the goal is to tie things\ntogether into a story thatmight make some sense, and help\nus think forward about,if this is what's going on,\nwhere should we act?That's always the ultimate\nquestion we have in mind,which is to try to find a way to\nan action point or a lever.And it's only by wrapping in\nthese facts into a narrative", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.267}, {"text": "that we can find a lever.So what I want to do is\nI want to go fromthe fact to a lever.And the way we will go there is\nby talking about a specificinterpretation of the facts.So that's what I want to do.And I'm hoping that you already\nread some of thismaterial and are sufficiently\nengaged with it, that we'llhave a lot of discussion along\nthe way about, is this areasonable interpretation\nof the facts or not?And I'm very much open to the\nidea that you may think thatthis is not the right\ninterpretation.And we can definitely, you\nshould feel free to proposealternatives or whatever\nyou think.You think I'm going too fast,\nor trying to push the logictoo far, you should stop me,\nor if you have questions.So I think that the first fact,\nwhich is I think very,very widely accepted but somehow\nnot necessarily verywidely documented, is that\neducation is actuallybeneficial for the people\nwho get it.And you would that this is\nsomething that we would haveseen tons and tons of reliable\nevidence on.But in fact, the reliable\nevidence, even on this verybasic question, is\nrelatively weak.The reason why education\nevidence tends to be weak isthat, as you know, education's\nnot like taking a medicine.The nice thing about\ntaking medicine isthat I take a medicine.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "A week later, I'm better.Education is something that\nhas action at a distance.It's like something that I get\neducated today and tomorrowand day after, the\nday after that.And then distant future, I get\na job, and that's where itbenefits me.So that sort remoteness of it is\nactually part of the reasonwhy it's hard to find good\nevidence for education.You need to have a data set\nwhere you saw who got educatedtoday, and what happened\nto theirsalaries' 20 years later.And that's not always easy to\nfind, for obvious reasons.You might imagine that\nyou do need to trackpeople in some way.So that's why there's\nnot much evidence.The evidence that there is, a\nsignificant part of it comesfrom countries like\nthe US, where theevidence is very clear.Education seems to have a clear\nand relatively high,stable rate of return.Hasn't changed very\nmuch over time.And a few studies like the one\nfrom Indonesia which also findthe same thing, and actually\nfind, surprisingly, relativelysimilar rates of return\non education.The benefits of education in\nIndonesia seem to be similarto that in the US.And that's something that, when\nit came out, was rathersurprising to people.Why would it be surprising?What would you have expected?AUDIENCE: I don't know, that\neducation here might be betteror something.PROFESSOR: Right.So you could imagine\nthat it would be--education in the US has higher\nquality, so maybe the returnswould be higher in the US.Anybody want to suggest a\nreason for the opposite?AUDIENCE: Education in the\nUS is more expensive.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "PROFESSOR: That's an\nexcellent point.But primary education is what\nwe're talking about right now.So that's not very\nexpensive, right?It's mostly free.AUDIENCE: If everyone in the\nUS has an education,[INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Absolutely.The opposite view is\nthat educationis scarce in Indonesia.And especially in the early\n'70s, very few people hadprimary education.So you might imagine that\nsomething that's scarcetypically has a higher price.So you might imagine that it\nwould be more rewarding.So you could imagine it\ngoing either way.Turns out, these two effects\nseem to have cancelled out.And you get on net, roughly the\nsame rate on education inthe US as you get\nin Indonesia.But that's all to say that we\nseem to think that there is--it's not that there's a huge\namount of evidence.But what there is seems pretty\nconsistent and compelling.So I think most people accept\nthe idea that there is abenefit from education.And then the next question that\nthen arises is if there'sa benefit from education,\nwhy are peoplegetting such lousy quality?Why isn't it the case that\neducation systems kind ofstand up and deliver?If education's valuable, why\nisn't there a system thatsupplies it?Why is it that you have all\nthese schools where kids are", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "going and learning nothing?AUDIENCE:

wages that thatchild could be earning.The other thing that, unlike\nother investments, is thereturns, like we talked about\nearlier, are very long-term.PROFESSOR: So you're saying that\none reason why educationmight be different is the\nconnection between the costyou're paying and the returns\nyou're getting is weak.So maybe the government,\nI don't reallythink about the returns.The government wants me to send\nmy children to school.So I send them.But I don't really\nthink about it.So I don't think of\nall the returns.I don't make the investments\nin it.I don't really care about it.It's just something the\ngovernment wants me to do.And therefore, I don't\nget benefits.So I'm going to try to suggest\nevidence that that's notwhat's going on.But that's exactly right.One very plausible

which part\nof education is valuable.And that's sort of what\nyou're suggesting.AUDIENCE: Question.So we just talked about how,\nin Indonesia, we saw therewere benefits to education.And now we're talking about theeducation being poor quality.So is the idea that even this\npoor quality education isstill incurring benefits that\npeople aren't realizing, that[INAUDIBLE]?PROFESSOR: So I think that goes\nback to the conversationwe had a little while ago, which\nis that we would imaginethat in Indonesia, education\nwould be a lot more valuablethan in the US.Because there's so\nmuch less of it.And you would think that when\nI'm the first primary educatedperson in the village, that's\nmuch more valuable than beingthe 2,000th.Never the less, we don't find\nhigh returns in Indonesia.We find comparable to the US.So the idea is, implicitly, that\nthe returns to educationare lower in Indonesia partly\nbecause the quality is--actually somebody suggested\nexactly that, which is thatone reason why you might\nexpect lower returns inIndonesia is that the\nquality is lower.And so I think the concern iseducation is socially valuable.We want it because there's\nnot many educated people.On the other hand, maybe the\ndelivery systems are weak.And therefore, it's not\nworth getting it.So that's a trade off.And the question, if you look at\nthe other evidence, you'vealready looked at it, it

question.And a corollary to that question\ncomes from the factthat, in fact, the Pratham\nexperience suggests, is it'snot even that hard to\nimprove quality.It may well be that you could\nimagine that it's justimpossible to improve quality,\nbecause kids are verydifficult to teach.But in fact, kids are not\ndifficult to teach.The whole Pratham experience is\nthat whenever you have anintervention which sort of\nprovides them with some littlebit of extra help and some\nfocused help on what theyneed, the kids improve fast.So that makes it even\nmore positing.Because at some level, it's\neasy to

another\npossibility.Now, part of the reason we\nemphasize some of the Prathamexperience was that large\nis a relative word.But Pratham operates\non a fairly--like a state in India is often\nlarger than any five countriesyou would randomly name\nin the world.So it's not small in any\nobvious scale of small.That's why we were\nemphasizing it.So if you take five countries\nat random, the sum of thestates, the way they work, would\nbe smaller than this.Because India has\nso many people.OK.So this is sort of the story\nthat several of you havealready hinted at, which is a\nstory that parents

flatten out.So the returns go kind of like\nthat, then like that,and then like that.That's an s.Is that clear, why it's an s?So that idea.One of the hypothesis that\nI think we've been mostpersuaded

average of verylows and very highs.So in some sense, the average\nlooks actually less wrong thanthe individual parents think.So some parents are\noverestimating their returns.They're all sending

children.Why discriminate?One year of education is\none year of education.So there's no reason\nto discriminate.Now, imagine we believed\nsomething else.We believe that the\nfirst years ofeducation
