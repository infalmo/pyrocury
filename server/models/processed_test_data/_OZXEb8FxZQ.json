[{"text": "PROFESSOR: All right.Good morning.And welcome to 8.06.Let's begin.Our subject in 8.06 has to do\nwith applications of quantummechanics and using\nquantum mechanicsto understand complex\nsystems, in fact systemsmore complex than the ones\nyou've understood before.For example, in\nprevious courses,you've understood very well\nthe simple harmonic oscillator.You've solved for\nthe Hamiltonian.You've found all\nthe eigenstates.You've found all the energies.You know about the spectrum.You can do time evolution\nin the harmonic oscillator.You've discussed\neven peculiar stateslike coherence states,\nsqueeze states.You know a lot about this\nvery simple Hamiltonian.You've also studied the\nhydrogen atom Hamiltonian.And you've found the\nspectrum of the hydrogen atomwith all the\ndegeneracies that ithas and understood\nsome of those wavefunctions and the properties.And those are exact systems.But it turns out\nthat in practice,while those exact systems form\nthe foundation of what youlearn, many systems,\nand most of the systemsyou face in real life and\nin research, are systemsthat are more complicated.But at least a large fraction\nof them have a saving grace.They can be thought as\nthat simple Hamiltonianthat you understand very\nwell plus an extra termor an extra effect, some sort\nof your total Hamiltonianbeing essentially the\nsimple Hamiltonian", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.102}, {"text": "but differs from it\nby some amount thatmakes it a little different.So your simple\nHamiltonian thereforecan be the harmonic oscillator.And in that case, for\nexample, in general,you may have a potential\nfor a particle.And you know, near the\nminimum of the potential,the potential is roughly\nquadratic in general.But then, as a Taylor\nexpansion around the minimum,you find a quadratic\nterm, no linear term,because it's a minimum,\na quadratic term.And then you will find maybe\na cubic or a quartic term.And the oscillations\nare a little unharmonic.But it's dominated by the\nsimple harmonic oscillatorbut some unharmonicity.This is studied by people that\nlook at diatomic molecules.The vibrations have this effect.It's experimentally detectable.You can have the hydrogen atom.And if you want to\nstudy the hydrogen atom,how does an experimentalist\nlook at the hydrogen atom?He puts the hydrogen atom\nand inserts a magnetic fieldand sees what happens to the\nenergy levels and then insertsan electric field and sees what\nhappens to the energy levels.And those can be thought\nas slight variationsof the original Hamiltonian.Van der Waals forces are,\nyou have two neutral atoms,and they induce on each\nother dipole momentsand generate the force,\na very tiny effecton otherwise simple\nhydrogen atomstructure but a very important\nforce, the Van der Waals force.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So what we're going\nto be doing istrying to understand these\nsituations in which we havea Hamiltonian that is equal to\na well known Hamiltonian, this H0.0 meaning no perturbation,\nno variation.This is our well known system.But then there's going\nto be an extra pieceto that Hamiltonian.And we're going to call\nit delta H. Delta H is yetanother Hamiltonian.It may be complicated,\nmay be simple.But it's different from H 0.Now, this will be the\nHamiltonian of the systemthat you're really\ntrying to describe.And therefore, you\nshould demand, of course,that H 0, delta H, and\nH are all Hermitian.All Hamiltonians are\nsupposed to be Hermitian.And this is the situation we\nwant to understand in general.This is the concrete\nmathematical descriptionof the problem.But we do a little more here.We need a tool to help\nus deal with this.And there's a wonderful nice\ntool provided by a parameter.A parameter here makes\nall the difference.What is this parameter?It's a parameter we\nlike to put here.And we'll call it lambda.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "You might have said, no.I don't have such a thing.This is what I want to do.But still, it's better\nto put a lambda there,where lambda is unit-free,\nno units, and belongsto the interval 0 to 1.In that way, you\nwill have defineda family of Hamiltonians\nthat depend on lambda.And lambda is this quantity\nthat you can vary from 0 to 1.So you decide you're going to\nsolve a more general problem.Perhaps you knew what is the\nextra term in the Hamiltonian.And you say, why do\nI bother with lambda.The reason you\nbother with lambdais that it's going to help us\nsolve the equations clearly.And second, physically,\nit's kind of interesting,because you could think of\nlambda as an extra parameterof the physics in which you\nmaybe set it equal to 0,and you recover the\noriginal Hamiltonian.Or you vary it, and\nwhen it reaches 1,it is the Hamiltonian\nyou're trying to solve.On the other hand,\nthis parameterallows you to do\nsomething very nice too.One of the things\nwe're going to tryto clarify by the\nend of this lectureis, shouldn't this\nthing be rather smallcompared to this one.If we want to, say, deform\nthe system slightly,we won the correction\nbe small comparedto the original Hamiltonian.So what does it mean\nfor a Hamiltonianto be small compared\nto another Hamiltonian?These are operators.So what does it mean?Small.You could say,\nwell, I don't know", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "precisely what it means small.Maybe means that the matrix\nelements of this delta Hare small compared to the\nmatrix elements of that.And that is true.Surprisingly, will\nnot be enough.On the other hand,\nwhatever is small--we could all agree that\nif this is not small,we could put lambda equals 0.01.Maybe that's small.But if that's not small,\nlambda equal 10 to the minus 9.If that's not small,\n10 to the minus 30.At some point, this\nwill be small enough.And therefore, we could\ntry to make sense.This allows you to really think\nof this as a perturbation.For whatever delta H is, for\na sufficiently small lambda,this is small.So this is what we're\ngoing to try to solve.And let's try to imagine\nfirst what can happen.So I'm going to try to\nimagine what's going on.A plot, that's the best\nway to imagine things.So I'll do a plot.Here I put lambda.And here, in the\nvertical axis, Iwill indicate the\nspectrum of H 0.So this is going\nto be an energy.So it may happen\nthat, in our systems,there's a ground state.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And this ground state is\ngoing to be a single state.I will not put a name to it.I will just say there\nis one state here.That means the ground\nstate is non-degenerate.Degenerate states are\nstates of the same energy.And I say there's just one\nstate, so not degeneracy.Suppose you go here.And now you find two states.So I put two dots here\nto indicate that thereare two states there.Finally, let's go\nhigher up and assumethat this Hamiltonian\nmaybe has one state here,but here it has four states.And these are the energies.Those are some numbers.And the spectrum must\ncontinue to exist.So this is a spectrum of your\nH 0, the Hamiltonian you know.Certainly, the hydrogen\natom Hamiltonianhas degenerate states.So that's roughly\nwhat's happening there.The simple harmonic\noscillator in one dimensiondoesn't have degenerate states.But the isotopic\nharmonic oscillatorin two or three dimensions\ndoes have lots of degeneracies.You've seen those, probably.So that's typical.So what are we\naiming to understand?We're aiming to\nunderstand what happensto the energy of\nthose states or whathappens to the\nenergy eigenstatesas the perturbation\nis turned on.So imagining lambda going\nfrom 0 to 1, the processof turning on the perturbation.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And eigenstates are\ngoing to change,because whatever was\nan eigenstate of H 0is not going to be an eigenstate\nof the new Hamiltonian.And the energies\nare going to change.So everything is\ngoing to change.But presumably, it will\nhappen continuouslyas you change lambda\ncontinuously from 0 to 1.So this first state, for\nexample, may do this.I don't know what it will do.But it will vary as\na function of lambda.The energy will do something.Maybe we can cut it here and say\nthat lambda is equal to 1 here.Now we have two states.So I can analyze this\nstate with what'scalled non-degenerate\nperturbation theory, whichmeans you have a\nnon-degenerate state.And there are\ntechniques that we'regoing to do today to understand\nhow this state varies.But how about this one?Here you have two states.What happens to them?Well, two states should\nremain two states.And their energies,\nwhat will they do?Maybe they'll track each other.But maybe the perturbation\nsplits the degeneracy.That's a very\nimportant phenomenon.Let's assume it does that.So it may look like this,\nlike that, for example.The perturbation makes\none state have more energythan the other.Here is another state.Now, a phenomenon\nthat might happen--many things can happen.This is a very rich subject\nbecause of all the thingsthat can happen.It may happen that this thing,\nfor example, goes like this", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and like that.But there are four states.It may be that one\nstate goes here.And three states go here.But then after a little\nwhile, they'll depart.How many did I want?No, I got too many.Well, five.All right, so it may\nhappen, something like that,that they split, and\nthen to a higher order,they kept splitting.In fact, they're splitting here\nalready, but you don't see it.It's too close, just the\nsame way as x squared and xto the fourth and x to\nthe eighth, at the origin,they all look the same.And then they eventually split.So this is what we're\ngoing to try to understand.For this, we need non-degenerate\nperturbation theory,for this, degenerate\nperturbation theory, for this,we need sophisticated\ndegenerate perturbation theory.This is a very\nintricate phenomenon.But still, it happens and\nhappens in many applications.So we're going to\nstart with a simplerone, which is non-degenerate\nperturbation theory.And then we say, well, what does\nit mean that we understand H 0?It means that we have found\nall the eigenstates with k 1,maybe up to infinity.I don't know.k is not momentum.These are the energy\neigenstates of H 0that we're supposed to know.And they're all orthonormal.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "That can always be done.When you have a\nHermitian Hamiltonian,you can find an orthonormal\nbasis of states.And being orthonormal,\nthis orthogonality holds.The states are\neigenstates of the H 0.So for this, we'll\ncall this E k 0.The energy of this\nstate, k, for the labelof the state, 0,\nbecause we're not doinganything in perturbation yet.We're dealing with the\nunperturbed 0th order system.That defines the energies.And this energy\nsatisfies a E 0 0is less than or equal than E 1\n0 less than or equal to E 2 0.So all the energies are ordered.I need the equals because\nof the degeneracy.They might be degenerate.So you have this situation.So let's consider this state\nthat is non-degenerate.And let's assume this\nis the state n 0.It's the nth state.If n 0 is\nnon-degenerate, it meansthat E n 0 it's really\nsmaller than the next one.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And it's really bigger, the\nenergy, than the previous one.No equal signs there.It really means those\nthings are separate.And that's the meaning\nof non-degeneracy.And now, what are\nwe trying to solve?Starting from this\nn 0, we're tryingto find out how\nthe energy changesand how the state changes.Both things are important.So we're going to try to solve.Therefore, for H\nof lambda n lambda.The state n 0 is going to\nchange when lambda turns on.And it's going to\nbecome n of lambda.And this is going to\nhave an energy E nlambda instead of E n 0.This has an energy\nE n 0 with respectto the original Hamiltonian.Now it's going to have an energy\nE n of lambda n of lambda.So that's the equation\nwe want to solve.This is what this state n 0\nbecomes as you turn on lambda.And this is what\nthe energy E n 0becomes as you turn on lambda.So we note that, when\nn lambda equal to 0,", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.11}, {"text": "is what we call\nthe state n zero.And the energy E n at lambda\nequal 0 is what we call E n 0.So with this initial\nconditions at lambda equals 0,we're trying to\nsolve this systemto see what the state becomes.And now, here comes\na key assumption,that the way we're\ngoing to solve thisallows us to write a\nperturbative serious expansionfor this object.So in particular, we'll write\nn of lambda is equal to n 0.That's what n of lambda should\nbe when lambda is equal to 0.So then there will be a first\norder correction, lambda,times the state n 1 plus lambda\nsquared times the state n 2.And it will go on and on.Moreover, E n lambda,\nwhen lambda is equal to 0,you're back to the energy E n 0.But then there will be a\nlambda correction times E n 1--that's a name for the\nfirst order correction--plus a lambda squared\ncorrection E n 2.So this is our\nhypothesis that thereis a solution in a perturbative\nserious expansion of this kind.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.187}, {"text": "And what are our unknowns?Our unknowns are this object.This one we know is\nthe original state.This object is unknown.This is unknown.This is unknown.All these things are unknown.And they go on like that.Most important, all these\nobjects don't depend on lambda.The lambda-dependence is\nhere, lambda, lambda squared,lambda on.And these are things that\ndon't depend on lambda.These are objects that\nhave to be calculated.They're all lambda-independent.So we are supposed to solve this\nequation under this conditions.And that's what we're\ngoing to do next.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.196}]
