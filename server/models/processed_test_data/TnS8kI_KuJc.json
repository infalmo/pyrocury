bookie.And what a bookie does--\nhe sets bets on the horses,sets the odds, and\nthen pays money back.Probably collects a fee\nsomewhere in between.So suppose he is a\ngood bookie and heknows quite well the horses,\nand there are two horses.He knows that for sure one\nhorse has 20% chance of winningand another horse has\n80% chance of winning.Obviously, the\ngeneral public doesn'thave all of this information.So they place a bet\nslightly differently.And then there is $10,000\nbet on one horse and $50,000bet on another horse.Well, bookie is sure that he\npossesses good information.So he-- suppose he\nsets the odds accordingto real-life probability.So he sets it four to one.What would be possible\noutcomes of the race for him?Monetary.So suppose the first horse wins.Then what happens?He has to pay back $10,000\nand four times more.So he pays out $50,000.And he receives $60,000, right?So he can keep\n$10,000 out of it.OK.So what happens is the other\nmore probable horse wins.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.199}, {"text": "Well, he'll have to pay back the\n$50,000 and one quarter of it,which is $12.25.So at the end, he'll\npay 62 1/2 thousand,while he collected\n$60,000, out right?So he will-- in this\nsituation, he will lose $2,500.Well, all in all, he\nexpects to make nothing.So he probably could\ncollect enough feesto cover his potential loss.But there is certainly a\nvariability in outcomes.He can win a lot.He can lose some.Now, what if he forgets\nabout his knowledgeabout the real-life\nprobabilities of horses winningor losing and instead sets bets\naccording to the amount whichwe are already bet.According to the\nmarket, effectively.So what if he sets\nthe odds five to one,according to the bets placed?Well, in this situation,\nif the first horse wins,he pays back 10 plus\n5 times 10, so 60.He is 0.And if the second horse wins,\nhe pays back 50 plus 1/5 of 50,plus another 10.Again 60.So no matter which horse\nwins, he will get 0.We're 100% sure.And if he collects\nsome fee on top of it,he will make a riskless profit.And that's how, actually,\nbookies are operating.So it's a simple example.But it gives us a first idea\nof how a risk-neutral frameworkand risk-neutral pricing works.So we are, here,\nnot in the businessof making bets on horses.We are actually in the business\nof pricing derivatives.So we will talk about the\nsimplest possible derivatives--", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.513}, {"text": "mostly derivatives on stocks.But there are more\ncomplicated derivatives,underlying for which could be\ninterest rates, bonds, swaps,commodities, whatever.So a derivative\ncontract is some--in general speaking, a\nformal pay-out connectedto underlying.Usually, the underlying\nis a liquid instrumentwhich is traded on exchanges.And derivative may be\ntraded on exchanges.Actually, quite a\nfew equity optionsare traded on exchanges.But in general, they are\nover-the-counter contractswhere two counterparties just\nagree on some kind of pay-out.One of the simpler derivatives\nis a forward contract.So what is a forward contract?A forward contract is a\ncontract where one party agreesto buy an asset from another\nparty for a price whichis agreed today.Usually, this forward\nprice is set in such a waythat right now, no\nmoney changes hands.Right?And here is an example.Well, suppose there\nis a stock which,right now, is priced at $80.And this is the\nforward for two years.So somebody agrees\nto buy the stockin two years for this price.And not surprisingly, I\nsomehow set this price suchthat currently the value\nof the contract is 0.And we'll see how I'll\ncome up with the price.So this blue line is\nactually the pay-out,what will happen at the end.Right?The pay-out,\ndepending-- the graphof F at time T, the\ndetermination time or expiry--", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.537}, {"text": "how it depends on\nthe stock price.Right?So obviously, the\npay-out is S minus K,where S is the stock price,\nso it's a linear function.It turns out that the counter\nprice is also a linear functionbut slightly shifted.And we'll see how come\nit's slightly shiftedand how much it\nshould be shifted.And K is usually referred\nto as a strike price.Another slightly more\ncomplicated contractis called a call option.So if previously the\nforward is an obligationto buy the asset\nfor an agreed price,call option is\nactually an optionto buy an asset at the\nagreed price today.You can view it--\na call option canbe viewed as kind of\ninsurance that the--against the asset going down.Basically the pay-out\nis always positive.You can never lose money.On the forward,\nyou can lose money.You agree on the price.The asset ends up being\nlower than this price,but you still have to buy it.Right?Here, if the asset ends up\nat expiry below strike priceor out of the money, then\nthe pay-out will be 0.If, on the other hand, it ends\nup being above the strike priceor, it's called, the\noption is in the money.Then the pay-out will\nbe S minus K as before.So in mathematical\nterms, the pay-outis maximum of S minus K and 0.Right?And that's what happens at\nexpiry time-- this blue line.So what is the price\nof this option now?Well, obviously it\nshould be slightly abovebecause even if now\nthe asset is slightly", "start": 360.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "out of the money--\nbelow strike price--there is some volatility to\nit, and there is a probabilitythat we will still end up\nin the money at expiry.So you would be\nwilling-- you shouldbe willing to pay\nsomething for this.Obviously, if it's way out\nof the money, it should be 0.Right?On the other hand, if it's\nway in the money, in fact,it should be just as forward.And in fact, it is.We'll see because\nthe probabilityfor the asset going back to\nthe strike price and belowwill be low.And the Black-Scholes equation\nand Black-Scholes formulais exactly the solution\nfor this curved line,which we'll see in a second.Another simple contract, which\nis kind of dual to call option,is a put option.So put option, on\nthe contrary, isa bet on the asset going\ndown, rather than up.Right?So the pay-out is maximum\nof K minus S and 0.So it's kind of reversed.Also a ramp function,\nat maturity.And here is the current price.Again, even if\nit's in the money--if it's way in the money,\nwe expect it to be 0.If it's way in the\nmoney, we expectit to be slightly below forward,\njust because of this counting.OK.So and here are a few--\nthree main points,which we'll try to\nfollow, through the class.So first of all,\nwhat we'll see--that if we have current\nprice of the underlyingand some assumptions on how\nthe market or the underlying", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.815}, {"text": "behaves, there is\nactually no uncertaintyin the price of the\noption, obviously,if we fix the pay-out.Right?So somehow there\nis no uncertainty.It's completely\ndeterministic, once weknow the price of

marketparticipants or counter-parties.It actually only depends on\nthe dynamics of the stock,only depends on the\nvolatility of the stock.And finally, the\nmost important ideaof this class-- that\nmathematical apparatusallows you to figure out how\nmuch this deterministic optionprice is now.So let's consider a very simple\nexample, a very simple market,two-period.So suppose our time is\ndiscrete, and we areone step before the maturity.So right now, our\nstock has price at 0.And there is some derivative\nf_0 with some pay-out.We'll consider a few of those.Right?Also, we'll add to\nthe mix a bit of cash.Right?Some amount of\nriskless cash B_0.And riskless meaning that\nit grows exponentiallywith some interest rate r.And there is no uncertainty.It's completely-- if you\nhave now B_0, we know then,in time dt, our B_0\nwill grow exponentially.It will become B e to the rt.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.502}, {"text": "So a bond, basically,\nzero-coupon bond.Or money market account, rather.If you go to Cambridge\nSavings Bank, put $1 in today,then in a year, you'll get\n$1 and basically nothingbecause interest rates are 0.So in time dt, we will assume\nwith some probability p,our market can go to the state\nwhere stock becomes S_1--the price of stock becomes S_1.Our bond grows exponentially--\nno uncertainty.And our derivative becomes f_1.Or with probability 1 minus p--\nonly two states, so-- our stockbecomes S_2.Bond stays the same.And the derivative is some f_2.So let's start with our simple\ncontract, the forward contract.So one can naively\napproach a problem, tryingto get the price\nof the derivative,using the real-world\nprobabilities, p and 1 minus p.Right?So we know that the pay-out\nis S minus K. That's given.So one would say\nthat if we know weare one step before the\npay-out, so let's justcompute expected\nvalue of the pay-out,using real-world\nprobabilities, get this value.And actually, what\nwe are looking hereis to set K such that the\nprice now at time t is 0.That's usual convention.So we'll then set K\nto this probability,to this number, which depends\non real-world

stock is\nas likely to go up then down.Then it's just an average of end\nstock prices or something else.But it's all hand-wavy.And actually, we\nnever will be right.Instead of doing\nthis-- we're kindof following bookie example--\nlet's try to do something else.Let's think a little bit.So we have a stock which\nis trading at market nowfor the price S_0.How about we go to the bank and\nborrow S_0 dollars right nowand immediately go to the\nmarket and buy the stock.So right now we are net 0.We borrowed S_0.We paid it immediately\nto buy the stock.So we have stock at hand.Then we'll wait for one period.And at the same\ntime-- sorry-- weenter on the short side\nof the forward contract.So we agree to sell the\nstock for some price K_0.So in dt, in one period of\ntime, the contract expires.We already have stock.So we just go and exchange\nit for K_0 dollars.Right?But at the same time, we need\nto repay our loan which now havebecome S_0 times e to the r*dt.This is deterministic, right?We borrowed S_0.In time dt, it became\nS times e to the r*dt.So what's our net?The net is K_0 minus\nS times e r*dt.So suppose K_0 is\ngreater than this value.Then we made riskless profit.There is no risk in the\nstrategy which we proposed.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.362}, {"text": "So this is good.But why wouldn't everybody\ndo it all day long?On the other hand, if\nK_0 is less than

now,the strike price has to\nbe equal to this amount.And there is no\nuncertainty about it.So let's stop and\nthink a little bit.Well, actually, just\nto see how it works.And that's exactly why I\nset this K to this number.So by the way, who\ncan tell me whichinterest rate does it imply?If our strike-- our stock price\nis $80, our strike is 88.41.And the expiry is in two\nyears,

rate is 5%.Yeah.So yeah.That's actually exactly 5\nexponentially compounded.Yeah.Well, in a good world--\nprobably five years ago,", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.194}, {"text": "that's how it would

up,\nsince the morning.Quite a bit, by the way.So yeah.So right now interest\nrates are basically 0.So these two lines would\nbe very close right nowif we were for two\nyears, in that case.So coming back to our example.So what's important here?How did we arrive to\nthis strike price,or to this price of\nthe forward contract?We, in fact, tried-- we\ntook some amount of stock.In this particular case, it\nwas the whole price of stock.We took some amount of cash, and\nby combining these two pieces,we somehow replicated\nthe final pay-off.Right?And that's the general idea\nof risk-neutral pricingand replicating portfolio.What we will try to do,\nin the rest of the class,is take a pay-off and try to\nfind a replicating portfolio,maybe more complicated, maybe\na dynamic such that at the end,this replicating portfolio\nwill be exactly our pay-off.Right?And what would it mean?Well, obviously it would\nmean that the current priceof the derivative\nshould be the priceof our

slightly,in such a way, which does remind\nus, taking an expected value,maybe discounting it because\nthis is expected valueat some time in the future.But this probability--\nand it is a

value of the derivative\nwill be just expectedvalue of our pay-out.And that's-- yeah.That's what I'm\ntrying to say, here.So now let's get into\ncontinuous world.Right?In continuous world, we'll\nneed some assumptionson the dynamics of\nour stock underlying.And let's make an assumption\nthat it is log-normal.What does it mean\nthat it's log-normal?It means that the proportional\nchange of the stock,over infinitely small\namount of time dt,has some drift mu, and\nsome stochastic component,which is just Brownian Motion.Right?So this dW is\ndistributed normallywith mean 0 and standard\ndeviation, whichis actually square root of dt.That's how Brownian\nMotion works.And that's extremely important,\nthat the standard deviationof Brownian Motion is\nsquare root of delta t.And

the standard\ndeviation of the BrownianMotion being on the scale\nof square root of t,we will need one\nmore term there.Right?So one term is df/dt by dt.Another is df by dS by dS.And the square of\ndS

substitute it here.We'll substitute df taken from\nour dS, which is like this,and dB.Let's not forget that dB--\nthat B is deterministic.Right?There is nothing\nuncertain about it.So dB is actually

dt,we'll get this expression here.But that's actually even\nmore the most important part.Then we'll go and use our\nknowledge that some partof our equation is deterministic\nand basically take f and a*Son one side and leave\nthe deterministic part,on the other side,\ndifferentiated once again.And left side will\nbe just r*B*dt.And if we substitute\nonce again df--and don't forget\nthat what we

current\nprice of a derivative--of any derivative.And how if we solve it,\nthen we should actuallybe able to know the\nprice of the derivative.So now how do we solve this\npartial differential
