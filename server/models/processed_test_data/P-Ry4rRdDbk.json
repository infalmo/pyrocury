to make the\nconnection betweenfunction and gene.But if we want to go the other\nway, we now have to do thebiochemistry of genetics.What's biochemistry about?It's purifying things\nin a test tube.What's genetics about?Heredity.So what do we have to do?We have to purify heredity\nin a test tube.But that's it.That's what we have to do.If we're going to make that\nconnection in that direction,all we need is to take a cell,\ngrind it up, and purify notthe enzyme that digests\na sugar, but heredity.We need to get a pure\ntube of heredity.You can imagine that this wasn't\nan obvious thing to do,how you get a pure\ntube of heredity.The problem is you\nneed an assay.If you want to find an\nenzyme that digests asugar, you have an acid.You purify different fraction,\nyou make different fractionsof a cell you see which fraction\nof the cell is ableto digest the sugar.But if I make different\nfractions of the cell, it'snot obvious how I figure out\nwhich fraction of the cell hasheredity in it.And yet, that's exactly\nwhat was done, andthat's today's lecture.So purifying heredity.The discovery of the\ntransforming principle.By the transforming principle,\nI don't mean an",

the\ntransforming principle, thetransforming substance.And it really is the work in\n1928 of a young scientist F.Griffiths in London.Griffiths was particularly\ninterested in studying thebacteria pneumococcus.Why was Griffith so interested\nin studying the bacteriapneumococcus?Well, not so long before in\n1918, there had been theterrible Spanish influenza\nepidemic that had killedmillions of people around the\nworld, the worst flu ever.Millions of people died by\nthis flew, and one of thereasons they died when they\nhave the flu was they gotpneumococcal infections.Griffiths was trying to make a\nvaccine against pneumococcus,a pretty good idea trying to\nmake a vaccine againstpneumococcus.Pneumococcus highly virulent\nstuff, but particularly ifyou're compromised\nby the influenza.So what did he do?Well, Griffiths had a strain\nof pneumococcus.He didn't, by the way, infect\npeople with it.He infected mice with it, that\nbeing considered a somewhatmore ethical way to\ndo the experiment.So he had a strain of\npneumococcus that had asmooth, glistening coat.When you looked at it, it\nwas smooth and white andglistened, the colonies\nthat it madesmooth, white, glistened.And it was virulent.If you inject it into a mouse,\nthe mouse got pneumococcusinfection, and it died.It turns out we now know\nthat it has a beautifulpolysaccharide coat around it\nthat provides resistance

didn't produce that\npolysaccharide, and therefore,was more easily fought off\nby the immune system.So Griffiths does the following\nexperiment.He takes his smooth, virulent\nbacteria, he injects it into amouse, that's a mouse.And what happens to the mouse?AUDIENCE: Dies.PROFESSOR: Dies.Exactly.That's a dead mouse.And one of the easier assays\nin molecular biology is thefeet up, feet down

culture on a Petri plate\nfrom this dead mouselive, smooth, virulent\nbacteria.How did that happen?Somehow, we didn't have any\nlive, smooth bacteria.We had dead, smooth bacteria.We had live

double helix\nso important?Well, the implication of the\ndouble helix is that if I havea double helix and those strands\nwere to separate, eachwould be a template for a\ndouble helix, heredity.How do you pass information\nto two daughter cells?You got a double helix.It's redundant.If you know the A is on\none strand, you knowthe Ts on the other.Unzip it, copy, voila.I now have two copies\nof

secret of life.Drinks for everybody, they write\nit up, but in the lastparagraph, they certainly don't\nwant anybody to thinkthat they missed the point.And they write the coyest\nsentence in molecular
