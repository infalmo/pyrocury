OK?Producers are these black boxes,\nwhere their goal is tomaximize their profits, which is\nrevenue minus cost. And thekey to maximizing profits\nis efficient production.The key to maximizing profits\nis going to be to producegoods as efficiently\nas possible.OK, so profit maximization\nrequires

jets, andthe guys in these lavish\nlifestyles, and that doesn'tseem very efficient\nproduction.I'll come back to that.OK, in a couple of lectures,\nwe'll talk about do firmsactually maximize profits,

functions.That's essentially the\ntechnology by which a firmtakes inputs, or what we call\nfactors of production, andturns them into outputs,\nis throughthis production function.So just like your utility\nfunction is a tool for whichwe take bundles of goods and\nturn them into happiness, aproduction function is a tool\nfor which we take bundles ofinputs and turn them\ninto outputs.OK, but something that's a\nlittle easier to understandthis, you could think of a\nfactory where stuff comes in,and think of a belt, a\nmechanical belt, going throughand stuff goes in and other\nstuff comes out.You could think of that\nproduction function.We're going to think about two\ndifferent kinds of inputs thatfirms are going to use.Once again, to make life easy,\nwe're going to assume firmsonly use two kinds of inputs.Later, we'll expand this, but\nfrom mostly intuition you canget from thinking about\nthis-- two kinds ofinputs, labor and capital.Labor and capital are the two\nkinds of inputs firms use.Labor is clear.It's just hours of labor,\nhours of work.OK?It's just hours of work\nin production.Capital is a lot trickier.And we'll spend a lot of time\nthis semester struggling withwhat capital really means.Basically for now, think of\ncapital as everything elsethat goes into production, the\nmachines, the buildings, theland, everything.Think of capital as everything\nelse that goes intoproduction.So basically, when you produce\nstuff, you produce it withworkers working with stuff.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.323}, {"text": "Capital's the stuff.Now, this capital is sort of a\ncomposite of everything elsethat goes into production.And once again, we'll add some\nmore detail on this later.OK, and the output is\nsome output, q.That's the units\nof production.That's the output that is\nproduced by the firm.So basically, we can think of a\nproduction function is q issome function of l and k.That's a production function,\nthat the output you produce asyour firm--and by the way, we're going to\nuse little q to represent afirm's output, and big Q to\nrepresent market output.OK, so little q, and if I slip\nin this, yell at me, OK?But we're going to try to\nconsistently use little q torepresent a given firm's output,\nand big Q to be themarket's output--So little q is some function of\nthe amount of workers youhave and the amount of\ncapital you use.Now, the important distinction\nwe're going to make here isbetween variable versus\nfixed inputs.Variable versus fixed inputs\nis an important distinctionwe're going to draw.Variable inputs are inputs that\nare easily changed, likehow many hours somebody works.In principle, you could just\nhave some work five hours oneday, one hour the next day, 10\nhours the day after that.It's easy to change\nhours of work.So that's a variable input.Fixed inputs are things which\nare harder to change quickly,like the size of the building\nthat the workersare building in.Once that building's built, it's\npretty hard to change it.You can't like lop off 2/3 of it\non one day and add it backthe next day.OK, that's more of\nthe fixed inputs.And this will lead to a critical\ndistinction forproduction

are\na lot of assumptions.But at the end of the day, I'm\ngoing to be able to teach youin a couple of lectures how\nfirms make decisions.And I'm going to be\nabout 80% right.So that's pretty good.OK, so there are some\nassumptions, but we're goingto go a long way with\nthese assumptions.So let's start by considering\nthe short run, and consideringthat period of time over\nwhich labor is

constant.The reason each worker does less\nis because they only havethe same amount of stuff\nto work with.And the classic example we\nuse here is the exampleof digging a hole.You go to dig a hole and your\ncapital's a shovel.And let's say for some reason\nthe shovels are out, so youcan't get another shovel\nfor a while.OK, so there's one shovel.So you have one worker digging\na hole, then the next

defined\nthe long run.So now a firm doesn't just\nchoose how many workers tohire, or how many hours\nof labor to buy.It chooses both l and k, and\nhas to trade them off, justlike you chose both pizzas\nand movies and hadto trade them off.So the long-run production\ntheory is the same, basicallythe same mechanics,\nas utility theory.There's a production function.You have two inputs.You trade them off.Just like you're a consumer.You have two goods to consume.You trade them off.The difference is going to be\nthat ultimately production isgoing to self--the difference is, when you\ndecide how to trade them offas a consumer, you're given\na budget constraint.The difference with production\nis the budget constraint isgoing to be itself determined\nby the same system.So you're not only going to\ndevelop your productionfunction, but you're going to\ndevelop your budget constraintand, you're going\nto decide both.It's a little bit funky\nbut we'll get to it.But for now, let's just think\nabout the parallels toconsumer theory, and think about\na production functionwhich is q--little q--is the square root\nof k times l.That same functional form I used\nwith pizza and movies,where utility is the square root\nof pizza times movies.Now I'm going to say what you\nproduce of your good is thesquare root of k times l.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.188}, {"text": "Now let's go to

all\nthe same mechanics.Just as there were sets of goods\nacross which you wereindifferent, two pizzas and one\nmovie versus one pizza andtwo movies.Isoquants are sets of\ninputs along whichproduction is the same.So along a given isoquant,\nq is fixed.Each of those isoquants is a\ndifferent level of q, but theyshow how you can vary k and l\nto get the same amount of q.So producing q equals\nsquare root of 2.I can use two units of capital\nand one unit of labor, or oneunit of capital and\ntwo of labor.So I can choose lots of\ncombinations of k and l alongthat isoquant to produce a\ngiven amount

undergraduateand a beanie baby.OK, perfectly substitutable.Figure 8-4a shows the\ncase of perfectlysubstitutable inputs.In that case, you would have a\nlinear isoquant, because whatthat would mean is

Once you get to the\namount of l you need to fillthe cereal boxes, it doesn't\nmatter, and vice versa.So basically, they're perfectly\nnon-substitutable.So all that determines your\noutput is which youhave the least of.OK, so substitutabilities\ndetermine the slope of theisoquants and of this\nproduction function.Now in general, we'll be\nin between these cases.There'll be some\nsubstitutability.Goods won't be perfectly\nsubstitutable, but they'll besomewhat substitutable.So in general, we'll be in\nbetween these cases.And more generally, just as the\nslope of the indifferencecurve is the marginal rate of\nsubstitution, the slope of theisoquant we will call the\nmarginal rate of technicalsubstitution.The marginal rate of technical\nsubstitution-- the rate atwhich you can substitute one\ninput for another in aproduction function is the\nmarginal rate of technicalsubstitution--which we'll define as delta k,\ndelta l for a given q bar, therate at which you can\ntrade off k for lto hold q bar fixed.Now, as with marginal rate of\nsubstitution, the marginalrate of technical substitution\nwillchange along the isoquant.So if you go to figure 8-5,\nhere we've drawn a typicalisoquant for the production\nfunction q equals square root", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.417}, {"text": "of k times l.So the production function\nis q equals the squareroot of k times l.And here's a isoquant.This is the isoquant\nof all combinationswhich produce two units.This is the q equals\n2 isoquant.Now, unlike utility--\nremember utility?--we said where u equals\n2 was meaningless.Utility was an ordinal concept,not a cardinal concept.Here, quantity is meaningful.If you produce four, you would\nhave only produced twice asmuch as if you produced two.We can care about both the\nordinality and the cardinalityof these outcomes.So we can say, what are the\ncombinations of inputs whichlead you to produce two units?What's all these combinations\nof inputs?So whereas you can have one unit\nof labor and four unitsof capital, two of each, or four\nunits of labor and oneunit of capital, all\nwill produce twounits of the output.And what you can see is that the\nmarginal rate of technicalsubstitution varies.So for instance, when we start\nwith four units of capital andone unit of labor, and we think\nabout adding a secondunit of labor, then the marginal\nrate of technicalsubstitution is minus 2.That is, one unit of labor is\nworth two units of capital.In other words, we can produce\nthe same amount of widgets ofq, but if we replace two units\nof capital with one unit oflabor, so at that point we're\nvery capital-intensive, andthat unit of labor\nis very valuable.On the other hand, now if you\nimagine we're down at 4-1, atthe third point--we are probably using\na, b, c--now we're at the third point,\nwhere you have we have fourunits of labor and one\nunit of capital.Now, if you'd be willing to\ngive up two units of laborjust to get one unit of capital,\nthat's the marginalrate of technical substitution\nis now minus 1/2.When you're very\nlabor-intensive, you'd behappy to give up a lot of labor\nto get a little capital.Once again, the principle of\ndiminishing marginal product,", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.285}, {"text": "just like the principle of\ndiminishing marginal utility,implies that the marginal rate\nof technical substitution isgoing to be falling as you\ngo down the isoquant.Just like the marginal rate of\nsubstitution fell as you wentdown the indifference curve, the\nmarginal rate of technicalsubstitution is going to fall\nas you go down the isoquant.And why is this?Once again it's because of\nthis diminishing marginalproductivity.That is, as you add more and\nmore labor, given capital,each unit of labor can\ndo less and less.And likewise, as you add more\nand more capital, given anamount of workers to use it,\neach unit of capital can doless and less.So it's a very different\napproach, but gets you thesame answer, which is with\nconsumption, each piece doesless and less for you, but we\ncan see that as consumers.Here's the notions of labor,\neach worker does less and lessfor you, holding\ncapital fixed.And each machine by the same\nlogic, if you have one guy inthe hole, it doesn't\nmatter how manyshovels you throw there.He still is only one guy.So each machines is doing less\nand less by the same logic.And those diminishing marginal\nproducts lead to thisdecreasing marginal rate of\ntechnical substitution as youmove along the isoquant.That's about the most technical\nstatement I'll makeall semester.OK, questions about that, about\nwhat's going on here?That's production theory.That's what you need to know\nto know basically how firmsproduce things.Now, what we're going to do\nis, now take this basicproduction theory, and turn it\ninto actually understandinghow firms make decisions\non how much to produce.But before we do that, I want\nto talk about

capital,half as much labor, half\nas much capital.So a change in scale is an equal\nincrease or decrease inall inputs?Equal proportional.So what happens if we increase\nall inputs, increase ordecrease proportionally?And this is an interesting case,\nbecause it's like, OK,what if we just make the\nfirm half as big?What happens?Well, the answer is,\nit depends onthe production process.Some production processes will\nexhibit what we call constantreturns to scale.This is a convenient form.It's convenient because the way\nconstant returns to scaleworks is, it says that f of\n2l, 2k, is equal to 2times f of l, k.That is, if it's constant, you\ncan just pull the 2 out.Doubling the inputs leads to\ndoubling the outputs, whichequals to 2q, I'll write here.Doubling the inputs equals\ndoubling the

you're an entrepreneur,\nyou've got a great idea, butit turns out that idea only\nworks if you really arehands-on about it.You're not Mark Zuckerberg, who\ncan just farm the thingout, it's really your

[INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Exactly.So it's the opposite, which is,\nlet's say you have an ideawhich is pretty good, but\nin fact it's replicable.And right now, you're trying\nto manage some guys.And then all of a sudden, when\nyou get twice as big, youbring other people in who can\neffectively replicate youridea, and really expand it\nin a very effective way.You can have increasing\nreturns to scale.Now, so an example of what that\nlooks like, if you go tothe last page in the handout,\nfigure 8-6a shows constantreturns to scale.So let's start with\n8-6a, that'sconstant returns to scale.So here-- and these are\nfrom the textbook--for example, when we doubled the\ninputs from 100 labor, 100capital, to 200 labor, 200\ncapital, you doubled output.Those are constant returns\nto scale isoquants.The last page shows\ndecreasing andincreasing returns to scale.So for instance, tobacco is an\nexample of decreasing returnsto scale, because there's only\nso much leaf that you havethat you can produce.So here, when you double the\ninputs from 100 to 200, youroutput only goes from\n100 to 142.OK, and if you want to double\nthe 200 units, you've got togo way the heck up\nthere on inputs.On the other hand, primary metal\nproduction is somethingwhere you can have increasing\nreturns to scale, becausethere's such high costs of\nbuilding a plant that onceit's built, so just like I said,\ngee, in fact that seconddigger of the hole might\nactually make it moreproductive.Once that plant's built, there's\none worker bangingaround the plant, a second\nworker adds a huge amount toproductivity because they\ncan specialize.Basically, increasing returns to\nscale is going to come fromspecialization.So if you build this big plant\nto build primary, to buildsteel, one worker in that plant\nis no good, because he'sgot to pour the steel,\nthen run over andcool it down, et cetera.Once you have two, they can\nspecialize, and three, theycan specialize more.", "start": 2040.0,

more than\ndoubling the output.Now we're going to talk\nabout all these cases.Typically, economists are\nsuspicious of increasingreturns to scale.Anybody, anybody who ever has an\nIPO, whoever starts a firmwill always tell you\nthat they haveincreasing returns to scale.Well, we say, I've got a great\nidea and the bigger, the more,the better it's going to be.And they're generally wrong.Generally, we think of\nincreasing returns to scale asbeing like a free lunch.And we don't like free lunches,\nwe economists.We think, gee, if it's really\nincreasing returns to scale,you would have already\nexpanded there.OK, if it's really such a good\nidea to get bigger, why aren'tyou bigger already?Now, it doesn't mean you can--Yeah.AUDIENCE: Well, they\nneed capital.PROFESSOR: Well, they need\ncapital, and so that would betheir argument.And that's great.And typically, they're wrong.But that would be why you would\nargue that they needcapital to get bigger.So typically, we like decreasing\nreturns to scale.That's going to be our\nsort of defaultassumption of the world.In other words, here's a way to\nthink about it, think aboutwe're dealing with mature firms.\nWe're modeling, forinstance, mature firms.We think that for mature firms,\nat least, there's notincreasing returns to scale,\nbecause in a mature firm theywould have hit that\npoint already.Now they're on the\ndecreasing part.So that's where we're\ngoing to focus forthe rest of the semester.OK, let me stop there.And good luck tomorrow night.And we'll come back\nto talk more aboutproduction on
