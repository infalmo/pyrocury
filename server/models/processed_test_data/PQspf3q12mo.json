my\nname is Al Haggerty.And we're going to try\nto get you orientedhere in what we call this, The\nStart of Your Lean Journey.There we go.So by the time we\nget done, you'regoing to be able\nto differentiatebetween Lean and Six Sigma.And I know that one\nof the attendeestoday mentioned that\nthat's why they came.We're going to talk\nabout the 5S tool.That's a derivative of\nthe original Japanese Leanconcepts.And we're going\nto able to definethe difference between\nLean and a lean enterpriseand stakeholders and\nrecognize why lean six sigmaprinciples are being implemented\nin aerospace, because it'sturned out to be a very,\nvery, very valuable tool.And the fact that today\nis day one of a journey,It's not something that you\njust do once and finish.And I was reviewing some\nof the latest changes,and my wife said, gee, you've\ndone this a lot of times.What are you doing?I said, we're on version six.And she said, what?You changed it six times?And I said, this is\ncontinuous improvement.So we're going to\ntalk about that.This is a excerpt from The\nMachine That Changed the World.And some time, if you get\na chance, get that book.And Womack and Jones, an ex-MIT\nprofessor, he's still alive,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.422}, {"text": "and he's still kicking, and\nvery, very interesting guy--developed a whole bunch of data.But it started with the\nautomobile industry.The book The\nMachine That Changedthe World is about the\nautomobile industry.And in the late 1800s,\ncars were brand new,and they were assembled by hand.And then Henry Ford\nrevolutionized the productionof cars.And the big thing\nthat he came up withwas interchangeable parts.Because before that,\nwe handmade parts.And he came up with\nthe concept, that if wecould make all the\nparts the same,we could put them\nin an assembly line.And that started\nthe mass production.Well, along came Toyota,\nafter World War II.And Toyota made this\nhuge improvementin how we build cars.Part of it was the concept of\nstatistical process control,in terms of how they\nliterally made the parts.But they invented the\nwhole concept of lean.And as you may know, last year,\n2007, which just finished,the Toyota production now\nexceeded General Motorsproduction for the first time.And from market\ncapitalization, numbersof shares times the\nvalue of the stock,they're the largest\nautomobile manufacturers.And as you know, we've gone\nthrough a lot of problemswith Chrysler, was part\nof the Daimler-Benzuntil just recently, when\nCerberus just bought them back.But our automobile\nindustry is in trouble.I just read the other day that\nGeneral Motors lost $36 billionlast year.Part of that was\nbuying back the rightsof the displaced workers,\nthe severance payand that kind of stuff,\nand their health care,and so forth.But you can see the difference\nbetween, if you look at this,the auto production\nin the US, these guys,and with the ups and downs.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.428}, {"text": "And every time you\ndo one of these,we get these giant layoffs.The nice, smooth\nJapanese productionis as a function of Lean.They continue to improve, and\nthey have a stable workforce.Their products continue\nto be better and better.I do a lot of\njogging, and if youjog along the road\nand all that, youtake a look at the old cars.The old cars that\ncome down the road--there are Hondas and Toyotas and\nthe Japanese-owned automobiles.The old Chevys and\nthe old Fords, I mean,you see some of them.But they don't last as long.And a good reason is-- the fact\nis that these cars, I mean,I tell industry groups.I mean, you ask any\ncollege kid about drivinga car after 200,000\nmiles, and they'll say,yeah, I got a Corolla,\nor I got a Camry.I've got a Honda.And there's a reason for it.Because the fact is\nthat they have allthe bells and whistles.And all the bells and\nwhistles keep working.So we just talked about that.In the post-world War II\nperiod, General MacArthurwanted to rebuild the\nindustry as part of his--he was the Supreme Allied\nCommander in Japan,and he tried to get\nthe industry going.And he brought Deming\nfrom MIT, basically,to help get the [INAUDIBLE]\na bunch of experts.And he instituted a lot of the\nstatistical process control.And the Japanese took it for\ngranted-- not for granted.They said they did\nit with a passion.Whereas, in the US, we didn't.And therefore, their\ncars and their productshave worked\nsignificantly better.So if you take a look at\nthe early craft concept thatwas used in the Industrial\nRevolution in past,just think of a\njeweler, a watchmaker.Each one of those little\nparts was made by handand filed by hand, put together.And if you wanted\nto become a jeweler,you became an apprentice.And then you became\na journeyman.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.337}, {"text": "And then you became\na master craftsman.And that was how, in fact,\nyou made the kinds of parts.And if, in fact, you could think\nof a better way of doing it,the master craftsmen\nwould do it.But it was not spread anywhere.I mean, maybe he would teach\nhis apprentice, or so forth.But mass production, which\nwe just talked about,Henry Ford, that\nkind of concept,if we were going\nto build years ago,if I was going to\nbuild 12 Apaches,we'd put 14 parts in the\nline, 14 sets of everything.Why 14, if we're\ngoing to build 12?Because we're going\nto scrap them.We don't do that anymore.But that was typical\nwhat we would do.And that's pure waste.And the concept was mass\nproduction, reduce the cost,get the efficiency up.And there's no question that\nthis was a lot more productivethan the master build it one\nat a time kind of a thing,of a craft person.But here's a big difference.Inspection was a second stage.We would build it and\ninspect it, build the partand inspect it.Today, in Lean thinking, we\nbuild the quality processinto the production of the part.And we're going to show you\nlater on that inspectiondoes not catch all the errors,\ndoes not catch all the errors.In fact, I guess the\npoker chips that we justsaw before was a good\ndemonstration of that.And another\nsignificant improvementis that the master, the master\ncarpenter, the master furniturebuilder, the master\nbricklayer, any innovationwas driven by the guy\nthat was doing the work.Here, we had industrial\nengineers and manufacturingengineers, expert periodic\nimprovements to the process.Under the Lean concept, we want\nevery worker to contribute,every worker to contribute\nin terms of being able--there's no question, that\nthe real experts in the job,are the people that\ndo it every day.And trying to glean\nthat informationis part of the value\nof Lean thinking.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.405}, {"text": "And the biggest thing is really\nthe focus on the customer.See here the craft--the jeweler was focused on the\ntask of building that watch.The mass production\nfocused on automobiles.Well, we still want\nto build automobiles.But the focus was\non the product.Here, on the Lean\nthinking, we'retrying to deliver\nvalue to the customer.And we'll talk more\nabout that later on--but trying to deliver value.Want to deliver a Mach 1.6,\nsupercruise high payload,vertical-- or short-- takeoff\nand vertical landing aircraft,called an F-35, to\nthe war fighter.That's the value.And we want to be able to do\nit for $35 million apiece.That is the value\nto the Air Force,which is the macro customer.The pilot and the mechanic\nare the detail customersof how we think--so big, big difference in the\nway we approach the concept.Now, we talked about Six Sigma.Six Sigma was developed\nby Motorola in the '80s.Now, not too many people\nwear pagers anymore.But when I was a\nyoung engineer, Iremember that it was sort\nof like a status symbolto have a pager.I never got one of\nthe darn things.But pagers were a big deal.And Motorola pioneered\nthat business.And they had 80% market share.Until, once again, the Japanese\nand the Koreans came along,and they added a whole bunch\nof features to those things,where they could tell you--when the buzzer went off,\nthey could tell you who it wasand where they were coming\nfrom and what time it was,and a whole bunch of features.And they delivered it to\nthe United States cheaper.And all of a sudden, Motorola's\nbusiness went in the tank.And they tried to analyze\nwhat was going on.And they decided that--they did a Pareto analysis.And we'll teach you\nabout Pareto charts here.But they basically\nmade a rankingof what the issues were.And one of the biggest\nissues was the fact", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.31}, {"text": "is that they had to scrap and\nrework a bunch of these pagers.And their quality was not\nas good as the Japanese,and they didn't last as long.The pagers didn't last as\nlong, for quality reasons.And so they said,\nhow can we fix this?And basically started to apply\nthe Deming statistical processcontrol to the various design\nprocesses, manufacturingprocesses, and so forth,\nto improve their quality.And they regained\ntheir market share.They regained their\nmarket share on the pager.So anyway, Motorola,\nin the '80s-- in fact,I live in Scottsdale,\nArizona, now.And the Motorola facility was\nthe one there that did that.But it was improving quality\nby eliminating defects.And the concept is\nreduce variation.We're going to talk\na lot about that.But under Lean, we're\ntrying to remove waste.And waste is not\nthe fact that peoplecome to work every\nday to waste things.It turns out that\nwaste is-- the factis, if this is the\nperfect way of doing it,and we're doing it now, the\ndifference between what we'redoing now and how good it could\nbe is a definition of waste.The Six Sigma is focused on\nthose issues, a variationthat, in fact, causing a\nproblem, we focus on the flow.And you're going to hear the\nterm pull, versus push, and soforth, as we go through this.And we're trying to\nget rid of the wasteto improve the\nbusiness performance.And it's a lot of\nsmall improvements,many of them coming\nfrom the workers whodo the job every day.And I had to work in a--Boeing sent me to Japan.And I worked in a Japanese\nfactory for a weekand after two days\nof training, hadto improve the productivity\nof a Japanese worker,who was making large\nindustrial air conditioners.And that guy was 55 years old.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.258}, {"text": "And he was moving so fast.And my job was to improve\nhis productivity by 30%.And I thought to myself,\nthere is no workerin the United States that's\nworking as hard and as fastas this guy.And he was doing all these jobs.And I had to figure out that\nliterally, it was a repetitivejob and try to improve.But it was a combination.I did it, but it was a\ncombination of a whole bunchof small things.And that's what\nwe're trying to do.So we're going to learn a lot\nabout variation and the factthat variation causes\nproblem and the fact--we're going to talk about flow\nand how to get the waste outof the process.AUDIENCE: Question.ALLEN HAGGERTY: Yes, sir?AUDIENCE: A simple [INAUDIBLE].Where does the

basically, in statistics,\nsigma, in terms of variation--so one sigma is 30% of the part,\ntwo sigma is 66%, three sigma,so forth.Six Sigma is 99.99999%\nperfect kind of stuff.AUDIENCE:

problemon the Apache Attack helicopter\nadvanced composite rotor bladeprogram.And there's a\n[? root end ?] problem,and I was there to fix it.But we literally\ntake six specimens.It has nothing to\ndo with Six Sigma,per se, but six specimens, and\nthen run out the fatigue testand determine what the high\nconfidence 99.999% stress levelis that we can guarantee\nthe life of the part.And so it's used a lot.We talk about the fact that Lean\noptimizers flow and eliminateswaste.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.223}, {"text": "Six Sigma stresses quality for\nthe elimination of variation.And certain companies have put\nall their focus on Six Sigma.And other companies\nhave adopted Lean.And over the last\n10 or 15 years,we've seen a convergence\nof companies that use both,and the idea being is, that if\nthe basic quality problem issomething that we can apply Six\nSigma methods, it makes sense.But quite often,\nin the big picture,the flow is all mixed up.And therefore,\nwe're concentratingon eliminating the\nwaste in the flow.So there's a lot of\ncompanies that, in fact,instead of having a Six Sigma--General Electric, for example--and instead of a pure\nLean, have, in fact,merged those two.And so you can see\nhere, Rockwell Collinscalls it Lean\nElectronics, Textron--Six Sigma.The Air Force new\nsystem is AFSO21.Boeing now calls it Lean +.And that's a change just\nin the last two years.So all of these things\nhave merged together.So we're going to talk about\nthe fundamental concepts thatunderscore both of those.We were talking about\nsomeone mentioned,early in the icebreaker,

we'll go through those.And believe it or not, when\nyou take your value testat the end, you'll be a\nlot more knowledgeableand to be able to explain\nreally what those are.So that's good.And I won't

you\nknow, look, thisis what we're willing\nto pay, and this is whatwe think is reasonable profit--same as this, 10% or 15%.And if we're going\nto buy it from you,you better get your cost down.Otherwise, A, you don't\nget the business, or B,you don't make any money.So the customer\ndetermines the price.And we in industry have to lower\nthe cost to achieve the profit.So when we go through\na design process,our design has to come up\nwith the fact is that we'vegot to meet the range--you guys are aero\nengineers-- rangeand payload and reliability\nand maintainability,and so forth, all\nof those specs.But one of the key\nspecifications--we're going to talk more about\nthis when we talk about cost--one of the key specifications\nnow is achieving the cost.So we talk about
