the\nChinese should be not saving,because their wages are\ngoing up very fast.Our theory clearly said that,\nand we don't really know whythey say so.Well, we have some theories.I might come back to\nthat next time.But I want to just keep this\ngeneral principle in mind,which is that the one solid\nreason not to save is youexpect your income\nto grow a lot.Whether that works\nor not

China's and savings.So if anybody's interested.PROFESSOR: Yeah, so that's\na good topic to write.Chinese savings is a great topic\nto write an essay about.OK, another reason people often\ncite for why peopledon't save is they don't\nhave any money.How could they save?Does that argument make sense?When does it make sense?So it's a very common\nargument.How could the poor save?They don't have any money.Is savings primarily\nabout having money?So let me put it differently.To a first approximation,\nsavings is about making surethat there isn't a future where\nI've eaten everythingthat I have.So if I have money today, unless\nI expect to get richertomorrow, then even if I'm poor,\nI should save, becauseit's not about whether\nI have money or not.If I'm poor today, then I'm\ngoing to be poor tomorrow.Then it's no different\nfrom I'm richtoday, I'm rich tomorrow.We have the same incentives to\nsave, because what you'retrying to achieve is efficient\ndivision of consumptionbetween today and tomorrow.So the fact that I'm poor\nshould not, per se, sayanything about whether I should\nsave or not, becausesavings is about trading off\nconsumption today withconsumption tomorrow.And that same trade-off\nexists, whetheryou're poor or rich.If I'm poor, I still\nhave it tomorrow.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And if I have it tomorrow,\nthen I should still save.Because if I'm worried that\ntomorrow I'm not going to haveany money, that's true\nfor somebody poorand somebody rich.So the fact that I have\nlittle money today--if I'm going to have even less\nmoney tomorrow, I should save.So it's not about how much money\nyou have, but how muchmoney you expect to have\nin the future.That's the same general\nprinciple that wewent through a minute.Having said that, is there a\ncase where being poor mightmake you not save?What's a case where this\nargument kind of fails?AUDIENCE: Well, if your income\nis so small that you have toconsume all of it today just\nto make it tomorrow.PROFESSOR: Exactly.Excellent example.So one reason even the poor\nmay not want to save ifthey're really so poor that\ntomorrow will not show up ifthey don't eat today.In that case, there's no\nargument for saving, becausethen you would, in any\ncase, not get there.So you're desperately poor and\nyou're starving, you probablyshouldn't save.But if you're not that poor,\nthen the fact that you don'thave income should not\nmatter that much.Or even a lot of income should\nnot matter that much.So another example how many of\nyou already suggested, anotherargument for why people don't\nsave is that people just don'thave opportunities to save.Like many of you suggested,\ninflation.So imagine that the only\nway I can save is bykeeping cash at home.And prices go up, so cash\nbecomes less valuable.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "In other words, there's just no\npoint in trying to save inthat world, because you're in a\nhyperinflation or something,and any money you put away\nis going to be valuelesstomorrow, why bother saving?So one answer to that is that,\nwell, why not put it into abank account, or into an\ninvestment account?So you buy something that\nthat's inflation-proof.Why don't you buy an\ninflation-proof governmentbond or something?So there are assets.You could buy gold.So if you still make the\nargument that the poor areparticularly handicapped,\nbecause they don't have aplace to save, you have to make\nthe argument that theyhave less access to\nbank accounts.And that's true.In the world, it's true.It's completely true that the\npoor have very limited accessto bank accounts.Most countries--like below 20% of the poor- have\naccess to bank accounts.So that's very true.And if you take investment\naccounts or other money

accounts?Why should it be that\nthey have notaccess to bank accounts?What are arguments?Yeah?AUDIENCE: They might live in a\nregion where it doesn't makesense to have a bank.Like, if you're in a small-world\nvillage, there'sreally not the infrastructure\nor the skill for the bank tobe sustainable there.Likewise, the size of their\ndeposits might make it whereeven if they are in, say,

seen in certain money\nlending, that the sizeof their deposit wouldn't be\nworthwhile for the hassle thatit would involve.PROFESSOR: Right.So that's exactly right.So basic argument is that\nwhenever I want to have adeposit-taking institution--any institution that\ntakes your money--once I take your money, there\nis a cost of that, which iskind of fixed, and doesn't\nentirely scale withthe amount of money.So if I'm putting in $5, and the\ncost is $5 to take care ofyour money, nobody's going\nto be willing to do it.So you need enough deposits\nto make a bank work.What will be reasons why there's\na fixed cost, thefixed cost of banking?Why does banking have\na fixed cost?Why should it have\na [INAUDIBLE]?AUDIENCE: Well you need to at\nleast hire some number ofpeople to set up the system.[INAUDIBLE]someone working at the bank,\nsomeone who will keep track ofall the records. things\nlike that.PROFESSOR: Right.So I think one version of that\nis that banks are required bylaw to keep good records of\nany deposits they take.And so even if the deposit is\n$5, they can't just say, well,we're going to just scribble it\ndown on a piece of paper.So basically, every deposit that\ncomes to a bank has to berecorded in a proper way.Given that, even if it's $5,\nsomebody has to have acomputer there, open a computer,\nenter the amountinto the computer, send\nit to some place.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So there's a lot of reasons\nwhy they'refixed costs of banking.And I think that's the single\nbiggest reason why most poorpeople don't have access\nto bank accounts.Now the alternative is\nto save at home.And there are many reasons why\nit's difficult to ave at home.One has something to\ndo with inflation.If you keep money and\nthe prices go up.Another problem is crime.You keep money at home,\nsomebody comes andtakes it, it's gone.You kept it a bank, it's a\nbank's duty to keep it safe.So that's another reason\nwhy you can do it.And then there are what I'm\ncalling the self-controlledand spouse-controlled reasons.So self-control is, if I\nhave money, I spend it.If I don't have it, maybeI don't spend It.So it's in the bank.It's not in my hand.I'm not going to be\nable to spend it.If it's really in my pocket,\nI'll just spend it.I see something I\nwant, I buy it.What's spouse control?What do you think it is?What's your guess?AUDIENCE: Your spouse might ask\nyou for money [INAUDIBLE]because they want it for\nsomething [INAUDIBLE]based on [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Right.So it may well be that some\npeople in the family

if it does,then somebody always shows\nup and asks for it.And it could be a spouse, could\nbe your brother, couldbe some friend.But if there's a lot of people\nwho come and ask money fromyou, then you

individual inthe ROSCA gets that lump sum\non alternating days.So each individual will get\nthe lump sum at some pointPROFESSOR: Exactly.So one form of ROSCA is one\nwhere there's a fixed order.",

of it.Next week, everybody puts $10,\nand Mr. Two gets all of it.And so, in the end, everybody\ngets all $50.But a lottery determines\nwho gets it first.So if you think of a ROSCA,\nwhat's the advantage of aROSCA over just saving\nat home?Is there an advantage?What are the advantages?Yeah?AUDIENCE: You don't need the\ndiscipline to make sure thatyou're saving money, because\nif you have

could\nspend $2 out of that onsome pack off cigarettes\nor something, and so.And you never reach $50.So the fact that there's a\nmatching between the amount ofthe ROSCA and the\namount to what Iwant to buy is important.That's part of the reason to\nsolve the self-control problemis because of this matching.Because once I have the money,\nI can just spend it.If I need $50, if I have to save\nup to it, then there'llbe a lot of times when\nI have less than $50.And I could say, well, maybe\nI'll just spend $2 out of it,and wait another day,\nand put in $2 back,you never get there.Whereas this gives you $50\nall at once, and youimmediately spend it.So one advantage of it is\ndelivers the amount you want.What's another advantage?Think of the group of us.Let's say we each need $50.How long on average would it\ntake us to get to $50 if wesaved by ourselves, and we\nsaved, let's say, $10 a week?AUDIENCE: The advantage of a\nROSCA would be potential for aimmediacy, access to the\nlarge sums of funds.And even if you're the last\nperson in the ROSCA, thatamount of time it takes you to\ndeal with that amount of moneywould be the same as if you were\nsaving it by yourself,whereas the guy who's first gets\nit immediately, and thenit averages out to half the\namount of time [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Exactly.So if you save $50, it would\ntake five weeks for each ofyou, whereas the expected

obviously, is going to.And what's happening, notice,\nis that the potis now going up.So I pay $10 into the pot\nto get the extra $10.That can be distributed\namong everybody else.And so, everybody

interestson their savings.So they they're paying\n$10, but I'm actuallygiving them $10 back.So they're getting some interest\non their savings.This turns it into much\nmore like a bank.A bidding ROSCA

the same time.And so, if you have a variable\nincome, then it might not besuitable for you to try to\nsave that same amount[INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Exactly.So two disadvantages.One is it's inflexible.You are to put in $10 every\ntime, and if your income isvariable, you may not want\nto save $10 every time.And the other is that it's\ntypically short-term.So if you want to save

other disadvantages or\nlimitations, let's say?Yeah?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Right.So the amount in ROSCAs tend\nto be quite limited, andthey're limited precisely by\nthe fact that it creates

there\nwere not very many goodsavings products available.And well, for him, it was\nsomething that was going toalways have value.And so, for him, it was a very\nlogical way whenever he gotsome money, he would\npark it intoanother room in the house.So if you look, every\nroom in the househas a different floor.And you can tell that the tiles\nthat were used to buyfor room one had run out by the\ntime you got to room two,because that was five\nyears later.So there was a different\nset of tiles,or different flooring.So every room had a different\nfloor, different color,different tile,
