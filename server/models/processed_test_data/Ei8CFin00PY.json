kindly--\nProfessor Evanshas very kindly agreed\nto do an experiment.Yeah, so for those\nof you all whoare in recitations\nboth he and Bartontalked about polarization\nin recitation last week.And Matt will pick\nit up from there.MATTHEW EVANS: So back\nto the ancient past--this was a week ago.We had our\nhyper-intelligent monkeysthat were sorting things.It all seemed very theoretical.And in recitation, I said\nthings about polarizers.And I said, look, if\nwe use polarizers,we can do exactly the same\nthing as these monkeys.We just need to set up a\nlittle polarization experimentand the results are identical.You can use the one\nfigure out the other.But I didn't have this or\na nice polarizer ready thento give a demo, so here we go.What I'm going to show\nyou is that, if we startwith something polarized here\nwith all white-- and rightnow I have all vertical\npolarization here--and if I just put\non this other boxthere, which is going to be\nanother polarizer, if I put itthe same way, this is all\nof our white electronscoming through all white.See?It doesn't really do much.And if I look at the\nblack output over hereof the second Keller\nsorting box, that'sthe same as turning my\npolarizer 90 degrees,so nothing comes out black.So if we remove this\nguy from the middle,you have just exactly\nwhat you'd expect.You sort here, you have white,\nand you get all white out.Great.Everyone thought that was easy.We all had that figured out.This box got thrown\nin the center hereand it became sort of confusing,\nbecause you thought, well,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "they were white--\nI'm going to throwmy box in the middle here--\nthat's this guy at 45 degrees.And then if I throw this guy\non the end again, the idea was,well, they were all white\nhere, so maybe this guyidentified the soft ones\nfrom the white ones.And now we have white and soft.And it should still\nall be white, right?So I put this guy on up here.They should all come out\nbut they sort of don't.And if you say,\nwell, are they black?Well, no, they're not\nreally black, either.They're some sort of strange\ncombination of the two.All right, so that's this\nexperiment done in polarizers.But let me just play the\npolarizer trick a little bit,because it's fun.So this is if I say,\nvertical polarizationand how many of them\ncome out horizontal?So here I'm saying, white,\nand how many of themwill come out black?That's the analogy.The answer is none of them.And strangely, if I\ntake this thing, whichseems to just attenuate--\nthis is our middle box here--and I just stuff\nit in between them,I can get something to come\nout even though I stillhave crossed\npolarizers on the side.So you can see the middle\nregion is now brighterand you can still see\nthe dark corners thereof the crossed polarizers.And as I turn this guy around,\nI can make that better or worse.The maximum is\nsomewhere right there,and then it goes off again.So this is a way\nof understandingour electron-sorting,\nhyper-intelligent monkeysin terms of polarizations.And here it's just\na vector projectedon another vector projected\non another vector-- somethingeverybody knows how to do.So here's the\npolarization analogyof the Stern-Gerlach experiment.PROFESSOR: Awesome.So the polarization analogy\nfor interference effectsin quantum mechanics\nis a canonical onein the texts of\nquantum mechanics.So you'll find lots of\nbooks talking about this.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "It's a very useful\nanalogy, and Iencourage you to\nread more about it.We won't talk about\nit a whole lot more,but it's a useful one.All right, before\nI get going, anyquestions from last lecture?Last lecture was pretty\nmuch self-contained.It was experimental results.No, nothing?All right.The one thing that I\nwant to add to the lastlecture-- one last\nexperimental observation.I glossed over\nsomething that's kindof important, which\nis the following.So we started off\nby saying, look,we know that if I\nhave a ray of light,it's an electromagnetic\nwave, and ithas some wavelength lambda.And yet the photoelectric\neffect tells usthat, in addition to having the\nwavelength lambda, the energy--it has a frequency, as\nwell, a frequency in time.And the photoelectric\neffect suggestedthat the energy is\nproportional to the frequency.And we write this as h nu and\nh bar is equal to h upon 2 piand omega is equal to 2 pi nu.So this is just the angular\nfrequency, rather thanthe number-per-time frequency.And h bar is the\nreduced Planck constant.So I'll typically write h\nbar omega rather than h nu,because these two pi's will\njust cause us endless pain if wedon't use the bar.Anyway, so to an\nelectromagnetic wave,we have a wavelength\nand a frequencyand the photoelectric\neffect led usto predict that the\nenergy is linearlyproportional to the frequency,\nwith the linear proportionalitycoefficient h bar-- Planck\nconstant-- and the momentumis equal to h upon\nlambda, also knownas-- I'm going to write\nthis as h bar k, which", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "is equal to h upon\nlambda, where here, again,h bar is h upon 2 pi.And so k is equal\nto 2 pi upon lambda.So k is called the\nwave number and youshould have seen this in 8.03.So these are our basic\nrelations for light.We know that light, as\nan electromagnetic wave,has a frequency\nand a wavelength--or a wave number, an\ninverse wavelength.And the claim of the\nphotoelectric effectis that the energy and\nthe momenta of that lightare thus quantized, that\nlight comes in chunks.So it has a wave-like\naspect and it alsohas properties that are more\nfamiliar from particles.Now, early on shortly after\nEinstein proposed this,a young French physicist named\nde Broglie said, well, look,OK, this is true of light.Light has both wave-like and\nparticle-like properties.Why is it just light?The world would be\nmuch more parsimoniousif this relation were true\nnot just of light, but alsoof all particles.I am thus conjecturing,\nwith no evidence whatsoever,that, in fact,\nthis relation holdsnot just for light,\nbut for any object.Any object with momentum p has\nassociated to it a wavelengthor a wave number,\nwhich is p upon h bar.Every object that has energy\nE has associated with ita wave with frequency omega.To those electrons that we send\nthrough the Davisson-Germerexperiment apparatus, which are\nsent in with definite energy,there must be a frequency\nassociated with it, omegaand a wavelength lambda\nassociated with it.And what we saw from the\nDavisson-Germer experimentwas experimental confirmation\nof that prediction--that electrons have both\nparticulate and wave-likefeatures simultaneously.So these relations are called\nthe de Broglie relations or \"de", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "BROG-lee\"-- I leave it up to\nyou to decide how to pronouncethat.And those relations are going\nto play an important role for usin the next few lectures.I just wanted to give them\na name and a little context.This is a good example of\nparsimony and elegance--the theoretical\nelegance leading youto an idea that turns out\nto be true of the world.Now, that's a dangerous\nstrategy for finding truth.Boy, wouldn't it be nice if--?Wouldn't it be nice if we\ndidn't have to pay taxesbut we also had Medicare?So it's not a terribly\nuseful guide all the time,but sometimes it\nreally does lead youin the right direction.And this is a great example\nof physical intuition,wildly divorced from\nexperiment, pushing youin the right direction.I'm making it sound a little\nmore shocking than-- well,it was shocking.It was just shocking.OK, so with that said,\nlet me introduce the movesfor the next few lectures.For the next several lectures,\nhere's what we're going to do.I am not going to give you\nexperimental motivation.I've given you\nexperimental motivation.I'm going to give you a set\nof rules, a set of postulates.These are going to be the\nrules of quantum mechanics.And what quantum\nmechanics is for usis a set of rules to allow\nus to make predictionsabout the world.And these rules will be awesome\nif their predictions are good.And if their predictions are\nbad, these rules will suck.We will avoid bad rules\nto the degree possible.I'm going to give you what\nwe've learned over the past 100years-- wow-- of developing\nquantum mechanics.That is amazing.Wow.OK, yeah, over\nthe past 100 yearsof developing quantum mechanics.And I'm going to give them to\nyou as a series of postulatesand then we're going to work\nthrough the consequences,and then we're going to spend\nthe rest of the semesterstudying examples to develop\nan understanding for whatthe rules of quantum\nmechanics are giving you.So we're just going to\nscrap classical mechanicsand start over from scratch.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So let me do that.And to begin, let me start with\nthe definition of a system.And to understand\nthat definition,I want to start with classical\nmechanics as a guide.So in classical mechanics--\nlet's think about the easiestclassical system you can--\njust a single particlesitting somewhere.In classical mechanics\nof a single particle,how do you specify the\nconfiguration, or the state--just different words\nfor the same thing--how do you specify\nthe configurationor state of the system?AUDIENCE: By position\nand momentum.PROFESSOR: Specify the\nposition and momentum, exactly.So in classical mechanics, if\nyou want to completely specifythe configuration of a\nsystem, all you have to dois give me x and\np for my particle.And if you tell me\nthis, I know everything.If you know these numbers,\nyou know everything.In particular, what\nI mean by sayingyou know everything is that,\nif there's anything elseyou want to measure--\nthe energy, for example.The energy is just some function\nof the position and momentum.And if you know the\nposition and momentum,you can unambiguously\ncalculate the energy.Similarly, the angular\nmomentum, which is a vector,you can calculate\nit if you know xand p-- which is just r cross p.So this gives you complete\nknowledge of the system.There's nothing more to\nknow if you know that data.Now, there are certainly\nstill questionsthat you can't answer\ngiven knowledge of x and p.For example, are there\n14 invisible monkeysstanding behind me?I'm here.I'm not moving.Are there 14 invisible\nmonkeys standing behind me?You can't answer that.It's a stupid question, right?OK, let me give you\nanother example.The electron is x\nand p, some position.Is it happy?Right, so there are still\nquestions you can't answer.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "The point is, complete\nknowledge of the systemto answer any physically\nobservable question--any question that could\nbe meaningfully turnedinto an experiment,\nthe answer iscontained in knowing\nthe state of the system.But this can't possibly be\ntrue in quantum mechanics,because, as you saw\nin the problem setand as we've\ndiscussed previously,there's an uncertainty\nrelation whichsays that your knowledge--\nor your uncertainty, rather,in the position of\na particle, quantummechanically--\nI'm not even goingto say quantum mechanically.I'm just going to\nsay the real world.So in the real world,\nour uncertaintyin the position of\nour point-like objectand our uncertainty\nin the momentumis always greater than or\nroughly equal to somethingthat's proportional\nto Planck's constant.You can't be arbitrarily\nconfident of the positionand of the momentum\nsimultaneously.You worked through a\ngood example of thison the problem set.We saw this in the\ntwo-slit experimentand the interference\nof electrons.This is something we're\ngoing to have to deal with.So as a consequence,\nyou can't possiblyspecify the position\nand the momentumwith confidence of a system.You can't do it.This was a myth.It was a good approximation--\nturned out to be false.So the first thing\nwe need is to specifythe state, the\nconfiguration of a system.So what specifies the\nconfiguration of a system?And so this brings us\nto the first postulate.The configuration, or\nstate, of a system--and here again,\njust for simplicity,I'm going to talk about a single\nobject-- of a quantum objectis completely specified by\na single function, a wave", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "function, which I\nwill denote generallypsi of x, which is\na complex function.The state of the quantum\nobject is completelyspecified once you know the wave\nfunction of the system, whichis a function of position.Let me emphasize that this is\na first pass at the postulates.What we're going to do is go\nthrough the basic postulatesof quantum mechanics, then we'll\ngo through them again and givethem a little more generality.And then we'll go through\nthem again and give themfull generality.That last pass is 8.05.So let me give\nyou some examples.Let me just draw some\ncharacteristic wave functions.And these are going to turn\nout to be useful for us.So for example, consider\nthe following function.So here is 0 and we're\nplotting as a function of x.And then plotting the\nreal part of psi of x.So first consider a very\nnarrowly supported function.It's basically 0\neverywhere, except ithas some particular spot\nat what I'll call x1.Here's another\nwave function-- 0.It's basically 0 except for\nsome special spot at x2.And again, I'm plotting\nthe real part of psi.And I'm plotting\nthe real part of psibecause A, psi is a complex\nfunction-- at every point itspecifies a complex number.And B, I can't draw\ncomplex numbers.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1},

assumethat the imaginary part is 0.I'm just going to\ndraw the real parts.So let me draw a\ncouple more examples.What else could be a\ngood wave function?Well, those are fine.What about-- again, we want\na function of x and I'mgoing to draw the real part.And another one.So this is going to be a\nperfectly good wave function.And let me draw two more.So what else could be a\nreasonable wave function?Well-- this is harder\nthan you'd think.Oh, God.OK, so that could be the\nwave function, I don't know.That is actually my signature.My wife calls it a\nlittle [INAUDIBLE].OK, so here's the deal.Psi is a complex function.Psi also needs to not\nbe a stupid function.OK so you have to ask me--\nlook, could it be any function?Any arbitrary function?So this is going\nto be a job for us.We're

reasonable function.Reasonable.That's a little weird,\nbut it's not horrible.That's stupid.So we're going to\nhave to come upwith a good definition\nof what not stupid means.So fine, these\nare all functions.One of them is multivalued and\nthat looks a little worrying,but they're all functions.So here's the problem.What does it mean?So postulate 2-- The\nmeaning of the wave functionis that the probability\nthat upon measurementthe object is found\nat the position xis equal to the norm\nsquared of psi of x.If you know the system is\nascribed to the wave functionpsi, and you want\nto look at point x,you want to know with\nwhat probability will Ifind the particle there,\nthe answer is psi squared.Notice that this is a complex\nnumber, but absolute valuesquared, or norm squared,\nof a complex numberis always a real,\nnon-negative number.And that's important because\nwe want our probabilitiesto be real,\nnon-negative numbers.Could be 0, right?Could be 0 chance of something.Can't be negative 7 chance.Incidentally, there also\ncan't be probability 2.So that means that the\ntotal probability had betterbe normalized.So let me just say this\nin words, though, first.So P, which is the\nnorm squared of psi,determines the probability--\nand, in particular,the probability density--\nthat the object in state psi,in the state given by the\nwave function psi of x,will be found at x.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.173}, {"text": "So there's the second postulate.So in particular, when\nI say it's a probabilitydensity, what I mean is the\nprobability that it is foundbetween the position\nx and x plus dxis equal to P of x dx, which is\nequal to psi of x squared dx.Does that make sense?So the probability\nthat it's foundin this infinitesimal\ninterval isequal to this density\ntimes dx or psi squared dx.Now again, it's crucial\nthat the wave functionis in fact properly normalized.Because if I say, look,\nsomething could either be hereor it could be\nhere, what's the sumof the probability\nthat it's hereplus the probability\nthat it's here?It had better be 1, or there's\nsome other possibility.So probabilities\nhave to sum to 1.Total probability that you find\nsomething somewhere must be 1.So what that tells you is\nthat total probability, whichis equal to the integral over\nall possible values of x-- soif I sum over all possible\nvalues of P of x--all values-- should\nbe equal to 1.And we can write\nthis as integral dxover all values of x.And I write \"all\" here rather\nthan putting minus infinityto infinity because some\nsystems will be definedfrom 1 to minus 1, some systems\nwill be defined from minusinfinity to infinity-- all\njust means integrate overall possible values-- hold\non one sec-- of psi squared.AUDIENCE: Are you going\nto use different notationfor probability density\nthan probability?PROFESSOR: I'm not going to.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Probability density is going\nto have just one argument,and total probability\nis going to havean interval as an argument.So they're distinct and this\nis just the notation I like.Other questions?Just as a side note,\nwhat are the dimensionsof the wave function?So everyone think about\nthis one for second.What are the dimensions?AUDIENCE: Is it 1 over\nsquare root lengthPROFESSOR: Awesome.Yes.It's 1 over root length.The dimensions of psi\nare 1 over root length.And the way to see that is\nthat this should be equal to 1.It's a total probability.This is an infinitesimal\nlength, so thishas dimensions of length.This has no dimension, so\nthis must have dimensions of 1over length.And so psi itself of x most have\ndimensions of 1 over length.Now, something I\nwant to emphasize,I'm going to emphasize,\nover and over in this classis dimensional analysis.You need to become comfortable\nwith dimensional analysis.It's absolutely essential.It's essential for two reasons.First off, it's\nessential because I'mgoing to be merciless\nin taking off pointsif you do write down a\ndimensionally false thing.If you write down something on\na problem set or an exam that'slike, a length is equal to\na velocity-- ooh, not good.But the second thing\nis, forget the factthat I'm going to\ntake off points.Dimensional analysis is an\nincredibly powerful toolfor you.You can check something\nthat you've just calculatedand, better yet,\nsometimes you can justavoid a calculation entirely\nby doing a dimensional analysisand seeing that there's only one\npossible way to build somethingof dimensions length\nin your system.So we'll do that\nover and over again.But this is a question\nI want you guys to startasking yourselves at\nevery step along the wayof a calculation-- what\nare the dimensions of all", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "the objects in my system?Something smells like smoke.So with that said, if that's the\nmeaning of the wave function,what physically can we take\naway from knowing these wavefunctions?Well, if this is\nthe wave function,let's draw the\nprobability distribution.What's the probability\ndistribution?P of x.And the probability distribution\nhere is really very simple.It's again 0 squared is\nstill 0 so it's stilljust a big spike at x1 and\nthis one is a big spike at x2.Everyone cool with that?So what do you know\nwhen I tell youthat this is the wave function\ndescribing your system?You know that with\ngreat confidence,you will find the particle to\nbe sitting at x1 if you look.So what this is telling you\nis you expect x is roughly x1and our uncertainty\nin x is small.Everyone cool with that?Similarly, here you see that\nthe position is likely to be x2,and your uncertainty\nin your measurement--your confidence\nin your predictionis another way to say\nit-- is quite good,so your uncertainty is small.Now what about these guys?Well, now it's norm squared.I need to tell you what\nthe wave function is.Here, the wave\nfunction that I want--so here is 0-- is\ne to the i k1 x.And here the wave function\nis equal to e to the i k2 x.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And remember, I'm\ndrawing the real partbecause of practical\nlimitations.So the real part is just\na sinusoid-- or, in fact,the cosine-- and similarly,\nhere, the real partis a cosine.And I really should put 0\nin the appropriate place,but-- that worked out well.So now the question is, what's\nthe probability distribution,P of x, associated to\nthese wave functions?So what's the norm squared\nof minus e to the i k1 x?If I have a complex number\nof phase e to the i alpha,and I take its norm\nsquared, what do I get?1.Right?But remember complex numbers.If we have a complex\nnumber alpha-- or sorry,if we have a\ncomplex number beta,then beta squared\nis by definitionbeta complex\nconjugate times beta.So e to the i alpha, if\nthe complex conjugateis e to the minus i alpha,\ne to the i alpha timese to the minus i alpha,\nthey cancel out-- that's 1.So if this is the\nwave function, what'sthe probability distribution?Well, it's 1.It's independent of x.So from this we've learned\ntwo important things.The first is, this is\nnot properly normalized.That's not so key.But the most important thing is,\nif this is our wave function,and we subsequently measure the\nposition of the particle-- welook at it, we say ah,\nthere's the particle--where are we likely to find it?Yeah, it could be anywhere.So what's the value of x\nyou expect-- typical x?I have no idea, no\ninformation whatsoever.None.But and correspondingly,\nwhat is our uncertaintyin the position of

now what about this guy?What's the probability\ndistribution well nowyou see why this is a\nstupid wave function,because it's multiply valued.It has multiple different\nvalues at every value of x.So what's the probability?Well, it might be root 2,\nmaybe it's 1 over root 3.I'm really not sure.So this tells us an important\nlesson-- this is stupid.And what I mean by stupid\nis, it is multiply valued.So the wave function--\nwe just learneda lesson-- should\nbe single valued.And we will explore some more\non your problem set, whichwill be posted\nimmediately after lecture.There are problems

reasonably definite spot.These two wave\nfunctions, though,look pretty much useless,\nbecause they give usno information whatsoever\nabout what the position is.Everyone agree with that?Except-- remember the\nde Broglie relations.The de Broglie relations say\nthat associated to a particleis also some wave.And the momentum\nof that particleis determined by the wavelength.It's inversely

an important thing, so\nlet me rephrase your questionslightly.So the question\nwas, is delta P 0?Is it really 0?So here's a problem\nfor us right now.We don't have a\ndefinition for delta P.So what is the\ndefinition of delta P?I haven't given you one.So here, when I said\ndelta P is small,what I mean is, intuitively,\njust by eyeball,our confidence in that\nmomentum is pretty good,using the de

so much.So hold that question and wait\nuntil you see the next examplesthat I put on this board,\nand if that doesn't answeryour question, ask\nit again, becayseit's a very important question.OK.AUDIENCE: When you\ntalk about a photon,you always say a photon\nhas a certain frequency.Doesn't that mean that it\nmust be a wave because youhave to fix the wave number k?PROFESSOR:

for now, we're\njust going to have kx.So this is a general plane wave.And what de Broglie\nreally was sayingis that, somehow, associated\nto the particle with energy Eand momentum P should be\nsome wave, a plane wave,with wave number k\nand frequency omega.And that's the wave\nfunction associated to it.The thing is, not every wave\nfunction is a plane wave.Some wave functions\nare well

question.So and alpha and beta\nare some complex numberssubject to the\nnormalization condition.So indeed, this wave function\nshould be properly normalized.Now, let me step\nback for second.There's an alternate way\nto phrase the probabilitydistribution here,\nwhich goes like this,and I'm going to put it here.The alternate statement of\nthe probability distributionis that the

automatically\nproperly normalized.Because this is a constant, when\nwe integrate the top, that'sequal to the bottom,\nit integrates to 1.So I prefer,\npersonally, in thinkingabout this for the first

wave function,\ngives us a correctionto the classical addition\nof probabilities,which is these\ninterference terms.Everyone happy with that?Now, here's something very\nimportant to keep in mind.These things are norms\nsquared of complex numbers.That means they're real,\nbut in particular, they'renon-negative.So these two are both\nreal and non-negative.But what about this?This is not the norm\nsquared of anything.However, this is its\ncomplex conjugate.When you take something\nand its complex conjugateand you add them\ntogether, you getsomething that's\nnecessarily real.But it's not\nnecessarily positive.So this is a funny thing.The probability that something\nhappens if we add togetherour two configurations, we\nsuperpose two configurations,has a positive probability term.But it's also got\nterms that don'thave a definite sign,\nthat could be negative.It's always real.And you can check but\nthis quantity is alwaysgreater than or equal to 0.It's never negative,\nthe total quantity.So remember Bell's inequality\nthat we talked about?Bell's inequality\nsaid, look, if wehave the probability of one\nthing happening being P1,", "start": 2880.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and the probability of\nthe other thing happeningbeing P2, the probability\nof both things happeningis just P1 plus P2.And here we see that,\nin quantum mechanics,probabilities\ndon't add that way.The wave functions add--\nand the probabilityis the norm squared\nof the wave function.The wave functions add,\nnot the probabilities.And that is what underlies all\nof the interference effectswe've seen.And it's going to be the\nheart of the rest of quantummechanics.So you're probably all going,\nin your head, more or lesslike I was when I took\nIntro Quantum, like-- yeah,but I

some informationabout the position\nof the object.It's likely to be here.It is unlikely to be\nhere, likely and unlikely.We now have some\nposition information.We don't have enough\nto say where it is.But x is-- you have\nsome information.Now, our uncertainty\nstill gigantic.Delta x is still huge.But OK, we just added\ntogether two plane waves.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Why is\nthe probability notbig, small, small,\nbig, small, small?PROFESSOR: Excellent.This was the real part\nof the wave function.And the wave function\nis a complex quantity.When you take e to\nthe i k1, and letme do this on the chalkboard.When we take e to the i\nk1 x plus e to the i k2x-- Let me write this\nslightly differently--e to the i a plus e to the i\nb and take its norm squared.So this is equal to--\nI'm going to writethis in a slightly\nmore suggestive way--the norm squared of e to the\ni a times 1 plus e to the i b", "start": 3000.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "minus a parentheses\nnorm squared.So first off, the norm\nsquared of a product of thingsis the product of\nthe norm squareds.So I can do that.And this overall phase, the norm\nsquared of a phase is just 1,so that's just 1.So now we have the norm squared\nof 1 plus a complex number.And so the norm squared of\n1 is going to give me 1.The norm squared of the complex\nnumber is going to give me 1.And the cross terms are going\nto give me the real part--twice the real part--\nof e to the i b minusa, which is going to be\nequal to cosine of b minus a.And so what you see\nhere is that youhave a single frequency\nin the superposition.So good, our\nuncertainty is large.So let's look at\nthis second examplein a little more detail.By superimposing two states with\nwavelength lambda1 and lambda2or k1 and k2 we get\nsomething that, OK,it's still not\nwell localized-- wedon't know where the\nparticle is goingto be-- but it's better\nlocalized than it was before,right?What happens if we superpose\nwith three wavelengths,or four, or more?So for that, I want to pull\nout a Mathematica package.You guys should all have\nseen Fourier analysisin 18.03, but just in case,\nI'm putting on the web page,on the Stellar page, a\nnotebook

time.So I'm not going to go through\nthe details of this package,but what this does is walk\nyou through the superpositionof wave packets.So here I'm looking at the\nprobability distribution comingfrom summing up a\nbunch of plane waveswith some definite frequency.So here it's just one.That's one wave,\nso first we have--let me make this bigger-- yes,\nstupid Mathematica tricks.So here we have\nthe wave functionand here we have the probability\ndistribution, the norm squared.And it's sort of\nbadly normalized here.So that's for a single wave.And as you see, the probability\ndistribution is constant.And that's not 0,\nthat's 0.15, it'sjust that I arbitrarily\nnormalized this.So let's add two plane waves.And now what you see is the\nsame effect as we had here.You see a slightly more\nlocalized wave function.Now you have a little bit of\nstructure in the probabilitydistribution.So there's the structure in\nthe probability distribution.We have a little\nmore informationabout where the particle\nis more likely to be herethan it is to be here.Let's add one more.And as we keep adding\nmore and more plane wavesto our superposition, the wave\nfunction and the probabilitydistribution associated\nwith it become", "start": 3240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "more and more\nwell-localized until, as wego to very high numbers of plane\nwaves

unlikely to\nbe anywhere else.Everyone cool with that?What's the expense?Want have we lost\nin the process?Well we know with\ngreat confidencenow that the particle will be\nfound here upon observation.But what will its momentum be?Yeah, now it's the\nsuperposition of a whole bunchof different momenta.So if it's a superposition\nof a whole bunchof different\nmomenta, here this islike superposition of a whole\nbunch of different positions--likely to be here,\nlikely to be here,likely to be here,\nlikely to be here.What's our knowledge\nof its position?It's not very good.Similarly,

anything\nin that superposition.So now we're seeing\nquite sharplythe uncertainty relation.And here it is.So the uncertainty\nrelation is nowpretty clear from these guys.So that didn't work?And I'm going to leave it alone.This is enough for\nthe Fourier analysis,but that Fourier\npackage is availablewith extensive commentary\non the Stellar web page.AUDIENCE: Now is\nthat sharp definitionin the

leads to\ncertainty in the position.That's exactly right.Yeah.AUDIENCE: So as we're\ncertain of the position,we will not be certain\nof the momentum.PROFESSOR: Exactly.And here we are.So in this

this what we do\nhere's a quick question.How well do you know the\nposition of this particle?Pretty well, right?But how well do you\nknow its momentum?Well, we'd all like to say\nnot very, but tell me why.Why is your uncertainty in the\nmomentum of the particle large?AUDIENCE: Heisenberg's\nuncertainty principle.PROFESSOR: Yeah,\nbut that's a cheatbecause we haven't actually\nproved Heisenberg's uncertaintyprinciple.It's just something\nwe're inheriting.AUDIENCE: I believe it.PROFESSOR: I believe it, too.But I want a better\nargument because Ibelieve all sorts\nof crazy stuff.So-- I really do.Black holes, fluids, I mean\nlook, don't get me started.Yeah.AUDIENCE: You can take the\nFourier transform of it.PROFESSOR: Yeah, excellent.OK, we'll get to\nthat in just one sec.So before taking the\nFourier transform, whichis an excellent--\nso the answer was,just take a Fourier\ntransform, that'sgoing to give you\nsome information.We're going to do\nthat in just a moment.But before we do\nFourier transform,just intuitively, why would\nde Broglie look at thisand say, no, that doesn't\nhave a definite momentum.AUDIENCE: There's\nno clear wavelength.PROFESSOR: Yeah, there's\nno wavelength, right?It's not periodic by any\nstretch of the imagination.It doesn't look like a thing\nwith a definite wavelength.And de Broglie said, look, if\nyou have a definite wavelength", "start":

better\nthan this, we needto introduce the\nFourier transform,and I want to do that now.So you should all have seen\nFourier series in 8.03.Now we're going to do\nthe Fourier transform.And I'm going to\nintroduce this to youin 8.04 conventions\nin the following way.And the theorem\nsays the following--we're not going to prove it by\nany stretch of the imagination,but the theorem\nsays-- any

plane waves of the forme to the ikx.Enough may be infinite.So any function f of x can be\nexpressed as 1 over root 2 pi,and this root 2 pi is a choice\nof normalization-- everyonehas their own\nconventions, and theseare the ones we'll be\nusing in 8.04 throughout--minus infinity to infinity\ndk f tilde of k e to the ikx.So here, what we're\ndoing is, we'resumming over plane waves\nof

arenon-periodic on the real line,\nrather than periodic functionson the interval, which is what\nyou should've seen in 8.03.Now, conveniently, if\nyou know f tilde of k,you can compute f of\nx by doing the sum.But suppose you\nknow f of x and youwant to determine what\nthe coefficients are,the expansion coefficients.That's the inverse\nFourier transform.And the statement for\nthat is that f

Absolutely,\nso, however,what is true about\nFourier series?When you use a discrete\nset of momenta,which are linear, which are--\nIt must be a periodic function,exactly.So here what we've\ndone is, we've said,look, we're writing\nour wave function,our arbitrary wave function,\nas a continuous superpositionof a continuous value\nof possible momenta.This is absolutely correct.This is exactly\nwhat

value\nof P if this is the Fourier", "start": 4320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "transform?Well remember, we have to take\nthe norm squared, and psi of kwas e to the i k x1--\nthe Fourier transform.You will do much\npractice on takingFourier transforms\non the problem set.Where did my eraser go?There it is.Farewell, principle one.So what does norm squared\nof psi tilde look like?Well, just like before,\nthe norm squaredis constant, because the norm\nsquared of a phase is constant.And again, the\nnorm squared-- thisis psi tilde of k norm\nsquared-- we believe,we're conjecturing\nthis is P of k.You will prove this relation\non your problem set.You'll prove that it follow\nfrom what we said before.And similarly, this is\nconstant-- e to the i k x2.So now we have no\nknowledge of the momenta.So that also fits.The momenta is, we have no idea.And uncertainty is large.And the momenta is,\nwe have no idea.And the uncertainty is large.So in all these\ncases, we see that wesatisfy quite nicely the\nuncertainty relation--small position momentum,\nlarge momentum uncertainty.Large position\nuncertainty, we'reallowed to have small\nmomentum uncertainty.And here, it's a little\nmore complicated.We have a little bit of\nknowledge of position,and we have a little bit of\nknowledge of the momenta.We have a little bit of\nknowledge of position,and we have a little bit\nof knowledge of momenta.So we'll walk through\nexamples with superpositionlike this on the problem set.Last questions\nbefore we get going?OK so I have two things\nto do before we're done.The first is, after lecture\nends, I have clickers.And anyone who wants\nto borrow clickers,you're welcome to come\ndown and pick them upon a first come\nfirst served basis.I will start using the\nclickers in the next lecture.", "start": 4440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So if you don't already\nhave one, get one now.But the second thing is--\ndon't get started yet.I have a demo to do.And last time I told\nyou-- this is awesome.It's like I'm an\nexperimentalist for a day.Last time I told you that one of\nthe experimental facts of liceis-- of lice.One of the experimental\nfacts of lice.One of the experimental\nfacts of lifeis that there is\nuncertainty in the worldand that there is probability.There are unlikely\nevents that happenwith some probability,\nsome finite probability.And a good example of the\nrandomness of the real worldinvolves radiation.So hopefully you can hear this.Apparently, I'm not\nvery radioactive.You'd be surprised at the\nthings that are radioactive.Ah, got a little tick.Shh.This is a plate sold at\nan Amish county fair.It's called vaseline ware\nand it's made of local clays.[GEIGER COUNTER CLICKS]It's got uranium in it.ButI want to emphasize-- exactly\nwhen something goes click,it sounds pretty random.And it's actually a better\nrandom number generatorthan anything you'll find in\nMathematica or C. In fact,for some purposes, the decay\nof radioactive isotopesis used as the perfect\nrandom number generator.Because it really is totally\nrandom, as far as anyonecan tell.But here's my favorite.People used to eat off these.[MUCH LOUDER, DENSER CLICKS]See you next time.", "start": 4560.0, "heat": 0.1}]
