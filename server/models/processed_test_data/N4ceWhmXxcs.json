[{"text": "GILBERT STRANG: OK, I\nthought I would talktoday about power series.These are powers of x.I'm going to keep going.All powers, all those x to the\nfourth, x to the fifth,they'll all come in too.And my idea is combine them,\nadd them up to geta function of x.So we're doing calculus, but a\nnew part of it, with theseinfinite series.So what do I mean\nby combine them?I mean I'll multiply those\npowers by some numbers.Let me call those numbers a0.So this first guy will be\nan a0, and then I'lladd on an a1 x.I'm out of x.I'll add on some a2 x squared,\nsome a3 x cubed and onwards.So now I have a function.And that function, let\nme call it f of x.So here's my starting\nplan here.Well, we've seen this\nfor e to the x.Let me remember how e to the x\ncould come, the series forthat particular function.So here's the plan.I'm going to choose those\na's so as to match--let me put these words down.I'll match at x equals 0.The function, its derivative,\nits next derivative, its thirdderivative, and onwards.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.356}, {"text": "Each a, like a3, will be chosen\nso that that right-handside has the correct derivative,\nthird derivative,at x equals 0.So this Taylor series--Taylor's name is associated\nwith series like this--everything's happening\nat x equals 0.So in the case of e\nto the x, all itsderivatives were the same.Still e to the x.And they all equal\n1 at x equals 0.So I want that function\nto give me 1 for everyderivative.That doesn't mean that the\na's should all be 1.Why not?Because when I take the\nderivative, for example, ofthis guy, that x cubed,\nthe firstderivative, will be 3x squared.The next derivative 6x.The next derivative 6.That's the one I want.That third derivative, but it'll\nbe 6 so a3 will have tobe 1/6 to give me the\ncorrect answer 1.Let me write those\nthings down.So what we just did is the\nderivative of x to the n-th.The n-th derivative.What's the n-th derivative\nof x to the n?We get to use our nice formula\nfor derivatives.So the first derivative is\nnx to the n minus 1.The derivative of that will be\nn times n minus 1 x to onelower power.Keep going, do it n times,\nand what have you got?You

written n with\nan exclamation mark.So that's n factorial and that's\nthe n-th derivative ofx to the n.So for the particular function\ne to the x, if I worked outits series, all the derivatives\nI'm trying to getare all 1's.But what the powers of x gives\nme these n factorials.The a's had better divide\nby the n factorial.So let me recall the series for\ne to the x, and then goonto new functions.That's the point\nof my lecture.So we're getting e to the x in\na slightly different way fromthe original way, but\nthis is a good way.e to the x at x equals 0 is 1.At the first derivative of e to\nthe x is 1, so I divide by1 factorial.That's 1.But here I have to divide by 2\nbecause the second derivativeis 2 and I want those\nto cancel.And here I divide by--what do I divide by?6
