McKenzie tiger team style.For that, I reward you\nwith doughnuts and coffeeover there.I understand many of you\nwere up late last night,so you're welcome to ingest\nsome shortchange carbohydratesand some caffeine.If you would like to\nget some, get it now.We're going to have another\nminute of blah, blah, blahbefore we dive into\nthe presentationsand the real fun begins.I'd like to introduce\nour panelists up herein the front who will be\nthe evaluation criteriaa la American Idol style,\nexcept that you're, of course,a lot smarter and\nequally well dressed.Starting from right\nto left in front of mewe have Dr. Jasmin Hofstetter,\nwho comes from IES, Spain.That's the Institute for\nSolar Energy in Spain.That's where she did her\nPhD with Antonio Luque.Those who have been studying\nintermediate band solar cellmaterials may know\nthe name as oneof the fathers of the field.She studied under Antonio\nLuque's organizationwith Carlos de Canizo and is the\nwinner of

and a half.PROFESSOR: Three\nand a half years--focused on intermediate\nband solar cell materials,coming from a very broad\nbackground in energyfrom climate science.So with that, I'd like to\nwelcome our first team down,and the floor is yours.STUDENT 1: Good morning, we are\nthe PV smart retrofit group,and our project goal was\nto assess whether or notthe there was an\nelectrical benefitor loss from retrofitting an\nold home with a PV system.Now, in less lofty terms,\nit essentially meansfrom an on site\nenergy perspective,does it make sense to put\nPV panels on my house?You'd think that that's a\nkind of an obvious question.We'd all say, well, yeah.We produce energy for\nfree, except that youhave to consider other\nthings, such as shadingfrom trees that you'd\nhave to cut downor the color of the roof\nthat you might be changingby adding a black panel.These would both reduce the\nthermal load of your housein normal situation.So by adding a PV panel and\nincreasing the thermal load,you actually add the\nenergy to cool your houseduring the summer.We considered multiple\nvariables in this project.One was location, which\nhas an effect on the amountof sunlight you're receiving.The PV panel's\npresence and its size.We had a couple of\nsituations where", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.131}, {"text": "there was no panel as\na kind of a baseline.And then also different sizes\nto figure out if a biggerpanel had a bigger effect.We looked at two different\ncolors, black and white.Those are the ends\nof the spectrum,and they give us\nendpoints to look at,and the color matters\nbecause a darkercolor will absorb more heat.We looked at roof pitch.The reason for this--\nwell, first off, roof pitchis the angle of your roof.And we looked at this because\nwe assumed that our panels werefixed and parallel to\nthe roof, so this kindof controlled what\nangle your solar panelwas facing towards the sun.And finally you had\nyour house footprint,which is the area\nthat the house covers,and when you combine\nthat with the roof pitch,you get the area of the\nroof, which is reallywhat we're concerned with.We had five\nscenarios, and as youcan see from our\ncute little diagrams,we have a black\nroof, a white roof,a white roof with the tree, a\nwhite roof with a solar panel,and a white roof with a\nsolar panel and a cut treeso the solar panel is\ngetting plenty of sunlight.In evaluating the\nfive scenarios,we had three models of\nincreasing complexity from leftto right, which you\ncan note from the factthat model one only\ncovers three of the five,and these models all\nhad common assumptions.The first was that\nyou had a single storyhouse in a suburban\nlocations, so youdidn't have shading from\nother buildings, for example.We had a common house size of\nabout 2000 square feet, or 186square meters.The roof pitch,\nwhich in constructionis set usually at 5/12,\nwhich means 5 inches of risefor 12 inches of travel.We had an unfinished\nattic space,which means that it's\nsealed to the outside,but you didn't make it\nlivable, a five kilowatt PVsystem covering\n36 square meters,and we chose reflectance values\nof 0.08 for black and 0.35", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.106}, {"text": "for white, and this, again,\nreflects the effect that colorhas on heat absorption.With that, I will turn\nyou over to, Jordan.JORDAN: So the first\none that we looked atwas basically using\nmost readily availableand simple models there can be.So this is from the\nDepartment of Energyto measure-- well,\nto get a gauge of howthe color of the roof\nand the roof propertiesaffect the thermal\nloads in the house.This is a simple one\ndimensional modelwhere you've got an inside\ncavity of 65 Fahrenheit,and you basically\ninput the location,and from that it has a lookup\ntable of the average insulationon the house, as well as the\nnumber of heating degree daysand cooling degree days relative\nto that 65 inside temperature.The other parameters\nare just at the roof,so we insert the\nreflectance, and we'reusing values that represent\nreal tiles for an average house,black and white, as well as the\nthermal resistance and the heatabsorbance of the tiles--\nfrom this model, the outputsand the thermal loads\nin terms of the heatingyou need to put in, as well\nas the cooling energy load.So with the thermal\nmodel assessed,we can assess the\nphotovoltaic output.And for this, we're just\nusing a simple model PVWatts.This basically takes in\nthe location and the angleof the panels, as well\nas a derate factorfrom converting to AC to DC.It's quite a simple model,\nand output from thisis the amount of\nkilowatt hours per yearthat you get from the panels.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.137}, {"text": "STUDENT 2: So I'll be talking\nabout a couple thermal electricmodel.This is the model that\nwe built in our group,and we developed\nthis model basedon two sets of\nindividual parametersand individual models.I would say that one comprises\nof the thermal model,and there is the electric model.So what we need to note\nfrom this model hereis it's a further\nstep in complexitywhen compared to the module\none that Jordan just discussed.And it takes into account\nvarious input parametersthat the model one\ndoesn't take into account.So the basic structure of\nthis model is as follows.We have a thermal model\nwhich takes into accountseveral input conditions, such\nas the insulation and shading,and it outputs a living\nspace temperature,which is this temperature of\nthe living room in our house.And then this temperature is fed\ninto an electric model, whichcalculates the cost\nand energy values,and thus we can compare an\nenergy production and energyconsumption.Going to the thermal\nmodel in detail,I've just shown a picture here.So it considers\nbasically when westart from the top of the house,\nwe use insulation and shadingas the input parameters.We then calculate the\ntemperature of the PV panel,and then the\ntemperature of the roofusing two different\nenergy balance models.And these two energy\nbalance modelsare pretty robust in the\nsense that they considerall these physical phenomenon\nwhich are realistic,such as the\nconvection, radiation,and PV electrical output.And based on these\nenergy balance equations,we can calculate the PV\npanel temperature and thenthe roof temperature.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "And once we get these\ntwo temperatures,we get the heat flux\nthat goes into the roofand that enters the attic.And once you get\nthis, we find outthe attic temperature,\nwhich then determines whatis the ceiling temperature.And then we consider the\nconvection via ceiling,and then finally we end up with\nthe living space temperature.And then the couple this\nliving space temperaturewith another electric model,\nwhich I'll discuss now.So the electric model is\nbasically based on an ideal gasassumption.So it basically--\nwhat it does isit calculates the energy\nneeded by the AC, whichcould be the heating\nor cooling, in orderto maintain the living space\nat a particular temperature.And we use this formula,\nm dot Cp delta T,which is an ideal\ngas formula, whichgives out the energy\nneeded by the cooler.And then so the electrical model\nuses the power consumption,and then we know the power\nproduction through PV output.So comparing these\ntwo, we can reallyassess whether PV installation\nis favorable or not.And this is just\nthe model in making.What we want to signify\nhere is we actuallymade this model on\nour own, and thisis the MATLAB code we wrote.And the model not only just\npredicts energy values,but it also can do\na lot more things,such as predicting temperature.And what I've shown\nhere is the PV output,and then the cooling\nload that is required,so it can do a lot of\nother things, as well.This is the\ntemperature of the roofin terms of direct sunlight\nand diffuse sunlight.So if anyone is\ninterested, I'd behappy to discuss with them more.Thank you.And I'll now pass\nit on to Heidi.HEIDI: So I take over\nfrom here talkingabout the third and most\ncomplex model that we used.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.499}, {"text": "For this model, we used\ntwo different softwares--one called BEopt from\nNREL, and the second,called EnergyPlus,\nwhich you'll see later,developed by the\nDepartment of Energy.So what we did in this model\nwas we took into accountthe 3D effects of these\nthermal and electric loadsthat have been talked about\nin the other two models.The first thing we did was to\nactually model the 3D house,as you can see right over here.BEopt allows for a very nice\ninterface, where you can easilymodel the house and easily\nand put a whole bunch of inputparameters for the house.And for these input\nparameters, weconsulted with an experienced\nbuilding inspectorfor the construction inputs\nand used BEopt default valuesfor the rest of the inputs.Once this model of\nthe house was done,we had to actually\nexport it into EnergyPlusbecause EnergyPlus gives us\na much more detailed lookinto all these different\nparameters, I guess.And you can actually go in\nand modify different things.For the materials, we can\nmodify every single materialproperty-- conductivity,\ndensity, specific heat--and we actually did\nthat for the roof.And we also removed\na whole bunchof other miscellaneous loads\nthat BEopt had included.So this is how we modeled\nthe trees and the panelsthat we talked about in\nour scenarios before.For the trees, we modelled\nthem as these really large 5by 20 meter rectangles that\nact as shading for the house.So the trees are located on\nthe south side of the house,and we modelled them\nas deciduous trees,so we set up a transmitting\nschedule so that theyhave a higher transmittance in\nthe winter when the leaves havefallen and a low\none in the summer.And for the case of scenario\nE in which the trees are cut,we modelled the trees as\nbeing five meters tall.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.174}, {"text": "On the other hand,\nfor the PV panel,we modeled it as being\nfixed on the roof.We actually had to completely\nchange the model from BEopt,because they modeled\nit as being decoupledfrom the entire system, placed\n30 meters away from the house.So we completely changed\nthat, and we read extensivelyinto EnergyPlus literature and\nfound this particular object--I guess you could call\nit-- called the integratedexterior vented cavity object.And what this does is it\nmodels a surface as being,in our case, 0.5 meters\naway from the roof,and it models the convection\nand radiation between these twosurfaces.We also considered\nthe solar panelto have a solar\nabsorbance of 0.92and thermal emissivity of 0.9.STUDENT 3: And so\nwe actually gota lot of results, as\nyou might imagine,from all those different\nmodels, but justfor the purposes of comparison\nfor the presentation,we're just going to show\nyou-- just summarize results.And basically what we're\nshowing you here is specificallyfor Boston, and this\nfigure that we're showingis the y-axis is the\nrelative energy gain.So in order to compare them,\nwe decided within each modelcompare it to a\ncommon situation.So we decided to say\nthat, if we're in Boston,let's say we start with\na white roof and a tree,so that's scenario C there,\nso that's why it's 0.So everything is in\ncomparison to that.And right off, we could see\nthat, as we might expect,putting a PV on makes\nsense energetically.And specifically\nscenario D, whichis where you completely remove\nthe tree instead of justcutting it, in Boston at least,\nis what makes the most sense.And this is for both\nmodels-- actually,", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.168}, {"text": "for all the models-- although\nmodel one can't reallymodel a tree necessarily.So that's why it basically\ndoesn't apply for that.In terms of comparing the\nresults between the models,model one actually does a\npretty decent job in Bostonin getting close to model\nthree, which is impressive,because model one is\nsignificantly more crude, muchsimpler than model three, which\nrequired many, many inputs.And the reason we believe the\ndiscrepancy is between modelstwo and three is that\nmodel two-- the waythat we basically treated the\nsolar insulation-- it doesn'ttreat diffuse\nsunlight differently,whereas basically the models\nPVWatts and EnergyPlus willtake all that into\naccount, so wethink that's a larger\nreason for that.And then similar\nthing in Phoenix.And basically we see a\nslightly different case here.Actually scenario E, where\nyou just-- you install the PV,but you cut the tree\ninstead of completelyremoving it-- gives you a\nslightly better increasein net energy gain.In terms of-- and\nthis is, again,just in terms of energies.There could be rounding errors.This is ignoring the fact\nthat, if you cut a tree down,the net greenhouse gas emissions\nwould be changed and altered,and this is ignoring\nall those other effects.This is just in terms of net\nenergy gain of the house.And just to point out the\ndiscrepancy between model onehere, we think that model\none is actually, again--that's using PVWatts to\nget your energy output.And that's basically assuming\npeak solar insulation,whereas our models basically\nuse more empirical formulasto get the estimates\nfor your PV output.And then the last thing we\ndid to do the sensitivity--", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.132}, {"text": "or to compare the models, was do\na sort of sensitivity analysis.So basically on\nyour y-axis, whatyou have is your percent change\nin your relative energy gain--relative, again, to\nthat scenario C--divided by the percent\nchange in your parameters.So we just considered\nfour parameters.The x-axis is a rough\nestimate of how difficultit would be to actually change\nthat parameter in your house.So the far left\none is the PV size.We just assumed if you went--\ninstead of a five kilowattto a 5.5 kilowatt, so that's\nwhy the price is roughly $3,000.We assumed about a $5 to $6\nper watt installation costfor that.So that's basically\nthe easiest one to do,and you get various significant\nchange in your thermal energygains because of that.And then just\nbecause of time I'mgoing to rush through these, but\nbasically a lot of the modelsfollow similar trends in\nterms of the sensitivities.The last one is the roof pitch.You obviously wouldn't\nreally want to change that.It's very expensive to do.Luckily, for most\nof the models, it'snot actually that\nsensitive to it,at least within a close amount\nto where you start with.So in conclusion,\nin all three models,it makes sense to\ninstall a PV system.It's kind of what we\nexpected from the beginning,but it's nice to get\nthat sort of conclusion.For models one and\ntwo, we actuallywere able to get pretty\nreasonable results,but they're limited in\nterms of what you canconsider within those models.The advantage of looking\nat this basicallyis that, if you have\na user that isn'tas familiar with EnergyPlus\nin model three, whichis very sophisticated-- it\nrequires a lot of inputs--they can still get a\nrough estimate, whichis relatively close, using\nthese much simpler models.And model three--\nagain, we were takingthat to be the more\nrealistic case,but you'd have to compare\nit to real life dataand do an empirical analysis\nto see how close it actuallydoes correlate.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.458}, {"text": "And then just,\nagain, to summarizethe results we got from\nmodel three-- in Boston,it makes sense to\ninstall the PV,but completely remove the tree.And your payback period\nis about 24 years.In Phoenix, the best scenario\nis to install the PV,cut the tree, and\nit's about 51 years.And interestingly, the maximum\nof that relative energy gainwas essentially\nthe same in both,even though the\nscenarios were different.So we'd just like to\nacknowledge Professor Buonassisifor helping assist\nus and guidingthe direction of the project,\nand Bryan Urban at Fraunhoferand other members at Fraunhofer\nfor giving us guidance.And with that, we would like\nto ask you for questions.[APPLAUSE]AUDIENCE: My\nquestion is I grew upin a neighborhood that\nhas a lot of trees,and so cutting\ndown all the treeswouldn't be very practical,\nbut do you at all considerPV systems that\ncould handle shadingat different times of the day?So somehow decoupling\ndifferent partsof it knowing that some of them\nwill be in sunlight for partof the day, some of them will\nbe shaded, and that will change?STUDENT 3: So you could\nmake the model-- especiallyin EnergyPlus, you could make\nit as complex as you want.We just did this for simplicity,\njust to put boundariesaround what are problem is\nthat we were considering,but you could definitely-- yeah,\nyou could definitely add thatto the model if you wanted to.STUDENT 1: Cutting\nthe tree was notworrying about the output of\nthe actual cell in terms ofwhether or not some shading\nwas going to bring downthe rest of the cell.The reason we\nwould cut the treesis to increase the maximum\namount of sunlight per dayhitting the panel.And it's because we were looking\nmostly at endpoints, tryingto get the spectrum ends.That was why we went\nto such extremes.Cutting down selective trees\nand just parts of treeswould be kind of in between.It's a little bit more\ndifficult to assess.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.219}, {"text": "STUDENT 2: Cutting down trees\nis actually [INAUDIBLE].It's not [INAUDIBLE] because\nwe found that the shadingfactor doesn't play a much\nbigger role if you lookat the relative [INAUDIBLE].So you would as\nwell have increasedthe-- there will be objectively\nsmall loss in the energy gain,but that shouldn't matter much.AUDIENCE: Sort of a\nphilosophical question.If the payback period in Phoenix\nis 51 years, is it worth it?That's a long time period\nfor-- I guess economicallyyou could say that you could do\nother things with that capitalinstead that would have\na shorter payback period.JORDAN: Well, 51\nyears-- then the answeris probably not if you're\nlooking at the benefit of costmoney-wise.We did analysis\nabout the energy.So we found an estimate for the\nembedded energy of the panel.This is from-- I can't\nremember the source,but they change quite a bit.But this example says it's\n1,500 kilowatt hours per metersquared, so that equivalents\nto nine years payback.Pretty much nine\nyears in Boston.I think it turned out to\nbe eight years in Phoenix.So there is a\nbenefit energy-wise,but in this example,\nperhaps not cost-wise--perhaps not the most\nadvantageous to do per dollar.MARK WINKLER: A related\nquestion, actually.Can you back to your\ntwo slides back maybe?JORDAN: Yeah.MARK WINKLER: Your look\nat the net energy gainwas quite similar.So why the large difference\nin yearly savingsand payback period.STUDENT 3: Just the cost of\nelectricity in each location.We estimated it as about $0.07\nper kilowatt hour in Phoenixand $0.17 in Boston\nfor residential.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "STUDENT 1: Which is why you\nwould get a shorter paybackperiod for Boston-- is because\nthe cost of the electricitythat you're [INAUDIBLE].MARK WINKLER: So I would have\nassumed that the generationmix is sort of similar.Is that regulatory,\nor-- I would assumethey're coal/gas centric\ngeneration mixes.STUDENT 3: Yeah.You mean in terms of\nhow the houses are--MARK WINKLER: This is a\nlittle outside the scopeof what you guys did.I was just curious\nif you guys hadany sense of why\nthe big differencein wholesale electricity\nprice is between Boston--STUDENT 3: I think part of it\nis just how plentiful energy is.I guess Boston is at the very\nend in the corner of the US.It's more difficult to get fuel,\noil, gas shipped over here.I think Arizona--\nI think they'rerelatively close to a nuclear\npower plant over there.Oil-- I think it's\njust location--wise.JOE SULLIVAN: There's\na lot of coal there.They actually ship a\nlot of the electricityto California because they\ncan't [INAUDIBLE] in California.One quick question, though.The relative energy gains\nare the same for both.Do you have different\nsized panels,or is heating that much?That's a big deal.STUDENT 3: Heating, yeah.JOE SULLIVAN: OK.So if you--HEIDI: Also for Phoenix.For Phoenix, you can see\nthis is the cooling over hereand heating on the\nright over there,and for Phoenix, you can\njust look at the valuesand see that there's a lot more\ncooling than heating comparedto the Boston case, where\nthere's a lot more heatingby many orders of\nmagnitude more.And so that kind\nof balances it out.JOE SULLIVAN: And so that's\nonly in a cutting downa tree case if you were already\nwell shaded or not shadedat all?HEIDI: These are\nactually all the curvesfor all the scenarios, and--JOE SULLIVAN: I see.OK.HEIDI: So it does matter\njust because of location.So if you're not\ncutting down a tree,", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.377}, {"text": "then there's no\ndecrease in shading.Or is it just the panel\nitself that's heating up more?STUDENT 3: Well, actually\nif you go back to--JOE SULLIVAN: Sorry, I\nthink I missed something.STUDENT 3: Actually,\nin Boston it actuallymakes more sense to have a\nblack roof than a white roof.So you actually want--\nshading isn't necessarilygood in Boston, just because\nthere's so much heatingthat you need in the winter.It seems to be the\ndominant effect in Boston,and in Phoenix,\nit's the opposite.The cooling is the\ndominant effect.PROFESSOR: Did you\nconsider the possibilitythat snow also\ninsulates the houseonce it falls on the roof?STUDENT 3: No.We did not.I don't know if-- is\nthat built into-- Idon't know what would happen.No, I don't think we did,\nbut that's a good point.AUDIENCE: Along\nthose lines, do youhave any intuition\nas to why in one caseit's better to cut down a\ntree other than remove it,and then the other is better to\nremove it rather than just cutit down?Are you expecting it\nto grow back and thenhave to incur more\ncosts because you'regoing to have to cut it down\nagain, or-- what's going on?STUDENT 3: Well, just\nin terms of pure energy,it was very, very\nslightly betterin this case to have\nthe tree just cutjust in terms of the balance\nbetween heating and cooling[INAUDIBLE].STUDENT 1: I may be able\nto help clarify that.The idea is in Boston\nwe're relatively cold mostof the year, so the more\nsunlight that hits your houseis going to add more\nheat to your house,and that's less energy\nthat you have to pay for.So the reason that it's\nbeneficial to cut downthe tree completely in Boston is\nbecause it allows more sunlightto hit your house, whereas\nin Phoenix, you don't wantthe sunlight to hit your house.If you cut down the\ntree completely,that's more you have to\npay for AC in the summer.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.302}, {"text": "So the--AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the\ndifference between cutting downthe tree and removing it?STUDENT 1: So--STUDENT 3: So-- go ahead.STUDENT 1: Cutting\nthe tree is assumingthat you're going to maintain\nit at that certain level.So by cutting the tree,\nyou keep a certain amountof shading on the lower\npart of your house,but you still allow sunlight\nto hit your solar panel.Cutting down the\ntree completely meansthere's no shading\non your house at all.AUDIENCE: I guess I have\na philosophical question.So I think there are\na lot of people--motivation for the solar panels\nis not just the [INAUDIBLE],but rather the desire\nto do somethinggood for the\nenvironment, and to lowercarbon emissions, et cetera.But when you cut down trees,\nthat increases your carbonemission because you're\nreducing the plant,that reduces your carbon output.So given that you won't have a\ntree there for like 50 years,does that offset the\ncarbon emission gainsthat you get by--STUDENT 1: Just my two cents.If you really want\nto go in depth,you can look at\nhow much carbon isgoing to be produced\nby the coal power plantto give you the energy that\nyou're going to be using for 50years and compare that\nto the amount of carbonthat one tree was going to save\nyou, or you could ask yourself,am I planning to have a child\nduring those 50 years, whichwill produce so much more CO2\nthan that tree will take out?Either way, it's\nrelatively a small value.However, we do\nacknowledge that therewas a lot of\nphilosophical questionsthat we argued\namongst ourselves,but we realized we didn't have\nthe time to try to evaluate,or the materials, and scope.PROFESSOR: One more\nquestion, and then we'regoing to have to switch groups.Jasmin?JASMIN HOFSTETTER: Do\nyou have

predictableand can be planned for.When we define or talk\nabout intermittency,it's the short-term\nunpredictable effectsthat change the power\noutput significantly.So what we have here is\nthe fractional changein power output over\nthe course of one day.So as you can see, between\nthe two consecutive seconds,the power output\ncan almost double,and it can at other\ntimes drop by half.So from a system\noperator perspective,that's obviously\na major challengebecause demand should\nmatch supply at all times.So again, these effects, or\nthese intermittency issues,arise due to regional weather\npatterns that can be predictedand also due to local\nweather patterns thatare less predictable.So in our project, what\nwe tried to address is,can the weather report be\nused to predict the poweroutput from an ensemble\nof smaller distributive PVsystems?That is, can we average out\nthese local less predictable", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "intermittency effects?I'll give it to Mary to\ndiscuss our approach.MARY: So our goal\nof this projectwas to design a model\nthat could quantitativelyanalyze a PV grid and determine\nits robustness in termsof variability.And our main components were\nmeantime between failure--which is the average\ntime between two systemfailures, which Rita\nwill define and discusslater-- number of\nsystems in the grid,and geographic\ndispersion, which wemeasured through\ngeometric mean distance.Our data set was from\nthe Oahu airport,which is part of the National\nRenewable Energy Laboratory.There are 17 systems all\nwithin about a kilometerof each other, so it's a very\nsmall, very dense system,but there was second interval\ndata for a year, which we used.So there's a fair amount\nof data to give usan estimate of how\nintermittency variesover the course of a system\nand the number of systemsand density.RITA: So our first\nstep was to definewhat was a PV system failure.In order to do so, we\naccessed the CAISO website--that is, the California\nIndependent System Operator--and we took that data from\none week of the actual demandand hour hand demand forecast.They give this value\nfor every hour,so we took the value for\nevery hour of the week,and then we plotted\nin this graph", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.149}, {"text": "that we have a line for\neach day of the week,and can see that both the\nmagnitudes and the shapesthroughout the week\nare almost the same.We can also see that the\nvalues are almost all positive.This means that they\nusually underestimate.They usually think\nthat the demandis going to be under\nwhat it really happens.And so what we defined was\nthat, if this estimation isOK for CAISO, if\nthey can manage thatthe grid with this\nvariation, then theycould also manage the grid with\nthis variation in a PV output.And so we looked at 5:00 PM.That is the hour that\nwe have the biggestvariation between the two,\nand we averaged the value,and we got to 6%.So this means that, if our\nintermittency is above 6%,we are going to have\na PV system failure.If the variation is below\n6%, then the intermittencyis not going to be a failure.Then we could define the\nmean time between failures--that is, the mean time between\ntwo intermittencies higherthan 6%.JARED: OK, now that we\nhave some context of whatthe problem is, and we have an\nidea of what variability is,and we have a data\nset to work with,I'm going to talk about how\nwe actually solve the problem.We use coding in MATLAB to\nhandle this huge data set.NREL had 17 systems out\nthere for every secondof an entire year.And so we took all\nthe files from NRELand put them all\ninto one huge matrix.You can imagine it\nwas-- it ended upbeing about 23 fields\nby several million,and it's about 677 megabytes.So actually handling the\ndata was an issue in itself.", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.502}, {"text": "I don't recommend it\nwith an old computer.And we also the GPS\ncoordinates for eachof those locations\nand the variabilityfrom the California\nISO, so with that datawe could begin to build\nour code to figure outa quantitative description\nof mean time between failureand our idea of density.So once everything was\nloaded into one big matrixthat we could work\nwith, we moved onto use the GPS coordinates.And of those 17\nsystems, we foundevery single combination\nof 17 choose 2,17 choose 3-- every possible\nway that you could connectthese systems-- and\ncame up with somethinglike 60,000 different\nways of connecting these,and then for each\npossible connection,we had a function\nthat would calculatethis geometric\nmean distance thatwould give you an\nidea of the densityof that particular connection.And so to compare our\nmean time between failurefor these systems while\nholding the density constant,we then searched through\nthose possible combinationsand found this magic\nnumber that kind ofexisted for each of those\npossible combinations of two,of three, or four,\nall the way through.And it kind of lined up\nfor geometric mean distanceof 400 meters.So using that set,\nwe could then go onand see how increasing\nthe number of systemshelped the mean time\nbetween failure.And then for a given set,\nwe ended up using eight.17 choose 8 gave us like 24,000\npossible ways to connect them.We searched through and\nfound varying densitiesfor one set number.Then finally we\nwrote a function thatcalculated the mean time\nbetween failure thatwent through our data\nfrom NREL and said--looked at the fractional\ndifference and said,OK, each time it's about\n6%, that's a failure,", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.216}, {"text": "and then measured that distance,\ntook the average of that,and that was our mean\ntime between failure.And then finally,\nonce we had allthat together, we\ncrunched all the numbers,took a long time on my computer.We were able to plot it together\nand get some very nice trends.One of the great things,\nI think, about our codeis that it was only 525\nlines, and if you've everbuilt a programmer, a\nbig application, that'sreally small.It's very easy just to go in\nand see exactly what's going on.So it's very flexible.We could hand it off\nto another company,to another research group,\nand they go in and adaptit to just about any data set.If you are able to get data in\nCalifornia, or from Germany,or from somewhere else, and\nbring it into our format,it's very easy just to plug\nit in and run the data.Very, very minimal\nchanges within our code.And then you could\nalso build on our codeto look at other problems.So we have the change in the--\nwe have the variability dataas a function of time.We also have the solar\noutput as a function of time.So you could conceivably\ngo in and figure outhow your meantime\nbetween failure changesbased on the time of day and\nchange your critical percentagebased on the time\nof day, and thereare several other problems that\nyou could go, and launch offof our code, and continue on.And if you're interested\nat all, I actuallyput the code of my public space.There's the link there.Check it out.It's pretty cool.And then Ashley is going\nto talk about our results.ASHLEY: Cool, so the first\nthing that we did in orderto try to see the trends in\nthese huge fields of datawas just to plot the data.It was actually a\nmuch bigger taskthan I thought it\nwas going to be.The plot on the left is for\none day's worth of data,and the plot on the right\nis one week's worth of data.", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "The y-axis is power density\nin watts per square meter,and the x-axis is\nthe time in seconds.The blue is all 17 of\nour systems together,and the red is just\nfor one system.So as you would assume,\nthe power output for all 17together is clearly\na lot greaterthan the output from\njust one system,but this give us a sense of\nbeing able to see fluctuationswithin one day, and\nalso were able to seewhen the sun rose, and peaked,\nand also fell each day.And in order to quantify all\nthose different fluctuations,we did the fractional change\nin power density versus time,once again, for one day,\nand then for one week.And red is the one system.Blue is all 17 systems\ntogether, and we can alreadysee just from plotting the\ndata that having all 17systems together does\nstart to average outthe fluctuations of\nindividual systemsby a significant amount.So then Rita earlier\nmentioned that we use 6%as our cut off for failure.We actually went ahead and\ndid 6%, 12%, and 18% justto see how sensitive our\nanalysis was to that thresholdvalue.So here we have\nplotted on the leftthe meantime between failure\nversus the number of systems,and on the right,\nmeantime between failureversus the geometric\nmean distance.I also calculated\nthese values for usinga week's worth of data,\na month's worth of data,and a year's worth of data.So the week would give\nyou more fluctuations,but the year would give you the\nmore long-term overall systembehavior.Relationship between the mean\ntime between failure and numberof systems is quadratic, and\nwe found a linear relationshipbetween the mean time\nbetween failure and the GMD.So this is four 6% cut off.This is for 12% cut off,\nand this is for 18% cut off.And the mean time\nbetween failure", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text":

conclusions\nand answer our question.And so the first thing that we\nnoticed, but we were expecting,is that a big data\nsample should beused if conclusions are going\nto be used as a design tool.As Ashley said, we used for\na week, a month, and a year.And so we know that the\nbigger the data set,it's going to be--\nit's not goingto be influenced by\nabnormal things thatcan happen in a given

between\nfailure and number of systems.Number of systems increased.Mean time between\nfailures also increased.This was also according\nto what we expectedbecause we know that the\npercentage and the total outputis going to be lower.We also saw that the mean time\nbetween failure is very low,even when we can see\nthe 17 systems together,we have about 900\nseconds between failures.This means that\nsome backup systemsshould be used in order\nto take over the loadwhen we have a failure.And so now we're\nrunning conditionsto ask our first question.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text":

minutes.I find that remarkable.Additionally, just-- sorry.Can you repeat what exactly\na failure mode is defined as?Are you looking at 6%\nintermittency varyingfrom second to second?So if you look at the output\nfrom one second to the next,does that change by over 6%?RITA: Mm-hm.JOE SULLIVAN: It wasn't\naverage out over an hour.RITA: No, no.It was second by second.JOE SULLIVAN: You got\nthe 6% from Cal ISO.RITA: We said that if there--\nin a given hour, we measured--let me just--JARED: They only had an\nhour of data [INAUDIBLE].RITA: Yeah, they only\ngave hourly data.So the difference\nbetween the actual demandand the hour-ahead\ndemand forecast.So this is what they are\nexpecting, but the differencebetween what they are expecting\nand what the grid is reallyasking them.So if they can manage this\ndifference on a second base,they can also manage this\ndifference on the PV grid.JOE SULLIVAN: So you\ntook the worst case.Is that how you got 6%?RITA: Yeah, we took the\naverage of the worst case.It's the 5:00 PM.The 5:00 PM is always\nthe worst hour.It's always when\nthey have that peak.And in fact, all of the\nbase-- almost all of the basewere around 6%.Our peak was like 6.8%, and\nwe averaged, and it was 6%.", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.233}, {"text": "MARK WINKLER: So\nthat's essentiallytheir peaking capacity?RITA: Yeah.ASHLEY: Also, so I\nactually wrote downthe numbers for\n6% function, 18%--like our mean time\nbetween failure.For 6%, we had up to 15\nminutes between failure.So it's a pretty low amount\nof time between failures.And if you allow 12%\nas your intermittency,you can get up to\nabout half a day.And then for 18% as your cut\noff, you get about nine days.So it is still\nvery intermittent,and you would pretty often have\nto have backup systems if youhad the small of a system.So if you had a much wider\nspread system and a lot moresystems in your grid,\nthen you could definitelysignificantly increase the\nmean time between failure.Yeah, Joe?JOE SULLIVAN: So you\nhave this awesome graph.So if you go back to\nthe time between failurenumber of systems.The interesting takeaway\nis how large of an areado you have average over, right?So 300 seconds on\na grid perspectiveis unacceptable for\nwidespread PV developed point.We need to be on\nthe order of years.And so do you have an idea\nof what that distance is?ASHLEY: If we just\nextrapolate it out?JOE SULLIVAN: If you\nextrapolate-- this is obviouslylike we're taking the very, very\nedge of that function and thenextrapolating [INAUDIBLE].ASHLEY: So looking\nat the numbers--JOE SULLIVAN: But it looks like\nit's going up exponentially,or do you have an idea\nof what that trend is?ASHLEY: For 6% for\nthe one year, itwas almost exactly x squared.It was like x squared plus\n50, or 100, or whateverthat would be.So if you want, you\ncould say, mean timehow many seconds are in a\nyear equals number squared.So the square root of however\nmany number of secondsthere are in a\nyear would give youyour number of systems required\nfor a year between failures.", "start": 2880.0, "heat": 0.11}, {"text": "IBRAHIM: But this is for a\ngiven geometric mean distance,so you have two factors.If you sort of\nspread them out more,probably going to\nrequire less systems.JARED: And if you\nlooked that map,that's all at the end of a\nrunway at the Honolulu airport.So if you have a huge\nfield in Arizona,thousands of systems, your\nmean time between failureis going to be a lot better.MARK WINKLER: So I'm actually\nreally surprised that there'ssuch a huge effect\nfrom adding systems,just because it seems as\nthough the relevant lengthscales for weather\nshould be very large.Do you guys say\nanything about that?JARED: I think the idea was\nthat, for long-term weather,you can predict that.So if you know\nthere's going to bea storm front coming through,\nyou can add natural gas.You can add coal to the system.Back up--ASHLEY: And that would\ncover the entire system.JARED: Our kind of variability\nwe're talking aboutis say, if one cloud goes\nover, or a flock of birds,or something.So we were thinking\nthat would beon a few seconds\nfor a single

definitelyevenly dispersed in an area.JARED: That would be something\nthat, if we had another dataset that had wider\ndistances, it wouldbe very easy to plug it in.I think our code's\nreally

cost of failure versus, Iguess, the added incurred\ncost for transmission linesand so on, so there's\nsort of an optimum pointwhere you want to\nspace them and havea certain number of\nsystems where I
