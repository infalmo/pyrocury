and how it empowers our\nthoughts, or feelings, ordesires, or actions in the\nworld, and how we began tounderstand this remarkable\ncomplexity, or at least graspsomething of the complexity.How we understand the potential\nfor things likemoral character,\nand judgments.The case of Phineas Gage, to\nproduce language, to speak ourfeelings and thoughts that's\nblocked in a patient likeBroca's patient, with\nBroca's aphasia.We talked about the fact that\nsplit brain patients show usnot only to the left and right\nhemispheres of the human brainmediate separate mental\nabilities, but that they alsoseem to have almost independent\nforms ofconsciousness, or they\ndon't have to beaware of one another.And so my focus today is to say\nwe would learn from veryunusual clinical cases.And I'm going to focus today on\ntools we have to study thetypical human brain.And what is it that we can do to\nunderstand how your brain--without having ahemispherectomy or a big stroke--how does it operate, and what\nare the principles of humanbrain function they gave\nrise to the human mind?So what are the ways we can\nlearn about the human brain?And one thing we can't do is\nwhen animal researchers cando, we can't literally go inside\nthe brain except invery rare clinical situations.I'll talk about them, but it's\na rare source of evidence.So there's a million ways in\nwhich are trying to understand", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.997}, {"text": "which part of the brain is which\npart of the mind, and wetalked about the fact that\nphronology was a big misstepin assigning the functions of\nmental life to different partsof the brain.And so we hope we can do\na bit better than that.And I'm going to review with\nyou today some of the coremethods, and there's\na number of themstudying the human brain.The reason there's a number\nis none of themare the magic answer.All of them are limited in their\nown ways, and we sort ofneed all of them to begin\nto grasp how yourbrain makes your mind.There's three huge ways in which\nwe now have the humanbrain organized.Lesions, injuries to the brain,\nstimulation when you'reallowed to stimulate\nthe brain--rarer, but we'll talk\nabout that.And the most common, the one you\nsee all the time in booksand magazines, recording,\nfunctional MRI, EEG, methodswhere we record brain\nactivity, and try tounderstand how that relates to\nthe life of the human mind.And so we're going to go through\nthese things a littlebit and show you how they're\napplied in some ways that Ihope that you'll find\ninteresting.We'll come back to many of these\nthings as we go throughthe semester, and as we talk\nabout aging, or childdevelopment, or personality,\nor othertopics, social cognition.We'll use these tools to\nunderstand the brain bases ofthose kinds of aspects\nof our mental lives.So what's a big injury\nyou can have?You can have a stroke, where\ntissue in the brain no longerreceives its vascular supply\nthat it depends on so greatly.And a lot of different things\nlike hypoxia, lack of oxygen,the brain is very sensitive\nto oxygen.Tumors can grow, you could have\ndegenerative disorderslike Alzheimer's, Huntington's,\nParkinson's, andothers, epilepsy.So there's lots of different\nways in which you can end upwith brain injury, and\nultimately neuronal death.What's the strength of this\nform of evidence?Well first of all,\nit's causal.We've talked about the\ndifference between causal andcorrelational sources of\nevidence, causal ones be morepowerful for scientific\nexplanation.A certain part of the brain is\ninjured in you no longer canspeak, you change your\ncharacter, you no longer can", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "make memories.We're pretty sure that part of\nthe brain in some way isrequired, or causal, for\nthat part of yourmental life to operate.The deficits you see following\nbrain injuries can be amazing,we talked about Phineas Gage\nchanging his character, unableto produce language, unable\nto make new memories.We'll talk a little bit about\npatients with Prosopagnosia,it's a good big word to go home\non spring break and ifyour parents ask what have you\nlearned about, you sayProsopagnosia.That just means a deficit\nin recognizing faces.Patients with Prosopagnosia will\nbe unable to recognizetheir own spouse\nby their face.They'll recognize it by the\nvoice, by the physicalmovements, but not\nby their face.We learn amazing things about\nthe brain that until ithappens we didn't know that\ncould happen, what people liketo call counterintuitive.So we'll talk later in the\ncourse in a couple times aboutblindsight, patients who say,\nI see nothing, but theirbehavior shows some part of\ntheir brain sees something.We'll talk about category\nspecific deficits wherepatients all of the sudden can\nno longer name living things,but they can name nonliving\nthings.So you wouldn't have\nthought of that ifyou didn't see that.And we get separations\nin the brainbetween different things.We talked about the difference\nbetween the left hemispherebeing important for\nlocal features,the right for global.The left thinking in terms of\nfunctional things in theworld, the right in terms\nof appearances.We talked about that already.We'll talk about other things,\nthe hippocampus is importantfor knowing that, knowing a\npiece of information but theBasal Ganglia is important for\nlearning how to do things,mental skills and\nphysical skills.We'll come back to all of those,\nit gives us way toorganize things.Much of our most solid\nunderstanding of the humanbrain still comes from\nthe history ofneurology and lesions.But what are its limitations?First, brain injuries don't\nfollow anatomical boundaries,they sort of crossover things\ndepending on the injury.So they're not going to\nselectively damage one part ofthe brain and not touch an\nadjacent one they could bedoing something different.People can be variable\nin their response.Nearby systems, if you have two\nthings in the brain that", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "are next door to one another,\ndo quite different things.Injuries are likely to injure\nthem both, and you will have awrong conclusion about\nthe architectureof the human brain.When we test a patient and ask\nthem to do things after abrain injury, we don't really\ntest the part of the brainthat's not there.We really test a part of the\nbrain that is there, people dothe best they can.So there's secondary\ndegeneration to an injury,there's recovery from\ninjury, there'scompensation from an injury.When you test a patient with a\nbrain injury, you're testingwhat the rest of the brain can\ndo in the absence of one ofits companions.And finally can offer\nlimited views ofnormal brain function.Let me pick one and we'll\ncome back in the course.We're very interested in\nvariation in people--individuality--what's the neurology\nof individuality?That's very hard to study in\nlesion cases, because we don'tsee enough of a lesion.we don't have enough Phineas\nGages to ask would that injurylook different if you grew up in\none culture or another, ifyou were outgoing versus shy.Those kinds of things\nare very hard toanswer patient by patient.But we can test large groups of\npeople with imaging and askwhat's the influence of\nculture on your brainorganization?What's the influence of\npersonality on how yourbrain's organized?And you'll see later on in the\nsemester evidence about thosesorts of things.So let's go back to Paul Broca,\nthe neurologist whothey gave a name to Broca's\narea, because he sought apatient like this,\nlike [INAUDIBLE].That this patient had a big\ninjury in this area could nolonger speak.And every course you ever take\nabout the brain almost willinclude a discussion\nabout Broca's area.So I'm going to warp your world\nin a very narrow way,but maybe a shocking way, and\ntell you we don't even knowhow to think about Broca's\narea once we get morescientific than that.So because this is MIT\nso we're willing totell the truth, OK.So some years later Nina\nDronkers said the followingthing, she studied a large\ngroup of patients who hadBroca's aphasia by behavior.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.129}, {"text": "That is they had trouble\nspeaking, but thecomprehension was pretty good.And then she made maps of\ntheir injuries and sheoverlaid those maps.And she said who has Broca's\naphasia, and if you haveBroca's aphasia, what's the\none part of the brain thatevery patient with Broca's\naphasia has damage to.Because these patients--what you see on these maps is,\nsome patients have damagehere, or here, or here.But you line them all up and you\nsay, what's the one spotthat you have to have injured\nto have Broca's aphasia?And it's not this area that you\nsaw in the picture, it'sthis area, in yellow, an area\ncalled the Precentral Gyrus ofthe Insula.The Insula is a fascinating,\nmysterious little structure--you have one on the left,\nand one on the right--that runs along from the\ntemporal lobe, up to thefrontal cortex.Just a couple years ago there\nwas a paper reporting thatpatients who had stroke in\nposterior insula instantlygave up smoking, and never\nwanted to smoke again.There's huge research efforts\nto help people quit smoking,just because it's such a\ndifficult health problem.Nobody is doing insula lesions\nto help peoplestop smoking, OK.But it just stopped the smoking,\nand their desire tosmoke, just like that.This is now more towards the\nfront of the brain, this isnot what anybody in a book or\na course will tell you isBroca's area, that's out here.But it turns out this is the hot\nspot, and you could say,well what about the\noriginal patient?So kind of creatively Nina\nDronkers went back and theydid an MRI of the brain of the\ndeceased original Broca'saphasic patient.They still had his brain, they\nput it in a scanner and theyran a structural MRI.And what they found was sure\nenough he had damage wayinside the exterior limit of\nthis damage, in as well as inwhite matter that\nconnects to it.So even now imaging evidence\nlets us rediscover what is thetrue basis of your ability\nto speak, or itsvulnerability to injury.And it turns out not\nto be exactly whatBroca thought it was.He saw big lesion and he said,\nthis is the part of matters.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.179}, {"text": "It turns out, as far as we\nunderstand, it's a slightlydifferent part that he thought\nwas just at theedge and not important.So we can get better even going\nback to 150 years ofimaging a brain, we don't have\nmany of those brains around.Stimulation, so you like to go\nin the brain is stimulate.People who do animal work will\ngo in and stimulate a neuronand see what happens.It's rare, you only get into the\npatient's brain when theyhave a neurosurgical procedure\nand they're considering aresection, or removal\nof tissue.You can also do recordings\nby putting grids ontop of those brains.And Penfield did famous studies\nfor patients withepilepsy, where he would\nstimulate and map things thatcontributed a lot to our\nthinking about the brain.But that's a rare source of\nevidence, as you can imagine.Another one that's much more\ncommon-- there's one of thesedevices down the street\nin building 46--is Transcranial Magnetic\nStimulation, or TMS.So this is one in which people\nare allowed ethically, andresponsibly to give you a\nvirtual lesion for a fewmoments, if you volunteer\nto do so.So they put some sort of\nwire, there's differentconfigurations, over your head\nin a targeted location.It generates a magnetic field\nthat passes through the skulland induces a current.And what happens is the\ncurrent drives lotsof neurons to fire.Turns out, this is kind of\ninteresting, if all yourneurons are firing at the same\nmoment, in one sense it's asif none of them were, because\nthere's no information.There's a lot of different ways\nyou could think aboutthat, but for example if on your\n300 channel televisionyou had all the channels on\nsimultaneously on the samescreen, it wouldn't be\nvery easy to watch,something like that.All the neurons firing pretty\nmuch wipes out thefunction of that area.People do feel a little bit of\na physical sensation, ifyou're prone to epilepsy it's\nnot a good idea to try this,so it does require some\ncareful supervisionexperimentally.But you can do this with healthy\npeople, and if forexample you do it on this side\nof the motor cortex, peopletwitch or say they felt\nsomebody touch them.Nobody touched them, but the\npart of the brain that codes", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.187}, {"text": "for touch just got turned on.If you put it on the occipital\ncortex, visual cortex, and youturn on at a certain moment,\nyou could put a word up andword down, and the person will\nsay they saw nothing.You'll make them functionally,\ncorticallyblind for a few moments.People have done experiments\nlike this to suppressactivity, to enhance activity,\nsometimes it makes people evenfaster, like naming pictures.And it's also been used there's\nstill experimentalstudies of whether it can be\nhelpful for treatments ofneuropsychiatric disorders.It's not invasive, in a sense of\nyou're not going literallyinside, you have a causal thing\nbecause turning thebrain on or off.It's not very well targeted, it\ncan't go into subcorticalareas, but it's a very\ninteresting tool.Let's talk about recording brain\nstructure for a moment.It's really important to\nseparate this concept betweenrecording structure, which is\na picture of anatomy, orfunction, which is a picture\nof physiology.So there's old ones angiography,\nand things likethat, I'll show you two.Computed Tomography, and MR\nand a really cool measurecalled Diffusion\nTensor Imaging.And then, dysfunctional\nmeasures, and we'll talk aboutthose, EEG, PET, fMRI, MEG.So here's some different\nimages you canget from the brain.This is a post-mortem brain,\nthis is a cut brain, here'sthe front, here's the back.If a brain was open in\nfront of you, this iswhat you would see.So here's an MRI, Magnetic\nResonance Imaging, and it'spretty good, and I'll show you\nsome more pictures, in showingyou lots of information.Not as good as if you were in\nthere, but pretty good.Here's a CT scan, Computed\nTomography.It's not as good, it's\nmore blurry.And this thing that looks really\nsad, it looks like getyour camera to focus, that's\nactually the quality of thepicture that we see that\nunderlies maybe the mostwidely used tool these days for\nunderstanding the humanmind and brain, Functional\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging.It's a very smudgy picture,\nbut it has some reallyinteresting properties.So here's the kind of thing you\ngo into for an MRI, bothstructural or functional.Some of you have almost\ncertainly been participants in", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.186}, {"text": "research or experiments,\nor studies, stick upyour hand if you have.Oh, a lot of you, OK, so you'll\nspeak up on this, is itquiet or noisy?It's super noisy, so you have\nto have ear plugs in.And this is why people doing\nexperiments with thisFunctional MRI want to do\nvisual studies, becauseauditory ones are tricky.So Tyler, your head TA, likes\nauditory stuff, it's 10 timesharder to pull off those\nexperiments.Everybody tries to do visual\nstuff, so you don't have thenoise problem.But you get some beautiful\npictures, here's ComputedTomography.And here's an MRI structural\nscan from the brain, theventricles, here's\nBasal Ganglia.With an MRI, beautifully you can\nsee the difference betweenwhite and gray matter.I'm always impressed that\nthe gray matter isjust this thin ribbon.Cortex really means bark,\nit's just likethe bark on our tree.And when you look at the brain\nthis way, look at how muchwhite matter there is.Here's your frontal cortex, look\nat all that white matterand then this thin, cortical\nmantle, or ribbon, or bark.That's what we think of as the\nsmarts of language, and socialplanning, and things\nlike that.So that's a structural\npicture.And then these two pictures\nare sort of fun.This is just recorded down the\nstreet, we're going to flythrough your brain from\none ear to the other.And you get amazing resolution,\nit's not the samething like being inside\nthe brain.There's things that you don't\nsee, we know that,but you see a lot.Isn't that cool?Let's examine what\nyou can see now.Only about 40 years ago, you\nwould have to have a persondie to see this.This is a patient with\nHuntington's disease, we'llcome back and talk about\nthat disorder.Here's a healthy person,\ntop of the brain.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.207}, {"text": "This is the caudate here, part\nof the Basal Ganglia.And you could see in a patient\nwho has passed away that partof the brain is completely\nwithered away inHuntington's disease.You would have to wait until\nperson passed away to seesomething like that.Here's a healthy person\ntop of the brain,again lining the ventricle.This is the caudate.And here in a living\nHuntington's patients you cansee the great withering away.Some of cortex 2 in later\nstage of disease, butespecially in the\nBasal Ganglia.Here's a healthy older person,\nabout 70 years of age, top ofthe brain, bottom of the\nbrain, the ventricle.Here's on the left and right\nof the hippocampus, thestructure we'll talk about,\nwithout which you can cannotlearn any new fact,\nor remember anyevent in your life.So powerful for almost every\nsense of learning.And look what happens the\nstructure in the same agedpatient with Alzheimer's\ndisease.It's virtually gone, it's\ngreatly weathered.You see it's much wider here,\nbecause the tissue's greatlyshrunk in the Alzheimer's\npatient.So we can see these kinds of\nchanges in living people, forboth research purposes and\nclinical purposes.Here's one that's more cheerful,\nand more reflectingyour experience.Here are studies of brain\nchanges from age four to 21.So they follow a large number\nof people at NIHfrom age four to 21.And what this shows is this\ncolor coding is the thicknessof the cortex.And you might imagine that as\nyou get older, and smarter andgo through grade school, and\nmiddle school, and highschool, and MIT college, and\nas you head towards gradschool, your brain will\nget thicker, andthicker with cortex.It's exactly the opposite.Ever since you were about five\nyears old, you've beenshedding neurons by the\nmillions, and connectionsamong them by the trillions.And you're still going\nto do that until yourprobably about 22 or 23.Then you peak, and you decline\nand become faculty members.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "But that's really interesting,\nwe'll come back to this, thatwhat happens as your brain\nget smart, experienced,knowledgeable, all the\ndifferences between you now,if you're 17, 18, 19, 20, and\nwhen you were four, it allgoes with your cortex\ngetting thinner.And we'll come back to that\nand how people think aboutthat, but let's see if I can\nget this next movie to run.There's also an ordering-- and\nwe'll come back this but Iwant to show you this movie.So the more blue you are, the\nthinner you are, the moreadvanced you are in terms\nof ultimate young adultdevelopment.Here's visual cortex,\nvision coming in.This is Somatomotor Cortex, how\nyou feel, your body, andhow you move yourself.And what you see is, as you go\nfrom age four to 21, the bluespreads, that spreading is your\nbrain maturing in higherthought areas.So we're going to review your\nlife on average right now,here you go.And now you're ready\nto graduate.It's kind of an amazing story\nof fantastic brain changesthat move you from what you\ncould do and not do at four,to what you can do and\nnot do at age 21.And we couldn't see these\nthings, we couldn't begin tosee these things, until just\na few years ago in anyscientific sense.All these things are like\nmiraculous sources ofinformation.So let's pick another\nthing, and we'll tieit to school work.Here's the structure we\nsaid, the hippocampus.So important for the formation\nof new memories on an everydaybasis, everything that's\nimportant and that you learn.So here's a fun study they\ntook, and as you hear it,think about its scientific\nlimitation, but it's fun asstudents to think about.They looked at students in\nmedical school in Germany.They looked at the measure of\nan anatomic thickness of thehippocampus before and after\nthey studied like crazy for ahuge exam over some\nnumber of periods.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "This is the difference between\nthe two, and what they'reshowing you is that as you\nstudy, your hippocampus gotthicker as you crammed\nfor your test.So will there be a day where\ninstead of having to give youtests we could just measure\nthe thickness of yourhippocampus to know how much\nyou studied, and you couldjust zoom in and out of a\nscanner, I don't know.But one cool thing about it is\nit's showing you that we cansee structural changes not just\non a giant scale fromwhen you're four to 21, but from\nsome number of months ofexperience, we can see a\nphysical change in your brain.Now that's trivial for animal\nresearchers, they can showamazing things in seconds, but\nyou see the human brainphysically changing.So let's take a look at another\none, slightly morecontrolled, we'll look\nat two more examples.London taxi cab drivers.If you've travelled in various\ncities, and have gone invarious taxis, you may have\nhad better or worseexperiences whether the taxi\ndriver knows where he or sheis going exactly.London is famous for having a\nvery high code, taxi drivershave to take big exams to get\ntheir official taxi license,they create a very\ndemanding thing.And when they ask this in the\nhippocampus if you learn lotsof routes, if you know tons of\nroutes in London, what happensto the hippocampus as\nit's memorizing allthese special routes?And what they saw, that taxi\ndrivers had bigger hippocampi,and the longer they drove,\nthe bigger it was.So is this a causal orcorrelational source of evidence?It's correlational right?So let's start with this, they\nhave bigger hippocampi, andnow maybe that's simply\nbecause, what?Maybe somebody who has an\nawesome hippocampus is readyto go to be a taxi driver.Maybe they pass the test, and\nthe one who got lost all thetime, and was driving to the\nwrong airport and stuff, smallhippocampus, never became\na taxi driver.So the size of the hippocampus\nis the cause of your success,not the consequence.Because the longer you drove,\nthe bigger it got, that kind", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.12}, {"text": "of goes with that.But you could do a causal\nexperiment this way.They taught people to juggle\nthree balls, they practicedevery day for three months.Three months juggling\nevery day.What you see in yellow are parts\nof the brain-- that's astatistical map--parts of the brain that\nsignificantly got thicker inthree months of practice.So they could compare directly\nbefore and after, it's acausal experiment.And these are areas that are\ninvolved in the visual motion,and it makes sense that areas\ninvolved in visual motionwould somehow change.But the fact that we can see\nthree months of experiencechange the structure of your\nbrain, it's kind of remarkablein they way that we can measure\nand scientificallyscrutinize.You might be curious if you did\nthree months of this andyou were a pretty good juggler,\nyou're impressingyour friends at parties, your\nbrain scan is different.What do you think happened--they followed these people\nup-- after the jugglingrequirements stopped?They kind of stop, most of the\npeople, they were too busy.They would show off here and\nthere, but that was it.They measured their brain's\nagain about six months later,and this change was gone.It came in, and it went out\nwith the activity, it'sactivity dependent.So depending on what you do,\nyou could think about everyactivity you do-- mental and\nphysical that you do-- isconstantly slightly changing\nyour brain.And if you do a lot of it,\nyou're fundamentally changingit like in these individuals.But if you stop doing it you\ngo right back to where youwere, because you're going to\nbe doing something else.And another fun measure that's\nkind of beautiful andintriguing is Diffusion\nTensor Imaging.Now every [INAUDIBLE] we talked\nabout so far has beengray matter of the brain,\nthe neurons and then thecircuits they form.We're going to turn to white\nmatter, which is themyelinated axons that are\nthe super conductinghighways of the brain.And what Diffusion Tensor\nImaging does, it shows yousomething about the organization\nof that whitematter, measuring directly the\nmovement of water at very,very tiny distances.This is a cross-section of\na myelinated nerve fiber.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.114}, {"text": "Those are the fibers that are\ncovered with white matter thathave to go some distance.And the myelin protects the\nquality and speed of thatsignal through your brain.And you could see at the level\nof, if you're a tiny, tinydrop of water, or smaller than\nthat, this is a pretty bigbump in the road.So imagine you're a little drop\nof water moving a littlebit, and you bump up against the\nmyelin, you go oh, can'tgo that way, and you go\nback this way, andyou go with the flow.You go parallel with a myelin,\nit's hard to cross it at thatmicroscopic scale.But we can measure that movement\nin areas where it'shighly constrained, and that's\na property of the water.Here cerebral spinal fluid,\nthings can go anywhere.Here's where there's a lot of\nwhite matter, and the watertends to flow along parallel\nwith the white matter, justfor physical reasons it\ncan't cross it over.And here for example, is a\nstatistical map comparing thismeasure of white matter\norganization between adults,who either in their childhood\nhad a diagnosis of dyslexia,reading was difficult for\nthese individuals.Or people who typical reading\ndevelopment, where you learnedto read and wasn't particularly\ndifficult.And you can see that in this\narea around the TemporalParietal Cortex, there's a\nsignificant difference.But we can do one more thing.These are reading scores this\nway, this is the measure ofthe white matter organization\nfrom theDiffusion Tensor Imaging.Each of these as an individual\nperson now.So the open dots are the people\nwho had typical readingdevelopment.The filled dots are the people\nwho had poor development, andyou can see it's pretty\ncontinuous.Even in the people with the open\ncircles who never had aproblem, the better they\nread, the more theorganization is here.So this is not just the\ndifference between good andbad readers, it's a difference\nbetween really good readers,and medium readers, and poor\nreaders,

that.And then you can create these\nkinds of beautiful pictures,and I'll say a word\nabout this.So this is an individual\nperson's white matterorganization.So we could take this picture\nof you, or anybody you knowwho wants to go in a scanner.And what's color coded here in\nblue are fibers that arerunning up or down, we can't\ntell with the fibers whichdirection they're going,\nbut we can tell otherorientations.Up and down, left and right in\nred, up and down in blue, andgreen is front to back.Pretty cool, huh?I can tell you that I'll\nsay a word about this.Should we do that again?I like it, but I work\nin this area.This is fantastic, this is an\nindividual person's whitematter organization.As information is flowing around\nin your mind, here'sthe paths that it's flowing\naround in as you just doanything that's interesting\nin your feelings", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "or thoughts or anything.It's fantastic.I can tell you that the\nalgorithms that are used tocreate these maps, there's\nsome debateabout the better ones.So the last steps of this are\na bit debated, and a bitdepending on how cool you are\nas a visual engineer.But there's a lot of things\nthat's right about DiffusionTensor Imaging, there's\na lot of things thatare right about it.Function, so most of all we're\ninterested in structure, notjust for itself, but how is it\nmakes your mind do the thingsyou could do.And when we think about\ndifferent functional measuresthat are available to\nneuroscientists orpsychologists, we often think\nin two dimensions, SpatialResolution, and Temporal\nResolution.How precise are we where we are,\nand what's the time scalethat we're measuring in,\nmilliseconds, are we averagingover many seconds, many hours.We know mental operations,\nroughly speaking, occur at themillisecond level, or maybe\n10 milliseconds.There's no answer to that, but\nwe know lots of things happenthat fast in the mind.So if you look at this here you\ncan see that, for example,if you're in animal work,\nlooking at size, you can getdown to the Synapse\nor the Dendrite.We can't touch that in humans,\nwe can't touchthat cellular stuff.And it's not until we get up\nto here, which is like bigpatches of the brain, that we\ncan state things about people.That's why it's always going\nto be fundamental inneuroscience to link the human\nwork to the animal work,because we can't get to the\nneurons or anything like thatin a person almost ever.That has to come from animal\nwork, where you can doinvasive work.So we have to look at\na pretty big patchesof the human brain.How about time?Well, we can get down to\nmilliseconds in time in thehuman brain.Functional things like PET and\nMRI are here and in the orderof multiple seconds, I'll\ncome

electrodes,and they measure changes in\nelectrical activity that arebeing picked up through\nthe skull.And you're picking up huge\nchanges in hundreds ofthousands of neurons, but\nyou're able to do

correlational,not causal.But you get some amazing\nresults, I'm just going topresent to you two or three.So here's one, a thing we're\nvery interested about humansis empathy.How much we understand and feel\nother people's happiness,or sadness, or pain.So the \"observation or\nimagination of another personin a particular emotional state\nautomatically activatesa representation of that state\nin the observer,\" empathy.And how do we understand how\nanother person feels, and wethink that's a big thing\nin how we relate toone another as humans.So Tania Singer did the\nfollowing experiment, wetalked about this\nbefore a littlebit, embodied cognition.That we understand others out\nthere by the feelingswe know within us.We don't know their feelings,\nbut we know ourfeelings inside us.So here's what she did, she\nbrought in pairs of people whowere friends, or romantic\npartners.And she either had them get\nsome pain, it was a shock,within ethical boundaries, but\nnot pleasant, that's the pain.Or, you got to watch through a\nvideo camera, while you'rebeing imaged, your partner\ngetting the shock.So think about somebody you\ncare about and think aboutthem getting something painful,\nand how you wouldfeel at that moment.And they asked in the brain,\nwhat's similar and dissimilar,and we'll focus on what's\nsimilar right now, betweenfeeling pain yourself, and\nobserving pain in somebody you",

the same\nbrain areas as when you feelphysical pain directly.It's as if the basis to imagine\nanother person'sfeelings is the feelings you\nknow so well yourself.And this is literally shown\nnow by the brain imaging.It could've been a story, a\nmetaphor, an argument, this isscientific evidence that\nsupports that likelihood.So we're going to expend it\nin a slightly fun way.There's been a lot of study in\nneuroeconomics thinking abouthow we think about, for example,\nthings like trust.So one game, and there's a\nnumber of them, is called theultimatum game.And many people probably\nknow this, but let meremind you of this.This version of it has\ntwo players, aproposer, and a responder.And what they do is they give\nto proposer a certain amountof money, and the proposer is\nallowed to make an offer tothe responder.If the responder says, No,\nnobody gets any money.Usually people offered about\n50%, so let's make thisconcrete just for a moment.Can I pick you for a second?You can

they offer you half, andif you say no, nobody\ngets anything, soit's a trust game.They had the people in the\nscanner playing this game withtwo people they saw on\na video monitor.The two people

the\nfair player was very decent,this unfair player--who you believe is part of the\nexperiment, but is a set up--and you're just thinking, why\nis this person such a jerk?They're constantly getting $10,\nand constantly giving meone or two.No, no, no thank you.Now, you get a shock, and you\nsee these two strangers, oneof whom was a wonderful, fair\nplayer, and one of whom was anabsurdly unfair

difficult anddisturbing, but another place\nwhere imaging is giving usinsights that you could not\nimagined having some time ago.So this is a very difficult\ncase, I don't know if any ofyou gone through it, I don't\nwish it for you.Some of you probably have, and\nmany of you will at sometimein your life, when you have to\nmake an end of life decision.And amongst the most famous of\nthese cases was Terry Schiavo.Now I don't know that name even\nrings a bell for you, butit got very, very famous amongst\nthese kinds of cases.So she had a cardiac arrest,\nshe had took a lot of dietpills, and that may\nhave contributed.In February 25, 1990, she went\ninto a coma, and then avegetative state.So a vegetative state is when\na person seems to be kind ofawake, but when you talk with\nthem, they're not very aware,they're not responsive, they're\nnot noticing, they'renot talking.But their eyes are open, and\nthey're awake, their eyes arenot closed, so that's\nwhat she is.And they put in her a feeding\ntube, because without that shewouldn't live, she couldn't\neat and feed herself.It was a heartbreaking\ndifference of opinion betweenher husband and her parents.Her husband petitioned some\nyears later, actually eightyears later, to remove\nthe feeding tube andlet her pass away.The parents opposed that, they\nsaid that's not her wishes,she would want to keep on going\nwith the feeding tube.The husband said no, I don't\nbelieve that's her wishes.So you have this very tragic\nconfrontation between theparents who loved her, and the\nhusband who presumably lovedher having different ideas about\nwhat to do with her,whether to end her\nlife or not.So finally her tube was removed,\nbut then the parentswent to court, and a judge\nreversed it, and theyput the tube back.She became, sadly, kind of\nback and forth, livingnonliving, on judicial\ndecisions.Her case became particularly\nfamous, for a bunch ofreasons, and it went back and\nforth from court, to court.Moving up in the state courts,\nand there were several USSupreme Court decisions about\nwhether to remove the tube, or", "start": 3840.0, "heat": 0.114}, {"text": "keep the tube in.And it's a tragic thing, it's\na tragic choice between theparents and the husband.It got to the US Congress,\nin the US Senate.President Bush signed a bill\nto keep her alive.Everybody got involved, with\nvarious opinions, finally theSupreme Court made a series\nof decisions.It was disconnected in\n2005, and she died inMarch 31 of that year.So tragic difficult decision,\nand a tragic family situationthat became kind\nof a political,and judicial football.So what's going on in the mind\nof somebody like this, and howcould we even begin to interpret\nit for a person whocan't speak for themselves\nand can't respond.So let me tell you about\na different case, wedon't know her case.So, again a vegetative state is\none where you appear to beawake, but there's no\nsign of awareness.Eyes are open, but the person's\nnot talking orresponding to anything\nin their environment.So here's a different woman, 23\nyears old, in 2005 she hada road traffic accident, severe\ntraumatic brain injury.Five months later she's\nun-responsive, but she haspreserved sleep-wake, like\nshe's waking up going tosleep, waking up\ngoing to sleep.Eyes open, but un-responsive\nin every other way.They put her into an fMRI\nscanner, as well as healthycomparison people, and\nthey have them do tomental imagery tasks.they read instructions to her.But you go into scanner, and\nyou're told to imagine twodifferent things.Playing tennis, so imagine in\nyour mind's eye you playingtennis for a moment,\nimagine that.Or imagine visiting all the\nrooms of your house startingwith your front door, in the\nhouse that you are living innow, or where you grew up.Imagine those two things\nin your mind.First of all, just a pure\ncognitive neuroscience level,and we'll come back to that,\nimagination is a reallyinteresting thing.And it turns out when we imagine\nthings, again we usethe parts of our brain that\ndoes them, imagination isperception run backwards.We can see imagination\nin the human brain.And depending on what you're\nimagining, you use the samesystems that you see with.", "start": 3960.0, "heat": 0.226}, {"text": "If you imagine something you're\nlooking at, it willturn on your visual system,\nit's even morespecific than that.So let's first look at what\nhappens with the controls.When they imagine they're\nplaying tennis, they turn onthe supplementary motor area,\nthat's a part of your brainthat plans your physical\nmovements.You're not moving, but you're\nthinking about it, this isimagination of movement.When you plan a movement.,\nyou turn that on.When you go around your house,\nyou turn on spatial areas thatare in the parahippocampal\ncortex, and similar areas,parietal cortex, and\nparahippocampal cortex.They're turned on if we show\nyou a movie where you'removing around in spaces.If you see spaces, you turn\nthose on, if you imaginespaces, you turn them on.So imagination in the brain is\nperception run backwards, orphysical action run backwards,\nyou're not actually doing it.But look at this patient who\ngot in the scanner, who wasnon responsive, you read her the\ninstructions, and see whatshe does, and look\nat her brain.Asked to imagine tennis,\nasked to imagine therooms in her house.It looks just like that.What does that mean, just\nin a common sense,what does that mean?Did she understand the\ninstruction, at some levelyes, she wouldn't turn on those\nparts of the brain ifshe didn't understand the\ninstruction, she imagines thething you ask her to instruct.So this guy on the front page\nof the New York Times saidfMRI could tell you the internal\nmental life of aperson could no longer\nspeak, or communicatewith any other way.Now it's turned out since then,\nthat when they put inother patients into the scanner,\nmost of them don'tshow this pattern.So it's not that every patient\nin a vegetative state this isfull of mental life\nlike this person.And a deeper way, we don't\nreally understand what thismental life is like.We don't know whether she\nsimply understands somethings, but doesn't have\nfeelings, or plans, ordesires, or whether\nshe has those too.We don't understand really the\nfull
