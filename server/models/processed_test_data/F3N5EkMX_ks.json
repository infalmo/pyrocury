[{"text": "Welcome to Physics 8.01,\nMIT's introductory coursein classical mechanics for\nfirst year undergraduates.Im Deepto Chakrabarty.And I'm Peter Dourmashkin.We're the faculty members\nin charge of this course.The science of\nclassical mechanicsestablishes an important\nprinciple of cause and effect,wherein the changes\nin a bodys motionarise from the application\nof physical forces.Newton's Laws of\nMotion establishedthe scientific principle of\nanalyzing observed phenomenonthrough the use of clearly\narticulated mathematical modelsrather than through intuition.These concepts are so important\nto the modern branchesof science and\nengineering that werequire all of our\nundergraduates at MITto take classical mechanics\nregardless of whatever coursethey intend to specialize in.In many high school\nlevel physics courses,mechanics is taught\nas a set of formulasto memorize for a series\nof standard situations.Our course is different.Here, you will learn a set\nof fundamental principlesthat you can use to apply\nto unfamiliar situationsand analyze them rather\nthan just situationsthat you studied previously.8.01 assumes a strong background\nin high school level physicsand mathematics.We introduce and make extensive\nuse of calculus as needed,so a previous course in\ncalculus is not a prerequisite.However, it is a rigorous\nand technically challengingcourse aimed at\nMIT undergraduates.8.01's OpenCourseWare site\ncontains a coherent setof lessons that will take you\nthrough all the basic conceptsof classical mechanics as well\nas a set of advanced topicsincluding mass flow,\nsimple harmonic motion,and precessional motion.In each of these\nlessons, you willfind a series of short\nlightboard videosthat will help you\nunderstand concepts,mathematical derivations, and\nproblems solving techniques.In addition, you will find\nmany other useful resourcesincluding an online textbook,\nmany worked example problems,and MIT level problem sets.Developing a\ncommand of mechanics", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.479}, {"text": "is a powerful tool for\nunderstanding the worldaround us.Welcome to 8.01.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.38}]
