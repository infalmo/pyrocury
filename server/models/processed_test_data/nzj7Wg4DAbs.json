[{"text": "Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors\nwere insignificant animals.The most important thing to know\nabout prehistoric humansis that they were unimportant.Their impact on the world was not\nmuch greater than that of jellyfishor fireflies or woodpeckers.Today, in contrast,\nwe control this planet.And the question is:How did we come from there to here?How did we turn ourselves\nfrom insignificant apes,minding their own business\nin a corner of Africa,into the rulers of planet Earth?Usually, we look for the difference\nbetween us and all the other animalson the individual level.We want to believe -- I want to believe --that there is something special about me,about my body, about my brain,that makes me so superior\nto a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee.But the truth is that,\non the individual level,I'm embarrassingly similar\nto a chimpanzee.And if you take me and a chimpanzee\nand put us together on some lonely island,and we had to struggle for survival\nto see who survives better,I would definitely place my bet\non the chimpanzee, not on myself.And this is not something\nwrong with me personally.I guess if they took almost any one\nof you, and placed you alonewith a chimpanzee on some island,the chimpanzee would do much better.The real difference between humans\nand all other animalsis not on the individual level;it's on the collective level.Humans control the planet\nbecause they are the only animals", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.923}, {"text": "that can cooperate both flexibly\nand in very large numbers.Now, there are other animals --like the social insects,\nthe bees, the ants --that can cooperate in large numbers,\nbut they don't do so flexibly.Their cooperation is very rigid.There is basically just one way\nin which a beehive can function.And if there's a new opportunity\nor a new danger,the bees cannot reinvent\nthe social system overnight.They cannot, for example,\nexecute the queenand establish a republic of bees,or a communist dictatorship\nof worker bees.Other animals, like the social mammals --the wolves, the elephants,\nthe dolphins, the chimpanzees --they can cooperate much more flexibly,but they do so only in small numbers,because cooperation among chimpanzeesis based on intimate knowledge,\none of the other.I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee,and I want to cooperate with you.I need to know you personally.What kind of chimpanzee are you?Are you a nice chimpanzee?Are you an evil chimpanzee?Are you trustworthy?If I don't know you, how can I\ncooperate with you?The only animal that can combine\nthe two abilities togetherand cooperate both flexibly\nand still do so in very large numbersis us, Homo sapiens.One versus one, or even 10 versus 10,chimpanzees might be better than us.But, if you pit 1,000 humans\nagainst 1,000 chimpanzees,the humans will win easily,\nfor the simple reasonthat a thousand chimpanzees\ncannot cooperate at all.And if you now try to cram\n100,000

Stadium\nwith 100,000 chimpanzees.Complete madness.In contrast, humans normally\ngather there in tens of thousands,and what we get is not chaos, usually.What we get is extremely sophisticated\nand effective networks of cooperation.All the huge achievements\nof humankind throughout history,whether it's building the pyramids\nor flying to the moon,have been based not\non individual abilities,but on this ability to cooperate\nflexibly in large numbers.Think even about this very talk\nthat I'm giving now:I'm standing here in front of an audience\nof about 300 or 400 people,most of you are complete strangers to me.Similarly, I don't really know\nall the people who have organizedand worked on this event.I don't know the pilot\nand the crew members of the planethat brought me over here,\nyesterday, to London.I don't know the people\nwho invented and manufacturedthis microphone and these cameras,\nwhich are recording what I'm saying.I don't know the people\nwho wrote all the books and articlesthat I read in preparation for this talk.And I certainly don't know all the peoplewho might be watching this talk\nover the Internet,somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.Nevertheless, even though\nwe don't know each other,we can work together to create\nthis global exchange of ideas.This is something chimpanzees cannot do.They communicate, of course,but you will

might\ninterest chimpanzees.Now cooperation is, of course,\nnot always nice;all the horrible things humans\nhave been doing throughout history --and we have been doing\nsome very horrible things --all those things are also based\non large-scale cooperation.Prisons are a system of cooperation;slaughterhouses are a system\nof cooperation;concentration camps\nare a system of cooperation.Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses\nand prisons and concentration camps.Now suppose I've managed\nto convince you perhaps that yes,we control the world because we can\ncooperate flexibly in large numbers.The next question that immediately arisesin the mind of an inquisitive listener is:How, exactly, do we do it?What enables us alone, of all the animals,\nto cooperate in such a way?The answer is our imagination.We can cooperate flexibly\nwith countless numbers of strangers,because we alone, of all\nthe animals on the planet,can create and believe fictions,\nfictional stories.And as long as everybody believes\nin the same fiction,everybody obeys and follows\nthe same rules,the same norms, the same values.All other animals use\ntheir communication systemonly to describe reality.A chimpanzee may say, \"Look!\nThere's a lion, let's run away!\"Or, \"Look! There's a banana tree\nover there! Let's go and get bananas!\"Humans, in contrast, use their language\nnot merely to describe reality,but also to create new realities,\nfictional realities.A human can say, \"Look,\nthere is a god above

such a story.Only humans believe such stories,which is why we control the world,whereas the chimpanzees are locked up\nin zoos and research laboratories.Now you may find it acceptable that yes,in the religious field, humans cooperate\nby believing in the same fictions.Millions of people come together\nto build a cathedral or a mosqueor fight in a crusade or a jihad, because\nthey all believe in the same storiesabout God and heaven and hell.But what I want to emphasize\nis that exactly the same mechanismunderlies all other forms\nof mass-scale human cooperation,not only in the religious field.Take, for example, the legal field.Most legal systems today in the world\nare based on a belief in human rights.But what are human rights?Human rights, just like God and heaven,\nare just a story that we've invented.They are not an objective reality;they are not some biological effect\nabout homo sapiens.Take a human being,\ncut him open, look inside,you will find the heart, the kidneys,\nneurons, hormones, DNA,but you won't find any rights.The only place you find rights\nare in the stories", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.358}, {"text": "that we have invented and spread around\nover the last few centuries.They may be very positive stories,\nvery good stories,but they're still just fictional stories\nthat we've invented.The same is true of the political field.The most

can even smell it.But a nation or a state,like Israel or Iran or France or Germany,this is just a story that we've inventedand became extremely attached to.The same is true of the economic field.The most important actors today\nin the global economyare companies and corporations.Many of you today, perhaps, work\nfor a corporation,like Google or Toyota or McDonald's.What exactly are these things?They are what lawyers call legal fictions.They are stories invented and maintainedby the powerful wizards we call lawyers.(Laughter)And what do corporations do all day?Mostly, they try to make money.Yet, what is money?Again, money is not an objective reality;\nit has no objective value.Take this green piece\nof paper, the dollar bill.Look at it -- it has no value.You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,you cannot wear it.But then came along\nthese master storytellers --the big bankers,the finance ministers,the prime ministers --and they tell us a very convincing story:\"Look, you see
