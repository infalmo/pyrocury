were\ntalking about Coulomb'sforce law to describe the\ninteraction between twoparticles, and good job, most\nof you got this correct.So, what we're looking at here\nis the force when we have twocharged particles, one positive,\none negative --here, the nucleus\nand an electron.So, I know this is a simple\nexample and I can see everyonepretty much got it right, and\nprobably those that didn'tactually made some sort of\nclicker error is my guess.But I wanted to use this to\npoint out that in this classin general, any time you see\nan equation to explain acertain phenomenon, such as here\nlooking at force, it's agood idea to check yourself by\nfirst plugging it into theactual equation, so you can\nplug in infinity and thisequation here, and what you\nwould see is, of course, theforce, if you just solve the\nmath problem goes to zero.But you can also look at it\nqualitatively, so, if youthink about the force between\nthe electron and the proton,you could just qualitatively\nthink about what's happening.If they're close together\nthere's a certain force --they're attracted because they\nhave opposite charges, but asthat gets further and further\naway, that force is going toget smaller and smaller, and\neventually the force is goingto approach zero.So, it's a good kind of mental\ncheck as we go through thiscourse to remember every time\nthere's an equation, usuallythere's a very good reason for\nthat equation, and you can goahead and just use your\nqualitative knowledge, youdon't have to just always stick\nwith the math to checkand justify your answers.So, we can get started with\ntoday's lecture notes.And, as I mentioned, we left\noff and as we started back", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "here to describe the atom and\nhow the atom holds togetherthe nucleus and the electron\nusing classical mechanics.And today we'll finish that\ndiscussion, and, of course,point out actually the failure\nof classical mechanics toappropriately describe what's\ngoing on in an atom.So, then we'll get to turn to\na new kind of mechanics orquantum mechanics, which will\nin fact be able to describewhat's happening on this very,\nvery small size scale -- so onthe atomic size scale on the\norder of nanometers orangstroms, very small\nparticles.And the reason that quantum\nmechanics is going to workwhere classical mechanics\nfails is that classicalmechanics did not take into\naccount the fact that matterhas both wave-like and\nparticle-like properties, andlight has both wave-like and\nparticle-like properties.So, we'll take a little bit of a\nstep back after we introducequantum mechanics, and talk\nabout light as a wave, and thecharacteristic of waves, and\nthen light as a particle.And one example of this is in\nthe photoelectric effect.So, we just talked about the\nforce law to describe theinteraction between a proton\nand an electron.You told me that when the\ndistance went to infinity, theforce went to zero.What happens instead when the\ndistance goes to zero?What happens to the force?Yeah.So, the force actually goes to\ninfinity, and specifically itgoes to negative infinity.Infinity is the force when we're\nthinking about it andour brains, negative infinity\nis when we actually plug itinto the equation here, and the\nreason is the conventionthat the negative sign is just\ntelling us the direction thatthe force is coming together\ninstead of pushing apart.So, we can use Coulomb's force\nlaw to think about the forcebetween these two particles --\nand it does that, it tells usthe force is a function\nof that distance.But what it does not tell us,\nwhich if we're trying todescribe an atom we really want\nto know, is what happens", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "to the distance as\ntime passes?So, r is a function of time.But luckily for us, there's a\nclassical equation of motionthat will, in fact, describe how\nthe electron and nucleuschange position or change\ntheir radius asa function of time.So, that's -- does anyone know\nwhich classical law of motionthat would be?Yup, so it's going to be\nNewton's second law, forceequals mass times acceleration\n-- those of you that are quickpage-turners, have a little\none-up on answering that.And that tells us force as a\nfunction of acceleration, wewant to know it though as a\nfunction of radius, so we canjust take the first derivative\nand get ourselves to velocity.So, force is equal to\nmass times dv /dt.But, of course, we want to go\nall the way to distance, so wetake the second derivative and\nwe have this equation forforce here.And what we can do in order\nto bring the two equationstogether, is to plug in the\nCoulomb force law right here.So, now we have our Coulomb\nforce law all plugged in here,and we have this differential\nequation that we could solve,if we wanted to figure out\nwhat the force was atdifferent times t, or at\ndifferent positions of r.So, all you will have the\nopportunity to solvedifferential equations in\nyour math courses here.We won't do it in this\nchemistry course.In later chemistry courses,\nyou'll also get to solvedifferential equations.But instead in this chemistry\ncourse, I will just tell youthe solutions to differential\nequations.And what we can do is we can\nstart with some initial valueof r, and here I write r being\nten angstroms. That's a goodapproximation when we're talking\nabout atoms, becausethat's about the size\nof and atom.So, let's say we start off\nat the distance being tenangstroms. We can plug that\ninto this differentialequation that we'll have and\nsolve it, and what we find outis that r actually goes to zero\nat a time that's equal to10 to the negative 10 seconds.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So, let's think qualitatively\nfor a second about what thatmeans or what the real\nmeaning of that is.What that is telling us is that\naccording to Newtonianmechanics and Coulomb's force\nlaw, is that the electronshould actually plummet into\nthe nucleus in 0.1nanoseconds.So, we have a little bit\nof a problem here.And the problem that we have\nis that what we're figuringout mathematically is not\nexactly matching up with whatwe're observing experimentally.And, in fact, it's often kind of\ndifficult to experimentallytest your mathematical\npredictions -- a lot of peoplespend many, many years testing\none single mathematicalprediction.But, I think all of us right\nnow can probably test thisprediction right here, and we're\nobserving that, in fact,all of us and all the atoms we\ncan see are not immediatelycollapsing in less than\na nanosecond.So, just, if you can take what\nI'm saying for a moment rightnow that in fact this should\ncollapse in this very smalltime frame, we have to see that\nthere's a problem withone of these two things, either\nthe Coulomb force lawor Newtonian mechanics.So, what do you guys think is\nprobably the issue here?So, it's Newtonian mechanics,\nand the reason for this isbecause Newtonian mechanics does\nnot work on this very,very small size scale.As we said, Newtonian mechanics\ndoes work in mostcases, it does work when we're\ndiscussing things that we cansee, it does work even\non things that aretoo small to measure.But once we got to the atomic\nsize scale, what happens is weneed to be taking into account\nthe fact that matter has thesewave-like properties, and we'll\nlearn more about thatlater, but essentially classical\nmechanics does nottake that into account at all.So, we need a new kind of\nmechanics, which is quantummechanics, which will accurately\nexplain thebehavior of molecules\non this small scale.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So, as I mentioned, the real\nkey to quantum mechanics isthat it's treating matter not\njust like it's a particle,which is what we were just\ndoing, but also like it's awave, and it treats light\nthat way, too.The second important point to\nquantum mechanics is that itactually considers the fact that\nlight consists of thesediscrete packets or\nparticle-like pieces ofenergy, which are\ncalled photons.And if you think about what's\nactually happening here, thissecond point that light\nconsists of photons isactually the same thing as\nsaying that light showsparticle-like properties, but\nthat's such an important pointthat I put it separately, and\nwe'll cover that separately aswe go along.So, we now have this new way\nof thinking about how anucleus and an electron can\nhang together, and this isquantum mechanics, and we can\nuse this to come up with a newway to describe our atom and the\nbehavior of atoms. But theproblem is before we do this,\nit makes sense to take alittle bit of a step back and\nactually make sure we're allon the same page and\nunderstanding why quantummechanics is so important and\nhow it works, and specificallyunderstanding what we mean when\nwe say that light is botha particle and a wave, and that\nmatter is both a particleand a wave. So, we'll move on to\nthis discussion of light asa wave, and we really won't\npick up into going back toapplying quantum mechanics to\nthe atom until Friday, but inthe meantime, we'll really get\nto understand the waveparticle duality of light\nand of matter.So, we'll start with thinking\nabout some properties of wavesthat are going to be applicable\nto all waves thatwe're talking about, including\nlight waves.The easiest kind of waves for us\nto picture are ocean wavesor water waves, because we can,\nin fact, see them, butthey have similar properties\nto all waves.And those properties include\nthat you have this periodicvariation of some property.So, when we're talking about\nwater waves, the propertywe're discussing is just\nthe water level.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So, for example, we have this\naverage level, and then it cango high where we have the peak,\nor it can go very low.We can also discuss sound waves,\nso again it's just theperiodic variation of some\nproperty -- in this case we'retalking about density, so we\nhave high density areas andlow density areas.So, regardless of the type of\nwave that we're talking about,there's some common definitions\nthat we want tomake sure that we're all\nable to use, andthe first is amplitude.And when we're talking about\nthe amplitude of the wave,we're talking about\nthe deviation fromthat average level.So, if we define the average\nlevel as zero, you can haveeither a positive amplitude\nor a negative amplitude.So, sometimes people get\nconfused when they're solvingproblems and call the amplitude\nthis distance allthe way from the max to the\nmin, but it's only half ofthat because we're only going\nback to the average level.So, what we really want to\ntalk about here is lightwaves, and light waves have the\nsame properties as theseother kind of waves in that\nthey're the periodic variationof some property.So, when we're discussing\nlight waves, what we'retalking about is actually\nlight or electromagneticradiation, is what we'll\nbe calling itthroughout the course.And that's the periodic\nvariationof an electric field.So, instead of having the\nperiodic variation of water,or the periodic variation of\nair density, here we'retalking about an\nelectric field.We know what an electric field\nis, it's just a space throughwhich a Coulomb force\noperates.And the important thing to\nthink about when you'retalking about the fact that it's\na periodic variation, isif you put a charged particle\nsomewhere into an electricfield, it will, of course, go in\na certain direction towardthe charge it's attracted to.But you need to think about the\ndifference, if you have aparticle here on your wave, it\nwill go in one direction.But remember, waves don't just\nhave magnitude, they also dohave direction.So, if instead you put your\nparticle somewhere down hereon the electric field, or on the\nwave, the electric field", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "will now be in the other\ndirection, so your particlewill be pushed the other way.And from physics you know that,\nof course, if we have apropagating electric field, we\nalso have a perpendicularmagnetic field that's going\nback and forth.But in terms of worrying about\nusing the concepts of a waveto solve chemistry problems in\nthis course, we can actuallyput aside the fact, and only\nfocus on the electric fieldpart of things, because that's\nwhat's going to be interactingwith our charged particles,\nsuch as our electrons.So, other properties of waves\nthat you probably are allfamiliar with but I just want\nto review is the idea of awavelength.If we're talking about the\nwavelength of a wave, we'rejust talking about the distance\nthat there is betweensuccessive maxima, or of course,\nwe can also be talkingabout the distance between\nsuccessive minima.Basically, we can take any point\non the wave, and it'sthe distance to that same point\nlater on in the wave.So, that's what we call\none wavelength.We also commonly discuss the\nfrequency of a wave, and thefrequency is just the number of\ncycles that that wave goesthrough per unit time.So, by a cycle we'd basically\nmean how many times we cyclethrough a complete wavelength.So, if something cycles through\nfive wavelengths in asingle second, we would just say\nthat the frequency of thatwave is five per second.We can also mathematically\ndescribe what's going on hereother than just graphing it.So, if we want to look at the\nmathematical equation of awave, we want to describe --\nagain as I mention, what we'redescribing is the electric\nfield, we're not worryingabout the magnetic field here,\nas a function of x and tthat's equal to a cosine [\n2 pi x over wavelength,minus 2 pi nu t ].And note this is the\nGreek letter nu.This is not a v. Where we have\nE, which is equal to the", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "electric field, what is x?STUDENT: Position.PROFESSOR: Yup, the position of\nthe wave. And what about t?Yeah, so we're talking about\nboth position and time.So what we can do if we're\ntalking about a wave is thinkof it both in terms of position\ntime, but if we'retrying to visualize this -- for\nexample if we're actuallyto graph this out, the easiest\nthing to do is keep one ofthese two variables constant,\neither the x or the t, andthen just consider the\nother variable.So, for example, if we're to\nhold the time constant, thismakes it a lot simpler of an\nequation, because what we canend up doing is actually\ncrossing outthis whole term here.So what we're left with is just\nthat the electric fieldas a function of distance is a\ntimes cosine of the argumentthere, which is now just\n2 pi x over wavelength.So, what we want to be able to\ndo, either when we're lookingat the graph or looking at the\nequation up there, is to thinkabout different properties of\nthe wave. For example, tothink about at what point do we\nhave the wave where it's atits maximum amplitude?So, if we think about that, we\nneed to have a point wherewe're making this argument of\nthe cosine such that thecosine is going to all be equal\nto one, so all we'releft with is that a term.So, we can do that basically\nany time that we have aninteger variable that is either\nzero or an integervariable of the wavelength.So, for example, negative\nwavelength or positivewavelength are two times the\nwavelength, because that letsus cross out the term with the\nwavelength here, and we'releft with some integer\nmultiple of just pi.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So, that's sort of the\nmathematically how we get toa, but we can also just look\nat the graph here, becauseevery time we go one wavelength,\nwe can see thatwe're back in a maximum.So, I mentioned we should be\nable to figure out where themaximum amplitude is.You should also just looking at\nan equation, immediately beable to figure out what that\nmaximum amplitude is in termsof the height of it just by\nlooking at that a-term, herewe should also be able to know\nthe intensity of any lightwave, because intensity is just\nthe amplitude squared.So, we should immediately be\nable to know how bright or howintense a light is just looking\nat the wave equation,or just by looking at a graph.We can also do a similar\nthing, and I'll keep mydistance from the board, but\nwe can instead be holding xconstant, for example, putting\nx to be equal to zero, andthen all we're doing is\nconsidering the electric fieldas a function of t.So, in this case we're crossing\nout the first termthere, and we're left with\namplitude times the cosine of2 pi nu times t.And, of course, we can do the\nsame thing again, we can thinkabout when the amplitude is\ngoing to be at its maximum,and it's going to be any time\ncosine of this term now isequal to one.So that will be at, for example,\nnegative 1 over nu,or 0, or 1 over nu.And again, we can just look at\nour graph to figure that out,that's exactly where\nwe're at a maximum.So, 1 over nu is another term\nwe use and we call it theperiod of a wave, and the period\nis just the inverse ofthe frequency.And if we think about frequency,\nthat's number ofcycles per unit time.So, for example, number of\ncycles per second, whereas theperiod is how much time it takes\nfor one cycle to occur.And when we talk about units of\nfrequency, in almost every", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "case, you'll be talking about\nnumber of cycles per second.So, you can just write\ninverse second, thecycle part is assumed.But you'll also frequently see\nit called Hertz, so, Hz here.So, if you're talking about five\ncycles per second, youcan write five per second, or\nyou can write five Hertz.The one thing you want to keep\nin mind though is that Hertzdoes not actually mean\ninverse seconds, itmeans cycles per second.So, if you're talking about a\ncar going so many meters persecond, you can't say it's going\nmeter Hertz, you have tosay meters per second.So, this really just means\nfor frequency,it's a frequency label.Alright.So, since we have these terms\ndefined, we know the frequencyand the wavelength, it turns\nout we can also think aboutthe speed of the wave, and\nspecifically of a light wave,and speed and is just equal to\nthe distance that's traveleddivided by the time\nthe elapsed.And because we've defined these\nterms, we have ways todescribe these things.So, we can describe the distance\nthat's traveled, it'sjust a wavelength here.And we can think about how\nlong it takes for a wave,because waves are, we know not\njust changing in position, butthe whole wave is moving forward\nwith time, we canthink about how long it takes\nfor wave to go one wavelength.So, one distance that's\nequal to lambda.So, how much time would that\ntake, does anyone know?So, would it take, for example,\nthe same amount oftime as the frequency?The period, that's right.So, it's going to take one\nperiod to move that long.And another way we can say\nperiod is just 1 over nu or 1over the frequency So, now\nwe know both the distancetraveled and the time\nthe elapsed.So, we can just plug it in.Speed is equal to the distance\ntraveled, which is lambda overthe time elapsed, which is 1\nover nu. so, we can re-writethat as speed is equal to lambda\ntimes nu, and it turns", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "out typically this is reported\nin meters per second ornanometers per second.So, now we have an equation\nwhere we know the relationshipbetween speed and wavelength\nand frequency, and it turnsout that we could take any wave,\nand as long as we knowthe frequency and the\nwavelength, we'll be able tofigure out the speed.But, of course, there's\nsomething very special aboutelectromagnetic waves,\nelectromagneticradiation and the speed.And it's not really surprising\nfor me to tell you thatelectromagnetic radiation has\na constant speed, and thatspeed is what we call the speed\nof light, and typicallywe abbreviate that as c, and\nthat's from the Latin termceleritas, which means\nspeed in Latin.That's one of four or five Latin\nwords I remember fromfour years of high school Latin,\nbut it comes in handyto remember speed of light.And some of you may have\nmemorized what the speed oflight is in high school -- it's\nabout 3 times 10 to the 8meters per second.This is another example of\na constant that you willaccidentally memorize in this\ncourse as you use it over andover again.But again, that we will supply\nfor you on the exam just incase you forget it\nat that moment.And this is a very fast speed,\nof course, it's about 700million miles per hour.So, one way to put that in\nperspective is to think abouthow long it takes for a\nlight beam to get fromearth to the moon.Does anyone have any guesses?Eight seconds, that\nsounds good.Anyone else?These are all really good\nguesses, so it actually takes1.2 seconds for light\nto travel from theearth to the moon.So, we're talking pretty\nfast, so that's nice toappreciate in itself.But other than that point, we\ncan also think about the factthat frequency and wavelength\nare related in a way that now", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "since we know the speed of\nlight, if we know one we cantell the other.So, you can go ahead and switch\nus to our clickerquestion here.So, we should be able to look\nat different types of wavesand be able to figure out\nsomething about both theirfrequency and their wavelength,\nand know therelationship between the two.So, it's up on this screen\nhere now, so we'll workon the other one.If you can identify which of\nthese statements is correctbased on what you know about\nthe relationship betweenfrequency and wavelength\nand also justlooking at the waves.Alright.So, let's give ten more\nseconds on that.So, ten seconds on that.Alright.So, good job.So, most people could recognize\nthat light wave ahas the shorter wavelength.We can see that just by looking\nat the graph itself --we can see, certainly, this is\nshorter from maxima to maxima.This we can't even see\nthe next maxima,so it's much longer.And then, we also know that\nmeans that it has the higherfrequency, because our\nrelationship betweenwavelength and frequency\nare inversely related.And also, we know the\nspeed of light.So, if we think about if it's a\nshorter wavelength, we'll beable to get a lot more\nwavelengths in, in a giventime, than we would for\na longer wavelength.So, we can switch back to the\nnotes and think about whatthis means, and what this means\nwhen we're talking aboutall the different kinds of light\nwaves we have, and I'veshown a bunch here, is that if\nwe have the wavelength, wealso know the frequency\nof these wavelengths.So, for example, radio waves,\nwhich have very long", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "wavelengths have very\nlow frequencies.Whereas where we go to waves\nthat have very shortwavelengths, such a x-rays or\ncosmic rays, they, in turn,have very high frequencies.So, it's important to get a\nlittle bit of a sense of whatall these different kinds\nof lights do.You're absolutely not\nresponsible to memorize whatthe wavelengths of the different\ntypes of lights are,but you do want to be\nable to know thegeneral order of them.So, if someone tells you they're\nusing UV light versusx-ray light, you know that the\nx-ray light is, in fact, at ahigher frequency.So that's the important\ntake-awaymessage from this slide.If we think about these\ndifferent types of lights,microwave light, if it's\nabsorbed by a molecule, is asufficient amount of frequency\nand energy to get thosemolecules to rotate.That, of course, generates\nheat, so that's how yourmicrowaves work.If we talk about infrared light,\nwhich is at a higherfrequency here and a shorter\nwavelength, infrared lightwhen it's absorbed by molecules\nactually is enoughto cause molecules\nnow to vibrate.If we move up to the more\nhigh-frequency and divisiblelight and all the way into UV\nlight, if you shine UV lightat certain molecules, it's going\nto have enough energy toactually pop those electrons\nin that molecule up to ahigher energy level, which will\nmake more sense once wetalk about energy levels in\natoms, but that's what UVlight can do.And actually, that's responsible\nfor fluorescenceand phosphorescence that\nyou see where typicallyUV light comes in.So, if you use a black lamp or\nsomething and you excitesomething up to a higher energy\nlevel and then itrelaxes back down to its lower\nenergy state, it's going toemit a new wavelength of light,\nwhich is going to bevisible to you.X-rays are at even a higher\nfrequency, and those aresufficient to actually be\nabsorbed by a molecule and popan electron all the way\nout of that molecule.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "You can see how that would be\ndamaging to the integrity ofthat molecule, that's why x-rays\nare so damaging -- youdon't want to have electrons\ndisappearing for no goodreason from your molecules that\ncan cause the kind ofmutations we don't want to\nbe seeing in ourselves.And then also as we go\nhigher, we have gammarays and cosmic rays.Within the visible range of what\nwe can see, you also wantto know this relative order\nthat's pretty easy -- most ofus have memorized that\nin kindergarten, sothat should be fine.Just remembering that violet is\nthe end that actually hasthe shortest wavelength, which\nmeans that it also has, ofcourse, the highest frequency.So, just an interesting fact\nabout this set of light, whichwe're most familiar with, if we\nthink about our vision, itturns out that our vision's\nactually logarithmic and it'scentered around this\ngreen frequency.So, if instead of a red laser\npointer here, I had a greenone, you'd actually, to our\neyes, it would seem like thegreen one was brighter, even if\nthe intensity was the same,and that's just because our\neyes are centered andlogarithmic around this\ngreen frequency set.So, using the relationship\nbetween frequency andwavelength, we can actually\nunderstand a lot about what'sgoing on, and pretty soon\nwe'll also draw therelationship very soon to\nenergy, so it will be evenmore informative then.But I just want to point out one\nof the many, many groupsat MIT that works with different\nfluorescing types ofmolecules, and this is Professor\nBawendi's laboratoryat MIT, and he works\nwith quantum dots.And quantum dots are these just\nvery tiny, tiny crystalsof semiconductor material.They're on the order of one to\nten nanometers, and these canbe shined on with UV light

they", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "drop back down, they actually\nemit light with a wavelengththat corresponds with the size\nof the actual quantum dot.So, from what we know so far,\nwe should be able to look atany of these quantum dots,\nwhich are depicted as acartoon here, but here we have\nan actual picture of thequantum dots suspended in some\nsort of solution and shone onwith UV light, and you can see\nthat you can achieve thiswhole beautiful range of colors\njust by modulating thesize of the different dots.And we should be able to know if\nwe're looking at a red dot-- is a red dot, it's going to\nhave a longer wavelength, sois this a higher or\nlower frequency?Yeah, and similarly, if someone\ntells us that theirdot is blue-shifted, that should\nautomatically in ourheads tell us, oh it shifted\nto a higher frequency.And these dots are really\ninteresting in that you can,I'm sure by looking at this\npicture, already imagine justa whole slew of different\nbiological or sensingapplications that you\ncould think of.For example, if you were trying\nto study differentprotein interactions, you could\nthink about labelingthem with different colored\ndots, or there's also a bunchof different fluorescent\ntechniques that you couldapply using these dots, or you\ncould think of in-vivosensing, how useful these could\nbe if you could think ofa way to get them into your body\nwithout being too toxic,for example.These are all things that the\nBawendi group is working on.What they are real experts in is\nsynthesizing many differentkinds of these dots, and they\nhave a synthetic scheme that'sused by research groups\naround the world.The Bawendi group also\ncollaborates with people, bothat different schools\nand at MIT.One example, on some of their\nbiochemistry applications iswith another Professor at MIT,\nAlice Ting and her lab.So really what I want to point\nout here is as we get moreinto describing quantum\nmechanics, these quantum dotsare one really good example\nwhere a lot of the propertiesof quantum mechanics\napply directly.So, if you're interested, I put\nthe Bawendi lab research", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "website onto your notes.And also, Professor Bawendi\nrecently did an interview with\"The Tech.\" Did anyone see that\ninterview in the paper?So, three or four -- a few of\nyou read the paper last week.So, you can either pick up an\nold issue or I put the link onthe website, too.And that's not just about his\nresearch, it's also about someof his memories as a student\nand advice to all of you.So, it's interesting to read and\nget to know some of theseProfessors at MIT a\nlittle bit better.So, one property that was\nimportant we talked about withwaves is the relationship\nbetween frequency andwavelength.Another very important property\nof waves that's trueof all waves, is that you can\nhave superposition orinterference between\ntwo waves.So, if we're looking at waves\nand they're in-phase, and whenI talk about in-phase, what I\nmean is that they're lined up,so that the maxima are in the\nsame position and the minimaare in the same position, what\nwe can have a something calledconstructive interference.And all we mean by constructive\ninterference isthat literally those two waves\nadd together, such as themaxima are now twice as high,\nand the minima arenow twice as low.So, you can also imagine a\nsituation where instead ofbeing perfectly lined up, now we\nhave the minima being linedup with the maxima here.So, if we switch over to a\nclicker question maybe on thisscreen -- okay, can it be\ndone up there to switch?So, we're still settling\nin with the renovationshere in this room.So, why don't you all go ahead\nand tell me what happens ifyou combine these two waves,\nwhich are now out of phase?So, let's -- okay, so, why\ndon't you all think about", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "would happen -- we'll start\nwith the thought exercise.You can

havedestructive interference.And destructive interference, of\ncourse, is the extreme, butyou can picture also a case\nwhere you have waves that arenot quite lined up, but they're\nalso not completelyout of phase.So in that case, you're either\ngoing to have the wave get alittle bigger, but not\ntwice as big ora little bit smaller.So, I think the easiest way to\nthink about interference isnot actually with light, but\nsometimes it's easiest tothink about with sound,\nespecially when you're dealingwith times where you have\ndestructive interference.Has anyone here ever been in a\nconcert hall where they feellike they're kind of in a dead\nspot, or you don't quite hearas well, and if you move down\njust two seats all of a suddenit's just blasting at you --\nhopefully not in this room.But have people experienced\nthat before?Yeah, I definitely experienced\nit, too.And really, all you're\nexperiencing there isdestructive interference\nin a very bad way.Halls, they try to design halls\nsuch that that doesn'thappen, and I show an example of\na concert hall here -- thisis Symphony Hall in Boston,\nand I can pretty muchguarantee you if you do go to\nthis Symphony Hall, you willnot experience a bad seat\nor a dead seat.This is described as actually\none of the top two or threeacoustic concert halls\nin the whole world.So, it's very well designed such\nthat they've minimizedany of these destructive\ninterference dead sounds.", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So, it's nice, on a student\nbudget you can go and get theworst seat in the house and you\ncan

these\non, but you see peoplewith them, and what happens here\nis it's supposed to bethose noise cancellation\nheadphones.All they do is they take in\nthe ambient noise that'saround it, and there's actually\nbattery in theheadphones, that then produces\nwaves that are going todestructively interfere with\nthat ambient noise.And that's how it actually gets\nto be so quiet when youhave on, supposedly, these quite\nexpensive headphones.So, that's light as a wave, and\nthe reason -- well, thatwas sound as a wave, but light\nas a wave is the same idea.And it was really established\nby the early 1900s that, infact, light behaved as a wave.\nAnd the reason that it was socertain that light was a wave\nwas because we could observethese things -- we could see,\nfor example, that lightdefracted, and we could see that\nlight constructively ordestructively could interfere\nwith other light waves, andthis was all confirmed\nand visualized.But also, around the time that\nThomson was discovering theelectron, there were some other\nobservations that weregoing on, and the most\ndisturbing to kind of theunderstanding of the universe\nwas the fact that there weresome observations about light\nthat didn't make sense withthis idea that light\nis a particle.And the photoelectric effect\nis maybe the most clearexample of this.So, the photoelectric effect is\nthe effect that if you havesome metal, and you can pick\nessentially any metal youwant, and you shine light of a\ncertain frequency onto thatmetal, you can actually pop off\nan electron, and you cango ahead and measure what the\nkinetic energy of thatelectron that comes off is,\nbecause we can measure thevelocity and we know that\nkinetic energy equals 1/2 m b", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "squared, and thanks to\nThomson we also knowthe mass of an electron.So, this is an interesting\nobservation, and in itself nottoo disturbing, yet but the\nimportant thing to point outis that there's this threshold\nfrequency that is of themetal, and each metal has a\ndifferent threshold frequency,such as if you shine light on\nthe metal where the frequencyof the light is less than the\nthreshold frequency, nothingwill happen -- no electron will\npop off of that metal.However, if you shine a light\nwith a frequency that'sgreater than the threshold\nfrequency, you will be able topop off an electron.So, people were making this\nobservation, but this wasn'tmaking any sense at all because\nthere was nothing inclassical physics that\ndescribed any sort ofrelationship between the\nfrequency of light and theenergy, much less the energy of\nan electron that would getpopped off of a metal that would\nbasically come off onlywhen we're hitting this\nthreshold frequency.So, what they could do was\nactually graph what washappening here, so we can also\ngraph what was happening, andwhat they found was that if we\nwere at any point below thethreshold frequency and we were\ncounting the numbers ofelectrons that were popping off\nof our metal, we weren'tseeing anything at all.But if you go up the threshold\nfrequency, suddenly you seethat there's some number of\nelectrons that comes off, andamazingly, the number of\nelectrons actually had norelationship at all to the\nfrequency of the light.And this didn't make a lot of\nsense to people at the timebecause they thought that the\nfrequency should be related tothe number of electrons that\nare coming off, because youhave more frequency coming in,\nyou'd expect more electronsthat are coming off\n-- this wasn'twhat people were seeing.So, what they decided to do\nis just study absolutelyeverything they could about the\nphotoelectric effect andhope, at some point, someone\nwould piece something togetherthat could explain what's going\non or shed some light on", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "this effect.So, one thing they did, because\nit was so easy tomeasure kinetic energy of\nelectrons, is plot thefrequency of the light against\nthe kinetic energy of theelectron that's coming\noff here.And in your notes and on these\nslides here, just for yourreference, I'm just pointing\nout what's going to bepredicted from classical\nphysics.You're not responsible for\nthat and we won't reallydiscuss it, but it just gives\nyou the contrast of thesurprise that comes up when\npeople make theseobservations.And the first observation was\nthat the frequency of thelight had a linear relationship\nto the kineticenergy of the electrons\nthat are ejected here.This made no sense at all to\npeople, and again they sawthis effect where if you were\nbelow that thresholdfrequency, you saw\nnothing at all.So, that was frequency\nwith kinetic energy.The next thing that they wanted\nto look at was theactual intensity of the light\nand see what the relationshipof intensity to kinetic\nenergy is.So, what we would expect is that\nthere is a relationshipbetween intensity in kinetic\nenergy, because it wasunderstood that however intense\nthe light was, if youhad a more intense light,\nit was a higherenergy light beam.So that should mean that the\nenergy that's transferred tothe electron should be greater,\nbut that's not whatyou saw at all, and what you\nsaw is that if you kept thefrequency constant, there was\nabsolutely no change in thekinetic energy of the electrons,\nno matter how highup you had the intensity\nof the light go.You could keep increasing the\nintensity and nothing wasgoing to happen.So, we could also plot the\nnumber of electrons that areejected as a relationship to the\nintensity, so that was yetanother experiment\nthey could do.And this is what they had\nexpected that there would beno relationship, but instead\nhere they saw that there was alinear relationship not to the\nintensity and the kineticenergy of the electrons, but\nto the intensity and thenumber of electrons.", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So, none of these observations\nmade sense to any scientistsat the time, and really all of\nthese observations were madeand somewhat put aside for\nseveral years before someonethat could kind of process\neverything that was going onat once came along, and that\nperson was Einstein,conveniently enough -- if anyone\ncould put it together,we would hope that he\ncould, and he did.And what he did in a way that\nmade sense when all of us lookat it, is he plotted all of\nthese different metals on thesame graph and made\nsome observations.So, for example, here we're\nshowing rubidium and potassiumand sodium plotted where we're\nplotting the frequency --that's the frequency of that\nlight that's coming into themetal versus the kinetic energy\nof the electron that'sejected from the surface\nof the metal.And what he found here, which is\nwhat you can see and we canall see pretty clearly, is the\nslope of all of these lines isthe same regardless of what\nthe type of metal is.So, he fit all these to the\nequation of the line, and whathe noticed was the slope was\nspecifically this number,6.626 times 10 to the negative\n34, joules times seconds.And he also found that the y\nintercept for each one ofthese metals was equal to\nbasically this number here,which was the slope times the\nminimum frequency required ofeach specific metal, so that's\nof the threshold frequency.And he actually knew that this\nnumber had popped up before,and a lot of you are familiar\nwith this number also, andthis is Planck's constant.Planck had observed this number\nas a fitting constantyears earlier when he looked at\nsome phenomena, and you canread about in your book, such\nas black body radiation.And what he found was he needed\nthis constant to fithis data to what was observed.", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And this is the same thing that\nEinstein was observing,that he needed this fitting\nconstant, that this constantwas just falling right out of,\nfor example, this slope andalso the y intercept.So he decided to go ahead and\ndefine exactly what it is,this line, in terms of these new\nconstants, this constanthe's calling h, which is\nPlanck's constant.So, on the y axis we have\nkinetic energy, so wecan plug that in.If we talk about what the x\naxis is, that's just thefrequency of the light\nthat's coming in.We know what m is,\nm is equal to h.And then we can plug in what b\nis, the y intercept, becausethat's just the negative\nof h timesthat threshold frequency.So we have this new equation\nhere when we're consideringthis photoelectric effect,\nwhich is that the kineticenergy is equal to h nu minus\nh nu threshold of the metal.And what Einstein concluded\nand observed is that well,kinetic energy, of course,\nthat's an energy term, and htimes nu, well that has to be\nenergy also, because energyhas to be equal to energy --\nthere's no other way about it.And this worked out with units\nas well because we're talkingabout joules for kinetic energy,\nand when we're talkingabout h times nu, we're talking\nabout joules timessecond times inverse seconds.So, the very important\nconclusion that Einstein madehere is that energy is equal to\nh times nu, or that h timesnu is an actual energy term.And this kind of went along\nwith two observations.The first is that energy\nof a photon isproportional to its frequency.So this was never recognized\nbefore that if we know thefrequency of a photon or a wave\nof light, we can know theenergy of that light.So, since we know that there's\nrelationship also betweenfrequency and wavelength, we can\ndo the same thing

made up of these energypackets, and each packet has\nthat h, that Planck'sconstant's worth of energy in\nit, so that's why you have tomultiply Planck's constant\ntimes the frequency.Any frequency can't have an\nenergy, you have to -- youdon't have a continuum of\nfrequencies that are of acertain energy, it's actually\npunctuated into these packetsthat are called photons.And, as you know, Einstein made\nmany, many, many veryimportant contributions to\nscience and relativity, but hecalled this his one single most\nimportant contribution toscience, the relationship\nbetween energy and frequencyand the idea of photons.So this means we now have a new\nway of thinking about thephotoelectric effect, and that\nis the idea that h times nu isactually an energy.So, it's the energy of an\nincident photon if we'retalking about nu where we're\ntalking about the energy ofthe photon going in, so we can\nabbreviate that as e sub i,energy of the incident photon.We can talk about also h times\nnu nought, which is thatthreshold frequency.So this is a term we're going\nto see a lot, especially inyour problem sets, it's called\nthe work function, and thework function is the same\nthing as the thresholdfrequency of a metal, except,\nof course, that it'smultiplied by Planck's\nconstant.So, it's the minimum energy that\na certain metal requiresin order to pop a photon out of\nit -- in order to eject anelectron from the surface\nof that metal.So this is our new kind of\nschematic way that we canthink about looking at the\nphotoelectric effect, so ifthis is the total amount
