three EMTs\nrushing in the front door,rushing up to the\nroom where Bob was.And they take all his vitals.And they can't find\nanything wrong.And so they're really casual.I guess they confront

good.We'll go on.Why should we study the brain?First, most obvious\nreason, know thyself.Know what this thing is\nthat's operating in our heads.This is who you\nare, is your brain.There are lots of very fine and\nimportant organs in the body,but the brain is special.So, a heart is important.You'd die without it.But it's the brain\nthat's your identity.There's a reason that\nsurgeons do heart transplants.That makes sense.Something wrong with your heart,\nyou need another heart, OK.But why don't they\ndo brain transplants?That wouldn't make sense.If there's something\nwrong with my brain,it doesn't make sense to\ntake someone else's brainand put it in here, because\nthen I'd be that other person.It doesn't make sense, because\nthe brain is who you are.So the brain is really special.It's not just another organ.That's why, a few years ago, we\nhad the decade of the brain--not the decade of the pancreas,\nor the liver, or the kidney.People need to\nstudy these things.They need to know\nhow to fix them.They're important.But they're not as\ncosmic as the brain.Second reason why we\nshould understand brains,and that is to understand the\nlimits of human knowledge.The more we understand\nabout the human mind,the more we can\nactually evaluatehow good our knowledge is.Are there things that we\nmight not be able to think?", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.154}, {"text": "Possible

that.And crucially, I\nwant you guys to beable to read current\npapers in the field.If you look in the syllabus,\nthe first few papersare, like, 20\nyears old, but it'sgoing to accelerate quickly\nand

trivial.When I write a scientific\npaper, right in my area,where I have all of the\nbackground, it takes me hours--hours.It may be five pages.It still takes me hours.It's just how it is.So when I

this.And it will be very\nspecific-- like,state your exact\nhypothesis, stateyour exact experimental\ndesign, et cetera.And you'll get practice with\nthose things in advance.Those are the grading\nand requirements.And this is the-- you have this\nall in the syllabus in frontof you.This is the lineup of topics.But very briefly, let me try to\ngive you the arc of the class.So this is the introduction.Next time, we're going\nto do just a teeny bitof neuroanatomy.There will be a teeny bit of\noverlap with 900 and 901 there.I'm going to whip through\nit in very superficial form.I'm doing that largely because\non the following class,we have an amazing\nprivilege, whichis that one of the greatest\nneuroscientists alive today,Ann Graybiel's, will be doing\nan actual brain dissection,right here in this class,\nright in front of you.It's going to be awesome.I can't wait.It's an incredible privilege.It will be a real human\nbrain, and you guys will be--Ann will be here with\nall her apparatus,and you guys will\nbe clustered around.And if it's this\nmany, god help us,but we'll figure out\nhow to make it work.I may-- let me just say, if\nthere are listeners in here,I may have to tell\nlisteners they can't come,because very sensitive about\nnot having too many people.Stay tuned on that.I haven't quite decided yet.It depends how many people\nare taking the class.But it's going to be amazing.And I want to remind\nyou of just some basicsso you're not asking her,\nlike, what is the hippocampus?I should all know that, but\nwe'll just do bare basics.And then we'll have\nthe dissection.That will be great.And also, another\nthing to say is,I mentioned that the subcortical\nregions are going to getshort shrift in this class.That's true.But a lot of what you\nsee in the dissectionis the subcortical stuff.Cortex is great but, it\nkind of all looks the same.", "start": 3960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "You kind of can't say,\noh, that's this region.That's the other region.Well, you can, but it\ndoesn't look any differentfrom any other region.That's where the subcortical\nstuff will happen.Then I'm going to do\na couple of lecturesthat focus on high-level vision,\nperceiving motion, and color,and shape, and faces,\nand scenes, and bodies,and stuff like that.And we will use those both\nto teach you that content,and also to teach you vast\narray of methods in this field.We will then have a\nlecture on the kindof debates about\nthe organizationof visual cortex in humans.I have a particular view.I'm very fond of views\nthat some patches of cortexare very, very\nfunctionally specific.Not everyone believes that.So I have assigned\nreadings of peoplewho have different views,\nand we will consider that.I will try to expose you\nto the alternate viewsand tell you why I'm teaching--\nwhy I still believe mine,but why other smart people\nbelieve different things.We will then move up the\nsystem from perception,and we will spend two meetings\ntalking about scene perceptionand navigation.You got a hint about what\nan interesting area this isfrom the story of Bob.We'll consider more\nwhat we've learnedfrom studies of patients\nwith brain damage,from functional MRI, from\nphysiology in animals,from cognitive science, from\nthe whole glorious menagerieof methods to\nunderstand navigation.It's a really fascinating area.In the two lectures after that,\nwe'll consider development.How do you wire up a brain?How much is present at birth?What is specified in the genes?What is learned?And a lot of that will focus\non the navigation systemand the face system,\nsimply because that'swhere there's a lot known.We'll consider\nsome other things,but those are two\nareas where there'ssuper exciting work from just\nthe last three or four years.That's what we'll\nfocus on there.I'm then going to do a lecture\non brains in blind people.", "start": 4080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "How are they different?How are they the same?What does that tell us?And then you have the midterm.Then we're going to move\non and consider number.How do you like instantly\nknow that that's three fingersand that's two\nwithout having to doanything all that complicated?And if I had 25 fingers\nand held them up,you would immediately get a\nsense that it was about 25.You might not know\nif it was 22 or 28,but you would know\nit was about 25.And there are\nparticular brain regionsthat compute that for you.And we will consider\nall of that.And there's a very rich\narray of informationfrom studies of\ninfant cognition,from animal behavior, from brain\nimaging, from brain damage,from single-unit physiology, and\nfrom computation, all of whichinform our\nunderstanding of number.Those are my favorite\nlectures, wherewe can take one\ndomain of cognitionand inform it with\nall of the methods.And numbers are a\nreally great example.Then we'll talk a\nlittle bit about--one of my TAS said,\ncall it neuroeconomics.That will sound good.But actually, what\nI'm going to try to dois sort of neuroeconomics.But it will be about pleasure,\nand pain, and reward,and how we think\nabout those things.And then that's down to April 3.Just as a side note,\nall of these thingsare things that are pretty\nsimilar between humansand-- at least primates.And some of them are\nshared with rodents.And most of the\nthings after thatare things that are\nreally uniquely human.We'll be really moving away,\nwith less available animalliterature to inform the\nstuff we're looking at,because animals can't\ndo these things.And so necessarily far from the\ndetails of individual neuronsand circuits, but\nthere's still lots coolthat can be said about\nhow you understand speech,how you appreciate music.There will be a guest\nlecture, just for fun,on brain-machine interface\nby Michael Cohen, who'sworking in my lab\nnow, and who hasa great lecture on this topic.Then we'll spend a couple\nof lectures on language--how you understand\nand produce

you\nguys have too much work,and that's why\nyou're sleepy, and Ishouldn't take it personally.I'm still noticing.Anyway, then we'll go on\nand consider brain networks.Of course, brain\nfunction doesn'thappen in just a single region,\neven if we spend a lot of timestudying individual regions.There's considerable\nwork trying to figure outwhich sets of regions\nwork together,and how could we discover that,\nand what are those broadernetworks of brain regions?And then on May 6,\nyou will have turnedin your longer\nwritten assignmentdesigning your own experiment.And then on May 6, we will\nwork together in groupsto refine those experiments\nand really hash out the detailsso you actually know how\nto design an experiment.And then we will have this\nguest lecture from my postdoc,Katherina Dobbs, on deep nets\nand what they can tell usabout cognition and brains.And then we'll talk about\nattention and awareness.And then I'm not\ntotally sure whatwe're going do in\nthe last class,but what I'm voting for is\nthat the amazing TAs eachgive a short talk on the\ncool stuff they're doing.But that's under discussion.OK, that's the arc of the class.Questions?All clear?Great.Well, if I have\nfive more minutes,maybe I'll do one\nother little thing.Let me try this.You asked-- I'm going to try\nto learn everybody's names,but I'm not doing that\nyet, because some of youmight not show up and I will\nhave wasted a whole pieceof my brain encoding it.I'm just kidding.But anyway, I remember\nthat you asked, are you", "start": 4320.0, "heat": 0.379}, {"text": "going

inversionon the human fusiform face area.We'll talk about\nthat more later.But if you fish\nthrough the abstract,you should be able to find\nwhat question is being asked.And it's the first thing\nyou

this, you have\nto go beyond the abstract.And I should say, for even\nthese earlier questions,sometimes you won't find\nthem in the abstract.That just means the abstract\nis not well written.But that
