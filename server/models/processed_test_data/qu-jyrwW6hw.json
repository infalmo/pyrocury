harmonic oscillator,I want to touch on\na few concepts thathave been mentioned in class\nand just elaborate on them.It is the issue of nodes,\nand how solutions look at,and why solutions have\nmore and more nodes, whythe ground state has no nodes.This kind of stuff.So these are just a collection\nof remarks and an argumentfor you to understand a\nlittle more intuitively whythese properties hold.So one first thing\nI want to mentionis, if you have a Schrodinger\nequation for an energyeigenstate.Schrodinger equation for\nan energy eigenstate.You have an equation of the\nfrom minus h squared over 2m.d second dx squared psi of\nx plus v of x psi of x equale times psi of x.Now the issue of\nthis equation is", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.107}, {"text": "that you're trying to solve for\ntwo things at the same time.If you're looking at what\nwe call bound states, nowwhat is a bound state?A bound state is something that\nis not extended all that much.So a bound state will\nbe a wave functionthat goes to 0 as the absolute\nvalue of x goes to infinity.So it's a probability function\nthat certainly doesn'textend all the way to infinity.It just collapses.It's normalizable.So these are bound\nstates, and you'relooking for bound\nstates of this equation.And your difficulty is\nthat you don't know psi,and you don't know E either.So you have to solve a problem\nin which, if you were thinkingoh this is just a plain\ndifferential equation,give me the value of E.\nWe know the potential,just calculate it.That's not the way it\nworks in quantum mechanics,because you need to have\nnormalizable solutions.So at the end of the day,\nas will be very clear today,this E gets fixed.You cannot get\narbitrary values of E's.So I want to make a couple of\nremarks about this equation.Is that there's this\nthing that can't happen.Certainly, if v of x is a smooth\npotential, then if you observerthat the wave function\nvanishes at some point,and the derivative\nof the wave functionvanishes at that same\npoint, these two thingsimply that psi of\nx is identically 0.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And therefore it\nmeans that you reallyare not interested in that.That's not a solution of\nthe Schrodinger equation.Psi equals 0 is obviously solves\nthis, but it's not interesting.It doesn't represent\nthe particle.So what I claim here\nis that, if it happensto be that you're\nsolving the Schrodingerproblem with some\npotential that is smooth,you can take derivatives of it.And then you encounter that\nthe wave function vanishesat some point, and its slope\nvanishes at that same point.Then the wave function\nvanishes completely.So you cannot have\na wave function,a psi of x that\ndoes the following.Comes down here.It becomes an inflection\npoint and goes down.This is not allowed.If the wave function\nvanishes at some point,then the wave function\nis going to do this.It's going to hit at an angle,\nbecause you cannot have thatthe wave function is 0 and needs\nthe derivative 0 at the samepoint.And the reason is simple.I'm not going to\nprove it now here.It is that you have a second\norder differential equation,and a second order\ndifferential equationis completely determined\nby knowing the functionat the point and the the\nderivative at the point.And if both are 0s, like\nthe most trivial kindof initial condition, the only\nsolution consistent with thisis psi equals 0 everywhere.So this can't happen.And it's something good\nfor you to remember.If you have to do a\nplot of a wave function,you should never have this.So this is what we call the\nnode in a wave function.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.225}, {"text": "It's a place where the\nwave function vanishes,and the derivative\nof the wave functionbetter not vanish at that point.So this is one claim that\nit's not hard to prove,but we just don't try to do it.And there's another claim that\nI want you to be aware of.That for bound states\nin one dimension,in the kind of thing that we're\ndoing now in one dimension,no degeneracy is possible.What do I mean by that?You will never find\ntwo bound statesof a potential that\nare different thathave the same energy.It's just absolutely impossible.It's a very wonderful\nresult, but also I'mnot going to prove it here.Maybe it will be given as an\nexercise later in the course.And it's discussed\nin 805 as well.But that's another statement\nthat is very important.There's no degeneracy.Now you've looked at\nthis simple potential,the square well infinite one.And how does it look?You have x going from 0 to a.And the potential is 0.From 0 to a is\ninfinite otherwise.The particle is bound\nto stay inside the two", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.376}, {"text": "walls of this potential.So in here we've plotted the\npotential as a function of x.Here is x.And the wave functions are\nthings that you know already.Yes?AUDIENCE: Is it true if you have\ntwo wells next to each otherthat there's still no degeneracy\nif it's an infinite barrier?PROFESSOR: If there's\ntwo wells and there'san infinite barrier\nbetween them,it's like having two universes.So it's not really a\none dimensional problem.If you have an infinite\nbarrier like two worldsthat can talk to each other.So yes, then you\nwould have degeneracy.It's like saying you can have\nhere one atom of hydrogenor something in one energy\nlevel, here another one.They don't talk to each other.They're degenerate states.But in general, we're talking\nabout normal potentialsthat are preferably smooth.Most of these things are true\neven if they're not smooth.But it's a little more delicate.But certainly two\npotentials thatare separated by\nan infinite barrieris not part of what we\nreally want to consider.OK so these wave functions\nstart with m equals 0, 1, 2,3, and psi ends of x are\nsquare root of 2 over a sin nplus 1 pi x over a.Things that you've seen already.And En, the energies\nare ever growingas a function of the integer\nn that characterizes them.2ma squared.And the thing that you\nnotice is that psi 0has technically no nodes.That is to say these\nwave functions

continuous.There cannot be any wave\nfunction to the left.So it has to vanish here.These things don't\ncount as nodes.It is like a bound state\nhas to vanish at infinity.And that's not what\nwe count the node.A node is somewhere\nin the middleof the range of x where\nthe wave function vanishes.So this is the ground state.This is psi zero has no nodes.Psi one would be something\nlike that, has one node.And try the next ones.They have more and more nodes.So psi n has n nodes.And the interesting thing\nis that this result actuallyis true for extremely\ngeneral potentials.You don't have to just\ndo the square wellto see that the ground\nstate has no nodes.That first excited state was one\nnode, and so on and so forth.It's true in general.This is actually a\nvery nice result,but its difficult to prove.In fact, it's pretty\nhard to prove.So there is a nice argument.Not 100% rigorous,\nbut thoroughly niceand really physical\nthat I'm goingto present to you why\nthis result is true.So let's try to do that.So here is the general case.So I'm going to take\na smooth v of x.That will be of this kind.The potential, here is\nx, and this potentialis going to be like that.",

find,as you let a go to\ninfinity, you willfind the bound states of\nthe original potential.It's reasonable\nthat that's true,because as you\nremove the screen,you're letting more of\nthe potential be exposed,and more of the\npotential be exposed.And the wave functions\neventually die, so as the timethat you're very far away,\nyou affect the wave functionsless and less.So that's the argument.We're going to try\nto argue that we'regoing to look at\nthe bound statesof the screened potentials and\nsee what happened, whether theytell us about the bound\nstates the original potential.So for this, I'm going\nto begin with a screenpotential in which\na goes to 0 and saythat a is equal to\nepsilon, very small.So what potential so do I have?A very tiny potential here\nfrom epsilon to minus epsilon.Now I chose the original point\ndown here to be the minimum.So actually, the bottom part of\nthe potential is really flat.And if you take\nepsilon going to 0,well, the potential\nmight do this,but really at the bottom for\nsufficiently small epsilon,this is an infinite square\nwell with psis to epsilon.I chose the minimum so that you\ndon't get something like this.If it would be a\npoint with a slope,this would be an ugly thing.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.754}, {"text": "So let's choose the minimum.And we have the screen\npotential here, and that's it.Now look what we do.We

try to increasethe value of the screen a.So suppose we've\nincreased the screen,and now the potential is here.And now we have a finite screen.Here is the potential.And I look at the wave function.How it looks.Here is psi 0.This ground state psi 0.Well, since this thing in here,\nthe potential becomes infinite,the wave function\nstill must vanish hereand still must vanish here.Now just for your\nimagination, think of this.At this stage, it still more\nor less looks like this.Maybe.Now I'm going to ask, as I\nincrease, can I produce a node?And look what's going to happen.So suppose it might happen\nthat, as you increase,suddenly you produce a node.So here's what I'm saying here.I'm going to show it here.Suppose up to this\npoint, there is no node.But then when I double\nit, when I increase itto twice the size, when I go\nto screen potential like that,", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.342}, {"text": "suddenly there is a\nnode in the middle.So if there is a\nnode in the middle,one thing that could have\nhappened is that you have this.And now look what must\nhave happened then.As I stretch this, this slope\nmust have been going down,and down, and down, until\nit flips to the other sideto produce a node here.It could have\nhappened on this side,but it's the same, so\nthe argument is justdone with this side.To produce a node you\ncould have done somehowthe slope here must\nhave changed sine.But for that to happen\ncontinuously, at some pointthe this slope must have been 0.But you cannot have\na 0 and 0 slope.So this thing can't\nflip, can't do this.Another thing that\ncould have happenedis that when we\nare here already,maybe the wave function\nlooks like that.It doesn't flip at the\nedges, but produces somethinglike that.But the only way this\ncan happen continuously,and this potential is\nchanging continuously,is for this thing at\nsome intermediate stage,as you keep stretching the\nscreen, this sort of startsto produce a depression here.And at some point, to get\nhere it has to do this.But it can't do this either.It cannot vanish and have\nderivative like that.So actually, as you\nstretch the screen,there's no way to\nproduce a node.That property forbids it.So by the time you go and\ntake the screen to infinity,", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.275}, {"text": "this wave function has no nodes.So that proves it that the\nground state has no nodes.You could call this\na physicist proof,which means-- not in\nthe pejorative way.It means that it's\nreasonable, it's intuitive,and a mathematician working\nhard could make it rigorous.A bad physicist proof is\none that is a little sloppyand no mathematician could\nfix it and make it work.So I think this is a good\nphysics proof in that sense.Probably you can\nconstruct a real proof,or based on this, a\nvery precise proof.Now look at excited states.Suppose you take now here\nthis screen very little,and now consider the third\nexcited state, psi three.I'm sorry, we'll call this psi\n2 because it has two nodes.Well, maybe I should do psi 1.Psi 1.One node.Same thing.As you increase\nit, there's no wayto create another\nnode continuously.Because again, you have\nto flip at the edges,or you have to\ndepress in the middle.So this one will evolve\nto a wave function thatwill have one node in\nthe whole big potential.Now stayed does that\nstate have more energythan the ground state?Well, it certainly begins with\na small screen with more energy,because in the square well\npsi 1 has more energy.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.118}, {"text": "And that energy should\nbe clear that it's notgoing to go below the\nenergy of the ground state.Why?Because if it went below the\nenergy of the ground stateslowly, at some point for\nsome value of the screen,it would have the same\nenergy as the ground state.But no degeneracy is possible\nin one dimensional problems.So that can't happen.Cannot have that.So it will always\nstay a little higher.And therefore with one node you\nwill be a little higher energy.With two nodes will\nbe higher and higher.And that's it.That's the argument.Now, we've argued by this\ncontinuous deformation processthat this potential not\nonly has these bound states,but this is n nodes and En is\ngreater than En prime for ngreater than n prime.So the more nodes,\nthe more energy.Pretty nice result,\nand that's reallyall I wanted to say\nabout this problem.Are there any questions?Any?OK.So what we do now is\nthe harmonic oscillator.That's going to keep us busy\nfor the rest of today's lecture.It's a very interesting problem.And it's a most famous quantum\nmechanics problem in a sense,because it happens to be useful\nin many, many applications.If you have any\npotential-- so whatis the characteristic of\nthe harmonic

oscillation.And this you know from\nclassical mechanics.If you have a harmonic\noscillator of this form, yeah,it actually oscillates\nwith this frequency.And E is the energy\noperator, and thisis the energy of the oscillator.So what defines an oscillator?It's something in which the\npotential energy, this termis v of x.v of x is quadratic in x.That is a harmonic oscillator.Then you arrange

has\nthe units of energy.And you good with that.And why is this useful?Because actually in any sort\nof arbitrary potential, rathergeneral potential\nat least, wheneveryou have a minimum where\nthe

and solvethe Schrodinger equation.This is our first step in\nunderstanding the system.There's going to\nbe a lot of workto be done even once we have\nthe solutions of the Schrodingerequation.But the first thing\nis to figure outwhat are the energy\neigenstates or the solutionsof the Schrodinger\nequation for this problem.So notice that here\nin this problemthere's an energy quantity.Remember,

that.But if you want an\napproximate value,dimensional analysis will do it,\nroughly what is it going to be.Well, with this constant how\ndo you produce an energy?Well, you remember\nwhat Einstein did,and you know that h bar\nomega has units of energy.So that's an energy associated\nwith Lagrangian energylike quantity.And we expect that\nthat energy is", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.158},

you construct a\nlength from these quantities?Well, you can start\ndoing m omega h barand put powers and struggle.I hate doing that.I always try to find some\nway of doing it and avoidingthat thing.So I know that\nenergies go like hover h squared over\nm length squared.So I'm going to call\nthe length a quantity a.So ma squared.That has units of energy.And you should remember\nthat because energyis b squared over 2m,\nand b by De Broglieis h bar over sub lamda.So h bar squared, lambda\nsquared, and m here,that's units of energy.So that's a length.On the other hand,\nwe have another wayto construct an energy\nis with this thing,m omega squared length squared.So that's also m omega\nsquared a squared.That's another energy.So from this equation I\nfind that a to the fourthis h squared

the\nSchrodinger equation?The Schrodinger\nequation for this thingis going to be minus h\nsquared over 2m, d second psi,dx squared plus the potential,\none half m omega squaredx squared psi is equal E psi.And the big problem is I don't\nknow psi and I don't know E.Now there's so many elegant\nways of solving the harmonicoscillator.You will see those next lecture.Allan Adams will be back here.But we all have to go\nthrough once in your lifethrough the direct, uninspired\nmethod of solving it.Because most of the times\nwhen you have a new problem,you will not come up with\na beautiful, elegant methodto avoid solving the\ndifferential equation.You will have to struggle with\nthe differential equation.So today we struggle with\nthe differential equation.We're going to just do it.And I'm going
