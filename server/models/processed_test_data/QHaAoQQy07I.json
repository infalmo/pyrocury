[{"text": "DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and\nwelcome back to recitation.In this problem, I'd like you to\ncompute the area of a triangle.This triangle sits\nin space and ithas its three vertices labeled\nhere as P_1, P_2, and P_3.So we're going to\ncompute this area,and we're going to do it\nusing the cross product, whichwe learned about in lecture.So why don't you take some\ntime to work this out,pause the video, and we'll\ncheck back in a minuteand see how I did it.Hello and welcome back.So the first thing that I\nlike to do with a problemlike this is I like to draw a\npicture so I can kind of thinkabout what's going on.So we have this triangle\nsitting out in space.And we know that we want to\ntake a cross product in orderto compute its area, but\nwe need to be careful.Cross product, it\ndoesn't make senseto take cross product of points.What makes sense is to take\ncross product of vectors.So the first thing\nthat we need to dois build some vectors that\ndescribe this triangle.And the vectors that we need\nto build are P_1P_2 and P_1P_3.Since we're going to use these\nin a minute, let's go aheadand compute them now.So P_1P_2 is just the\ndifference of P_2 minus P_1.So we get a 0\nminus a negative 1.So we get 1, 2, and 1.Let me just check my notes to\nmake sure I did that right.Good.And P_1P_3.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.312}, {"text": "We get again 0\nminus a negative 1.So 1, we get minus\n1, and then we get 1.Let me again check my notes.Very good.OK.So now that we\nhave these vectors,we need to remember\nthat if we takethe absolute value of P_1P_2\ncross product with P_1P_3,this will be equal to the\narea of the parallelogram theyenclose.So let's get started by\ncomputing this cross product.So P_1P_2 cross P_2P_3.So, remember, to\ncompute a cross product,we take the determinant of a\nmatrix where we put in our unitnormal vectors i, j, and k.And then we enter in, the\nremaining entries of the matrixare just the entries\nof our vectors.So we do [1, 2, 1].And [1, -1, 1].OK.And so we can compute this.And we get-- so the i component,\nwe get 2 minus a negative 1.So we get 3.Now the j component.If we look at the cofactor\nmatrix, it's just [1, 1; 1, 1],and that has determinant 0.So our middle\ncomponent is just 0.And finally the k component.We get minus 1, minus another 2.So altogether, we get minus 3.So what that tells us\nnow is that this quantity", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "here, the magnitude\nof the cross product,is just 3 times the\nsquare root of 2,just looking at the length\nof this vector here.So we're almost done, but\nlet's go back and lookat what we had to start with.We were interested in\nthe triangle over herewhich was enclosed\nby the vectors P_1P_2and the vectors P_1P_3.And what we just\ncomputed is actuallythe area of this parallelogram,\nwhich as you can seeis twice the area\nof the trianglethat we're actually\ninterested in.So going back over here, we see\nthat the area of our triangleis equal to 3 root\n2, and we justneed to divide by 2\nto get the triangle.OK?And I'll leave it at that.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}]
