[{"text": "[SQUEAKING][RUSTLING][CLICKING]JONATHAN GRUBER:\nToday, we're goingto continue our discussion\nof consumer choice.And we're going to\ntalk now about whathappens when we take that\nunconstrained choice we talkedabout on Monday and\nimpose budget constraints.We'll talk about what\nbudget constraints are.We'll then come to talking\nabout how consumersmake constrained choices.And then we'll end with\nan example of food stamps.So let's start by talking\nabout budget constraints.And we'll start by talking\nabout their construction,the construction of\nbudget constraints.So, basically, last\ntime, we talkedabout the fundamental\naxiom of consumer choicethat more is better.So what stops people from\njust bingeing on everything?It's their budget constraint.It's their limited resources.Now, for most of\nthis course, we'regoing to make a simplifying\nassumption that your budget--that is what you spend--equals your income.That is what you earn, OK?That is there won't be any\nsavings or borrowing, OK?Now that is a\nsimplifying assumption.And, indeed, we'll\nspend a couple lecturesat the end of the semester\ntalking about what happenswhen people can save or borrow.That said, this is not\na terrible descriptionof most Americans.The median American household\nhas $400 in the bank.So this is not kind of\na terrible descriptionof the way most people live\ntheir lives in America,which is what they\nearn each week iswhat they spend each week.So that's what we'll do.It also might not be sort\nof a terrible descriptionof your life.I presume, in college, you're\nnot doing a lot of savings.You maybe do a little\nborrowing, but nota lot of savings or borrowing.So what we're going\nto do is we'regoing to assume that's\ntrue for you as well.We're going to assume your\nparents have given you", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.208}, {"text": "some amount of money to spend.We'll call it Y. Your income\nY is the amount of moneyyour parents have given\nyou to spend for saythe semester or the month.And, once again, let's say\nall you spend your money onis pizza and cookies, OK?That's all you want to\nspend your money on.We write the budget\nconstraint as sayingthat your resources,\nyour income Y,can be spent on either\npizza or cookies.And the constraint is\nthat you could spend it--that budget has to be divided\nbetween pizza, where there'sthe price per slice of pizza\ntimes the number of sliceof pizza, or cookies.We have the price per cookie\ntimes the number of cookies.So p sub p is the price\nper slice of pizza.p sub c is the price per cookie.P is the number of pizzas, and\nC is the number of cookies.That's your budget constraint.You can essentially\ndevote your incometo some combination\nof pizza and cookies,but you have to consider\nhow much they actuallycost in doing that.I find this easier\nto see graphically.So let's turn to figure 3-1.Figure 3-1 shows a\nbudget constraint.So how does the budget\nconstraint look?Well, the x-axis is\nyour income dividedby the price of cookies.That is, if you decide to devote\nall your income to cookies,then how many\ncookies can you have?Y over pc.If your income is $100,\nand cookies are $10--that means you're going\nto Insomnia Cookies--then you can only have\n10 cookies, et cetera.Likewise, the\ny-intercept is the incomedivided by the price of pizza.That's how many\npizzas you can have.The budget constraint\nrepresents--the budget constraint, the\nslope of the budget constraint,is the price ratio, the\nnegative of the price ratiobecause it's a downward-sloping\nline, pc over pp.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.243}, {"text": "That is every extra\ncookie that youbuy, holding your\nincome constant,lowers the amount of pizza\nyou can have by p sub p, OK?So let's consider an example.Suppose that Y is $96,\nthat the price of pizza--it's an expensive\npizza place-- is $12,and the price of a\ncookie is $6, OK?$12 for pizza, this is like\ndowntown San Francisco or NewYork.$96 income, $12 for a slice\nof pizza, $6 for a cookie, OK?I'm sorry.Y is-- I wanted to\nmake Y 72, my bad.So Y is 72.Your income is $72, OK?And you can spend it\non pizza and cookies,and those are the prices.Now what that means is,\nif you wanted just pizza,you could get six pizzas.If you wanted just cookies,\nyou can get 12 cookies.And, generally,\nthe rate at whichyou can trade off pizza for\ncookies is minus 1/2, OK?That is every additional\ncookie would require giving uphalf a slice of pizza, OK?Every additional cookie requires\ngiving half a slice of pizza.That's why the slope\nwould be negative 1/2, OK?So, basically, we're going to\ncall the slope of the budgetconstraint--the slope, we are going\nto call the Marginal Rateof Transformation, the MRT.Last time, we did the MRS, the\nMarginal Rate of Substitution.Now we're going to have\nMRT, the marginal rateof transformation, which is\nequal to minus pc over pp.Or the slope of the\nbudget constraint, OK?That is the marginal\nrate of transformation.Now this class is not alchemy.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.317}, {"text": "We are not literally\ntransforming pizzainto cookies.That would be kind of cool,\nbut we're not doing that.That's somewhere\nelse at MIT, OK?But it's effectively\ndoing the same thing.What we're doing is, given that\nwe have a fixed amount of moneyand given that we're\ngoing to spend it all,the more you spend on pizza,\nthe less you spend on cookies.So you're effectively\ntransforming pizzainto cookies and vice\nversa because you'regoing to spend all your money.You've got to spend\nit on something.So, the more you spend on one,\nthe less you get of another.So, through the\nbudget constraint,we are effectively transforming\none good to the other.By having more of one, we're\ngetting less of the other.So that's the sense\nin which we callit the marginal rate\nof transportation--of transformation.So, basically, this comes\nback to the key conceptwe talked about in the very\nfirst lecture, opportunitycost.The opportunity cost of a\nslice of pizza is two cookies.Remember, opportunity\ncost is the valueof the next best\nalternative, OK?The opportunity cost is\nthe next best alternative.Well, here you only have\ntwo alternatives, pizzaand cookies.So the opportunity cost of a\nslice of pizza is two cookies.And that's the sense\nin which you'retransforming pizza into cookies\nor cookies into pizza, OK?Now this seems kind of\nabstract, but let's actuallythink of an organization\nwhich has taken this principleto heart to develop the\nbest method of weight lossin America, which is Weight\nWatchers, OK, Weight Watchers.Now it turns out that\ndieting is super hardand basically doesn't work, OK?There's a large\nliterature, whichsays that people go\non diets all the time.Then they stop them, and\nthey gain the weight back.OK, dieting is incredibly hard\nand basically doesn't work, OK?But a much more\nsuccessful approachhas been established\nby Weight Watchers.It's not the only\napproach, but it'sbeen proven much\nmore successful, OK?", "start": 360.0,

you might consume.You go on the website,\nand everythingin the world you might want\nto eat has a point value.They then ask, well, what\nweight are you today?What's your age and gender?That stuff matters\nfor weight loss.And what weight do\nyou want achieve?And they say, if you\nwant to achieve a weightloss of x over y\ndays, then you'vegot to limit\nyourself to z points.So, essentially, your\ngoal is to lose weight.So we're going to give\nyou the budget constraint.We're not going to\ntell you what to eat.That's why it's\nbetter than dietingbecause, once again,\nAdam Smith was right.People like to have choices.They like to let\nchoice drive things.But we are going to\ntell you a total budget.So, for example, vegetables\nare like zero points.Snickers bars are like\nsix points, et cetera.They have various\npoint systems, OK?So, for example, suppose your\nbudget is 30 points, whichwould be pretty typical, OK?Suppose you go to\nMcDonald's for lunch,and you get a number one.The number one at\nMcDonald's is a Big Mac,which has 14 points, fries,\nwhich have 10 points,and a Coke, which\nhas six points.That's 30 points, and\nit's only lunch, OK?You've blown your whole\nbudget for the day on lunch.Now you could just get\ndepressed and say screw it.I'll just be fat.But, clearly, looking\naround the room,you guys have not\nmade that choice.Or you could look at\nthe budget constraintand say, well, what\nelse can I get.Well, it turns out you can\nget a 10-piece nugget, whichis 12 points, apple\nslices, which is one point,and a Diet Coke,\nwhich is zero points,for a total of only 13 points.Now you have 13 points and\nplenty of room for dinner.Now, to be honest,\nanyone who tells youthat second lunch is as good as\nthat first lunch is a liar, OK?I'd much rather a Big Mac and\nfries and a Coke than nuggetsand apple slice and Diet Coke.Give me a break.But I'd also much\nrather have dinner, OK?", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.178}, {"text": "So, basically, this lets\nyou make the trade-offby imposing a budget\nconstraint, by settingrelative prices across goods.The points are like utils.They're not meaningful.They're only\nmeaningful relatively.It lets you set relative\nprices across goodsand then it lets\nyou, essentially,optimize across those various--across those various goods.So budget constraints,\nessentially,by setting up this marginal\nrate of transformation,can help with a lot of\nkind of decisions in life.OK, questions about that?OK, now what happens if we\nshock the budget constraint?So we talked about\nconstructing them.What about shocking\nthe budget constraint?We're going to do a lot\nin this class of whatwe call comparative statics,\nwhich is, essentially,making changes in\none thing or anotherand seeing what it\ndoes to the system.So let's talk about shocking\nthe budget constraint.Let's start first with\na change in prices.Suppose the price of pizza\ngoes from $12 up to $18.This is a really good\nslice of pizza, OK?Well, what happens to\nthe budget constraint?Let's look at figure 3-2.Figure 3-2 shows what happens.You have your original\nbudget constraint BC1.The equation of that line is\n12P plus 6C equals 72, OK?The price of pizza and the\nnumber of slices of pizzaplus the price of cookies\ntimes the number of cookiesequals 72.Now the price of\npizza has gone up.What that's done is that has\npivoted inward your budgetconstraint to BC2.It has flattened the\nbudget constraintbecause the slope,\nremember, is the ratioof the price of cookies to\nthe price of pizza, right?That's a ratio.Well, that ratio\nhas just fallen.It used to be a 1/2.Now it's a 1/3.Negative 1/2-- well,\nit used to be a half.Now it's a 1/3.So the slope has fallen from\nnegative 1/2 to negative 1/3.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.347}, {"text": "So what's happened is you can\nstill have as many cookiesas you had before.The y-intercept has\nnot changed, but youcan have fewer slices of pizza.That's why it's a pivot\nbecause one price has notchanged, only the other price.So it's a pivot inward.The other thing\nhere, you'll noticewe have all these funny\ndots and stuff, OK?That represents\nwhat has happenedto what we call your opportunity\nset, your opportunityset, which is an\nimportant concept, OK?Your opportunity set is the\nset of choices available to yougiven your income\nand market prices,the set of choices available\nto you given your incomeand market prices.So your opportunity\nset initiallywas the black dots\nplus the red dots.Now your opportunity\nset has shrunk.Your opportunity set is\nnow just the black dots.Given your income,\nyou can now getless stuff, same amount of\ncookies, but less pizza.And you are worse off.Your opportunity set has shrunk.Your opportunity set-- even\nthough your parents are stillsending you the same check, you\nare worse off because you cannow buy less pizza with it, OK?So that's what happens\nto the opportunity setwhen a price changes.And, likewise, you\nshould show to yourselfthe same thing will happen when\nthe price of cookies change.In that case, you'll\nget an increasein the steepness of the\nbudget constraint, OK?But your opportunity\nset will still--your opportunity set\nwill still shrink, OK?Now what about-- yeah?AUDIENCE: Don't we not\ncare about all the dotsbelow the line, though,\nbecause we're assumingwe're spending all the money?JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,\nthat's a good point,and we're going to\ncome back to that.We haven't-- we assume they're\nspending all their money,but it's just a way\nof representing.You could think of the line\nbeing lower as the same thing.We care about-- we just\ncare about the areabecause it represents the\nset, but you're right.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.44}, {"text": "You could just focus\non the line and saythe line is everywhere lower.So they're worse off.That's another\nway to look at it.But we like to think\nabout as a set.It comes in handy later\nfor various reasons, OK?But that's a good question.Now let's ask about\na second thing.What if your income goes up?What if prices are\nback to 12 and 6,but your parents decide\nto send you more money?Suppose your parents--\nor send you less money.It turns out you haven't\nbeen paying enough attentionin 14.01.You're parents are mad.They're monitoring you.That's why we have\nthe camera here.This goes directly to\nall your parents, OK?I'm sort of joking.And so let's say parents cut\nyour allowance to $60, OK?Well, what does that do?That's in figure 3-3.OK, in figure 3-3, the\nold budget constraintwas that you get\npizzas and cookiesat a price of $6 and $12,\nand you could get themuntil you spend $72.Now you can only get\nthem until you spend $60.Now what we see is not a pivot\nin the budget constraint,but an inward shift in\nthe budget constraint,because the relative\nprice of pizza and cookieshas not changed.Therefore, the slope\nhasn't changed.OK, the slope is\ndictated solely--you don't do anything\nto control the slope.The market controls\nthe slope, OK?But you and your family\ncontrol the level,and the level has shrunk.So you're pivoting inwards, OK?And, once again,\nnow, instead of beingable to buy say 12\ncookies and six pizzas,now you can only buy say\n10 cookies and five pizzas.That's the most you can get, OK?So, once again, your opportunity\nset has been restricted,but in a different kind of way\nthrough this pivot inward, OK?So that's how we\nsort of manipulatethese budget constraints.And we're going to come\nback to that next lecture.That'll be important.Yeah?AUDIENCE: So, in looking\nat the differences,can like an increase\nin the price of pizzaor like a decrease\nin your budget--is it more showing that\nlike the change in slopesdoesn't really\naffect you if you'relike say buying more\ncookies than pizza?", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.385}, {"text": "But like, in terms of if\nyour budget as a wholedecreases, then it\naffects you overall.JONATHAN GRUBER: That's\na great question,and we're going to actually\nanswer that questionnext lecture very explicitly.So hold on to that\nquestion, and we'lltalk about we're going\nto compare explicitlywhy income changes\ndiffer from price changesand what are the\nunderlying mechanisms.Yeah?AUDIENCE: How do you\ndetermine your marginal rateof transformation?How do determine your--\nlike say it wasn't justpizza and cookies.Like say it was more products.How would you\ndetermine that value?JONATHAN GRUBER:\nGreat, great question.So, as I said, we\nalways are goingto start with simplifying\nassumptions to make life easy.There's no reason\nthat this couldn'tbe written in three dimensions.And you'd have\nrelative marginal ratesof transformation, rates at\nwhich you're willing to tradeoff various things.So you could just extend\nthe math in all dimensions.It wouldn't add any\nrichness, and it'd justmake your head spin.But the basic-- so\nall the

conditionsin your constrained\noptimization.That's the way to\nthink about it.OK, so let's-- actually,\nthat's a great segue.Let's turn to the\nsecond part, whichis how we use budget\nconstraints and the utilityfunction we learned about\nlast time to actually describehow consumers make choices.So we're going to take utility.Remember, I said\nlast time consumersare going to maximize their\nutility subject to a budgetconstraint.Well, now we've taught\nyou about utility.We've taught you about\nbudget constraints.Let's put them together, OK?How to consume-- how do\nconsumers put them together?Well, graphically, the\nrepresentation of preferenceswas our indifference curves.That represented\npeople's indifferencewith further out\nindifference curvesmade people happy, right?That was last time.So, essentially, what we're\ngoing to ask graphicallyis what is the\nhighest indifferencecurve you can achieve\ngiven your budget, right?We know you want to be that\nhighest indifference curvepossible by more is better.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.571}, {"text": "So we're simply\ngoing to ask whatis the highest\nindifference curve you canreach given your budget, OK?So let's consider the same\nutility from last time.Utility is square\nroot of P times C, OK?And let's consider the same\nbudget we wrote down up here--$72 income, $12 price of\npizza, $6 price of cookies.And now let's ask where\ncan you go with that.So let's turn to figure\n3-4 and do it graphically.We'll do it mathematically\nin a minute, OK?So, in figure 3-4, you\nhave our budget constraint,which runs from 6\npizzas to 12 cookies.That's the original\nbudget constraint.And you have a series\nof indifference curves.And these indifference\ncurves, I1, I2, I3, I4,they all come directly\nfrom this utility

you--\nyou'll drive on Fridayhow you take this\nutility functionand literally can draw the\nindifference curves from it,OK?But, for now, take my word\nthat these indifference curvesrepresent this utility function.And what we see is that\npoint D is the furthest outindifference curve you\ncan achieve while stillmeeting your budget, while still\nmeeting your budget constraint.And, therefore, we say that\nthe optimum, graphically,is the tangency between\nyour indifference curveand your budget constraint is\nthe optimal constrained bundle.You see how we brought--last time, we talked about\nfurther out indifference curvesmake you happier.Today, we talked about\nthe fact that you'relimited by your budget.So we have the furthest\nindifference curveyou can get to is going\nto be,

point A better?Why isn't it better\nto have two-- maybeyou just-- maybe you\nlike cookies a lotand don't like--\nor like pizza a lotand don't like\ncookies that much.How can we say that point\nD is

indifference curve.Well, fine.Same person, by that logic,\nwhy not choose point E?AUDIENCE: It's above the budget.JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,\nyou can't afford it.So the bottom line is\nyou can see graphicallywhy the tangency is\nthe best you're going--is the best you're going to do.OK, likewise, point C\nyou wouldn't choose.Point C has the same slope.It has the same\nslope as point D.In other words, the slope\nis minus 1/2 at point C.You've drew a line tangent\nto point C.

indifferencecurves so there is none\nthat hit the tangent?Do you just go for one that's\nlike the most tangent I guess?JONATHAN GRUBER: We're going\nto come to-- we're going to--well, first of all,\nwe're not goingto have discrete indifference.We could have lines, and\nthe lines could end up--you could end up lying along.You could end up lying along a\nbudget constraint for example.Or you could have--you could even have\nutility functions,which just touch a\nbudget constraintat one extreme or another.And we'll talk\nabout those cases.Yeah?AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]\nutility functiongo

some\noriginal budget line,which is labeled\nthere original budgetline, that runs from 5,000\nin food to 5,000 in shelter.And then you can have some of\nin between, some along the way,OK?Now let's say we give\nsomeone $500 in cash.Obviously, this graph\nis not to scale, OK?It looks like you're doubling\nhis income, but it's only $500.This just sort of makes it\neasier, a not to scale graph.Let's

assume\nthe markets are perfectlyfunctioning.So there's no-- you're imposing\nsort of a market failure.If there's no market-- once\nthere's market failures,all bets are off.But, with no

predictions,which are uncertain.Here we have an uncertain\nprediction from theory aboutwhether food stamps will\naffect food purchases or not.So let's test it.And the way we test\nit is we actuallyhave run food stamps cash out\nexperiments where we literallytake guys on food stamps\nand give them cash insteadand watch what happens to their\nconsumption before and after.It's a real randomized trial.We literally flip a coin.Heads, you keep\nyour food stamps.Tails, we replace\nthose food stampswith an equal amount of cash.Then we watch what happens.What happens is that

countries,in Africa in particular,\nsome in the US.And they find that people\nspend relatively littleof that on drugs and\nalcohol, but they actuallytend to spend it productively.And, in fact, they found,\nin developing countries,this often provides valuable\nresources for individualsto start businesses.So they ran experiment Uganda\nwhere a nonprofit companyrandomly offered\na group of women$150, which is huge\nrelative to their income.That's 50% to 100% of annual\nincome in Uganda, $150.And what they found was, after\ntwo months-- after 18 months,these women had used that\nmoney to
