[{"text": "I grew up with my identical twin,who was an incredibly loving brother.Now, one thing about being a twin is,it makes you an expert\nat spotting favoritism.If his cookie was even\nslightly bigger than my cookie,I had questions.And clearly, I wasn't starving.(Laughter)When I became a psychologist,\nI began to notice favoritismof a different kind;and that is, how much more we value\nthe body than we do the mind.I spent nine years at university\nearning my doctorate in psychology,and I can't tell you how many people\nlook at my business card and say,\"Oh -- a psychologist.\nSo, not a real doctor,\"as if it should say that on my card.[Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist\n(Not a Real Doctor)](Laughter)This favoritism we show the body\nover the mind --I see it everywhere.I recently was at a friend's house,and their five-year-old\nwas getting ready for bed.He was standing on a stool\nby the sink, brushing his teeth,when he slipped and scratched his leg\non the stool when he fell.He cried for a minute,\nbut then he got back up,got back on the stool, and reached out\nfor a box of Band-Aidsto put one on his cut.Now, this kid could barely\ntie his shoelaces,but he knew you have to cover a cut\nso it doesn't become infected,and you have to care for your teeth\nby brushing twice a day.We all know how to maintain\nour physical healthand how to practice dental hygiene,

children\nabout emotional hygiene?Nothing.How is it that we spend more time\ntaking care of our teeththan we do our minds?Why is it that our physical health\nis so much more important to usthan our psychological health?We sustain psychological injuries\neven more often than we do physical ones,injuries like failure\nor rejection or loneliness.And they can also get worse\nif we ignore them,and they can impact our lives\nin dramatic ways.And yet, even though there are\nscientifically proven techniqueswe could use to treat these\nkinds of psychological injuries,we don't.It doesn't even occur to us\nthat we should.\"Oh, you're feeling depressed?\nJust shake it off; it's all in your head.\"Can you imagine saying that\nto somebody with a broken leg:\"Oh, just walk it off;\nit's all in your leg.\"(Laughter)It is time we closed the gapbetween our physical\nand our psychological health.It's time we made them more equal,more like twins.Speaking of which,\nmy brother is also a psychologist.So he's not a real doctor, either.(Laughter)We didn't study together, though.In fact, the hardest thing\nI've ever done in my lifeis move across the Atlantic\nto New York Cityto get my

my room,\nwaiting for him to call --and waiting ...and waiting.But the phone didn't ring.Given the time difference, I assumed,\"OK, he's out with friends,\nhe'll call later.\"There were no cell phones then.But he didn't.And I began to realize\nthat after being away for over 10 months,he no longer missed me\nthe way I missed him.I knew he would call in the morning,but that night was one of the saddest\nand longest nights of my life.I woke up the next morning.I glanced down at the phone,and I realized\nI had kicked it off the hookwhen pacing the day before.I stumbled out of bed,I put the phone back on the receiver,\nand it rang a second later.And it was my brother,and boy, was he pissed.(Laughter)It was the saddest and longest\nnight of his life as well.Now, I tried to explain\nwhat happened, but he said,\"I don't understand.If you saw I wasn't calling you,why didn't you just pick up\nthe phone and call me?\"He was right.Why didn't I call him?I didn't have an answer then.But I do today,and it's a simple one:loneliness.Loneliness creates a deep\npsychological wound,one that distorts our perceptions\nand scrambles our thinking.It makes us believe that those around us\ncare much less than they actually do.It make us really afraid to reach out,", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.33}, {"text": "because why set yourself up\nfor rejection and heartachewhen your heart is already aching\nmore than you can stand?I was in the grips\nof real loneliness back then,but I was surrounded by people all day,\nso it never occurred to me.But loneliness is defined\npurely subjectively.It depends solely on whether you feel\nemotionally or socially disconnectedfrom those around you.And I did.There is a lot of research on loneliness,\nand all of it is horrifying.Loneliness won't just make you miserable;it will kill you.I'm not kidding.Chronic loneliness increases\nyour likelihood of an early deathby 14 percent.Fourteen percent!Loneliness causes high blood pressure,high cholesterol.It even suppress the functioning\nof your immune system,making you vulnerable to all kinds\nof illnesses and diseases.In fact, scientists have concluded\nthat taken together,chronic loneliness\nposes as significant a riskfor your long-term health and longevityas cigarette smoking.Now, cigarette packs come with warnings\nsaying, \"This could kill you.\"But loneliness doesn't.And that's why it's so importantthat we prioritize\nour psychological health,that we practice emotional hygiene.Because you can't treat\na psychological woundif you don't even know you're injured.Loneliness isn't the only\npsychological woundthat distorts our perceptions\nand misleads us.Failure does that as well.I once visited a day care center,where I saw three toddlers\nplay with identical plastic toys.You had to slide the red button,\nand a cute doggie would pop out.One little girl tried pulling\nthe purple button, then pushing it,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.328}, {"text":

it.Meanwhile, another little girl\ntried everything she could think ofuntil she slid the red button,the cute doggie popped out,\nand she squealed with delight.So: three toddlers\nwith identical plastic toys,but with very different\nreactions to failure.The first two toddlers were perfectly\ncapable of sliding a red button.The only thing that prevented\nthem from succeedingwas that their mind tricked them\ninto believing they could not.Now, adults get tricked this way\nas well, all the time.In fact, we all have a default set\nof feelings and beliefsthat gets triggered whenever\nwe encounter frustrations and setbacks.Are you aware of how\nyour mind reacts to failure?You need to be.Because if your mind tries to convince you\nyou're incapable of something,and you believe it,then like those two toddlers,\nyou'll begin to feel helplessand you'll stop trying too soon,\nor you won't even try at all.And then you'll be even more\nconvinced you can't succeed.You see, that's why so many people\nfunction below their actual potential.Because somewhere along the way,\nsometimes a single failureconvinced them that they couldn't\nsucceed, and they believed it.Once we become convinced of something,\nit's very difficult to change our mind.I learned that lesson the hard way\nwhen I was a teenager with my brother.We were driving with friends\ndown a dark road at night,when a police car stopped us.There had been a robbery in the area\nand they were looking for suspects.The officer approached the car,\nand shined his flashlight on the driver,then on my brother in the front seat,and then on me.And his eyes opened wide and he said,\"Where have I seen your face before?\"(Laughter)", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.199}, {"text": "And I said,\"In the front seat.\"(Laughter)But

have a police record,could I show him\nI had a twin in the front seat.But even as we were driving away,you could see by the look\non his face he was convincedthat I was getting away with something.(Laughter)Our mind is hard to change\nonce we become convinced.So it might be very natural\nto feel demoralizedand defeated after you fail.But you cannot allow yourself\nto become convinced you can't succeed.You have to fight\nfeelings of helplessness.You have to gain control\nover the situation.And you have to break\nthis kind of negative cyclebefore it begins.[Stop Emotional

man stands up and says,\"I'm not interested,\" and walks out.Rejection is extremely painful.The woman was so hurt she couldn't move.All she could do was call a friend.Here's what the friend

something we all do,especially after a rejection.We all start thinking of all our faults\nand all our shortcomings,what we wish we were,\nwhat we wish we weren't.We call ourselves names.Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it.And it's interesting that we do,because our self-esteem\nis already hurting.Why would we want to go\nand damage it even further?We wouldn't make a physical injury\nworse on
