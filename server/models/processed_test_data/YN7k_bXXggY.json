And we're going to\nstart with a fairly basic one.So what's the thing about\nmax-min problems?The main thing is that we're\nasking you to do a little bitmore of the interpretation of\nword problems. So many of theproblems are expressed\nin terms of words.And so, in this case, we have\na wire which is length 1.Cut into two pieces.And then each piece\nencloses a square.Sorry, encloses a square.And the problem - so\nthis is the setup.And the problem is to find the\nlargest area enclosed.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So here's the problem.Now, in all of these cases, in\nall these cases, there's abunch of words.And your job is typically\nto draw a diagram.So the first thing you want to\ndo is to draw a diagram.In this case, it can be\nfairly schematic.Here's your unit length.And when you draw the diagram,\nyou're going tohave to pick variables.So those are really the\ntwo main tasks.To set up the problem.So you're drawing a diagram.This is like word problems of\nold, in grade school throughhigh school.Draw a diagram and name\nthe variables.So we'll be doing a\nlot of that today.So here's my unit length.And I'm going to choose the\nvariable x to be the length ofone of the pieces of wire.And that makes the other\npiece 1 - x.And that's pretty much the whole\ndiagram, except thatthere's something that we\ndid with the wire afterwe cut it in half.Namely, we built two little\nboxes out of it.Like this, these are\nour squares.And their side lengths are\nx / 4 and (1 - x) / 4.So, so far, so good.And now we have to think, well,\nwe want to find thelargest area.So I need a formula for area\nin terms of variables thatI've described.And so that's the last thing.I'll give the letter a as\nthe label for the area.And then the area is just\nthe square of x/4 + thesquare of 1 - x.Whoops, that strange\n2 got in here.Over 4.So far, so good.Now, The instinct that you'll\nhave, and I'm going to yield", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.124}, {"text": "to that instinct, is we should\ncharge ahead and justdifferentiate.Alright?That's alright.We'll find the critical\npoints.So we know that those are\nimportant points.So we're going to find\nthe critical points.In other words, we take the\nderivative we set, thederivative of a with\nrespect to x = 0.So if I do that differentiation,\nI get the,well, so the first one,\nx^2 / 16, that's 8.Sorry.That's x / 8, right?That's a derivative of this.And if I differentiate this, I\nget well, the derivative of 1- x ^2 is 2 ( 1 - x)( a - 1).So it's - (1 - x) / 8.So there are two minus signs in\nthere, I'll let you ponderthat differentiation, which\nI did by the chain rule.Hang on a sec, OK?Just wait until we're done.So here's the derivative.Is there a problem?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Right, so there's\na 1/16 here.This is x^2 / 16.And so it's 2x / 8,\nover 16, sorry.Which has an 8.That's OK.Alright, so now, This is equal\nto 0 if and only if x = 1 -

so why is it that we\ncall it the minimum point?We have this word, critical\npoint, which is what x = 1/2is in critical value.And so I'm making those same\ndistinctions here.But there's another notion of\na minimum point, and this isan alternative if you like.The minimum point is the\npoint (1/2, 1/32).Right, that's a point\non the graph.It's the point -

And the\nanswer is, yes we can.In fact, you can actually also\nstare at this and see thatit's a sum of squares.So it's always curving up.It's a parabola with a positive\nsecond coefficient.So you can differentiate\nthis twice.If you do you'll get\n1/8 + another 1/8and you'll get 1/16.So the second derivative\nis 1/16.Is 1/4.And that's an acceptable\nway of figuring it out.I'll mention the second\nderivative test again, in thissecond example.So let me talk about\na second example.So again, this is going to\nbe another question.STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: The question is, when\nI say minimum or maximumpoint which will I mean.STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: So I just repeated\nthe question.So the question is,\nwhen I say minimumpoint, what will I mean?OK?", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.287}, {"text": "And the answer is that for the\npurposes of this class I willprobably avoid saying that.But I will say, probably, where\nis the minimum achieved.Just in order to avoid that.If I actually sat at I often am\nreferring to the graph, andI mean this.And in fact, when you get your\nlittle review for the secondexam, I'll say exactly that\non the review sheet.And I'll make this very clear\nwhen we were doing this.However, I just want to prepare\nyou for the fact thatin real life, and even me when\nI'm talking colloquially, whenI say what's the minimum point\nof something, I might actuallybe mixing it up with this\nother notion here.So let's do another example.So this is an example to get\nus used to the notion ofconstraints.So we have, so consider\na box without a top.Or, if you like, we're going to\nfind the box without a top.With least surface area\nfor a fixed volume.Find the box without a top with\nleast surface area for afixed volume.The procedure for working this\nout is the following.You make this diagram.And you set up the variables.In this case, we're going to\nhave four names of variables.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.36}, {"text": "We have four letters that\nwe have to choose.And we'll choose them\nin a kind of astandard way, alright?So first I have to tell\nyou one more thing.Which is something that we could\ncalculate separately butI'm just going to give\nit to you in advance.Which is that it turns\nout that the best boxhas a square bottom.And that's going to get rid of\none of our variables for us.So it's got a square bottom,\nand so let's drawa picture of it.So here's our box.Well, that goes down like this,\nalmost.
