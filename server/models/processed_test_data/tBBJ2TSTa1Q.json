derivative\nis an importantthing to know, especially in\nproblems with maximum andminimum, which is the big\napplication of derivatives, tolocate a maximum or a minimum,\nand to decide which one it is.And I can tell you right away,\nlocating a maximum, minimum,is the first derivative's job.The first derivative is 0.If I have a maximum or a\nminimum, and we'll havepictures, somewhere in the\nmiddle of my function I'llrecognize by derivative\nequals 0.Slope equals 0, that the\nfunction is leveling off,either bending down or bending\nup, maximum or minimum.OK, and it's the second\nderivative thattells me which it is.The second derivative tells me\nthe bending of the graph.OK, so we now will have\nthree generations.The big picture of calculus\nstarted with two

and you sayd second f dt squared.d second f dt squared.OK, so that's you could say the\nphysics example: distance,speed, acceleration.And I say physics because, of\ncourse, acceleration is the ain Newton's Law f equals ma.For a graph, like these graphs\nhere, I won't especially usethose physics words.I'll use graph words.So I would say function\none would be theheight of the graph.And in this case, that height is\ny equals x squared, so it'sa simple parabola.Here would be the slope.I would use the word \"slope\"\nfor the second function.And the slope of y equals x\nsquared we know is 2x,

positive.It's slope is positive.And its second derivative--bending--is positive.And that gives us a function\nthat goes like that.Now, let me go to a different\nfunction.Let me take a second
