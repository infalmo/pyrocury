[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Superposition is very\nunusual and very interesting.Now we've said\nabout superpositionthat in classical physics, when\nwe talk about superpositionwe have electric fields, and\nyou add the electric fields,and the total electric field\nis the sum of electric fields,and it's an electric field.And there's nothing\nstrange about it.The nature of superposition\nin quantum mechanicsis very strange.So nature of superposition--I will illustrate it in a\ncouple of different ways.One way is with a device that\nwe will get accustomed to.It it's called the\nMach-Zehnder interferometer,which is a device with\na beam splitter in here.You send in a beam of light--input- beam splitter\nand then the light--indeed half of it gets\nreflected, half of itgets transmitted.Then you put the mirror here--mirror 1, you put\nthe mirror 2 here,and this gets recombined\ninto another beam splitter.And then if there would\nbe just a light going in,here there would be\ntwo things going out.There's another one\ncoming from the bottom.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.385}, {"text": "There will be two.There will be interference.So you put a detector\nD0 here and a detectorE1 here to detect the light.So that's the sketch of the\nMach-Zehnder interferometer--beam splitters and mirrors.Take a beam, spit the light, go\ndown, up, and then recombine itand go into detectors.This was invented\nby these two people,independently, in the 1890s--'91 to '92 apparently.And people did this with light--beams of light before they\nrealized they're photons.And what happens with a beam\nof light-- it's interesting--comes a beam of light.The beam splitter sends half\nof the light one way halfof the light the other way.You already know with\nquantum mechanicsthat's going to be probabilistic\nsome photons will go up maybesome photons will go down\nor something more strangecan happen.If you have a\nsuperposition, some photonsmay go both up and down.So that's what can happen\nin quantum mechanics.If you send the beam,\nclassical physics,it divides half and\nhalf and then combines.And there's an\ninterference effect here.And we will design this\ninterferometer in such a way", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.204}, {"text": "that sometimes we can produce\nan interference that everythinggoes to D0 or\neverything goes to D1or we can produce suitable\ninterferences that wecan get fractions of the\npower going into D1 and D2--D0 and D1.So we can do it\nin different ways,but we should think of\nthis as a single photon.Single photos going\none at a time.You see, whatever light you\nput in here, experimentally,the same frequency\ngoes out here.So what is interference?You might think, intuitively,\nthat interferenceis one photon interfering with\nanother one, but it can't be.If two photos would interfere\nin a canceling, destructiveinterference, you will\nhave a bunch of energy.It goes into nothing.It's impossible.If they would interfere\nconstructively,you would add the\nelectric fieldsand the amplitude would be\nfour times as big because it'sproportional to the square.But two photos are not\ngoing to go to four photons.It cannot conserve energy.So first of all, when you\nget light interference,each photon is\ninterfering with itself.It sounds crazy, but it's\nthe only possibility.They cannot interfere\nwith each other.You can send the\nphotons one at a timeand, therefore, each\nphoton will haveto be in both beams\nat the same time.And then, each photon\nas it goes along,there will be an\ninterference effect,and the photon may end\nup here or end up therein a probabilistic way.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.232}, {"text": "So you have an example\nof superposition.Superposition.A single photon\nstate a single photonis equal to superposition of\na photon in the upper beamand a photon in the lower beam.It's like two different states--a little different\nfrom here, youhad photons in two\ndifferent polarizationsstates superposed.Here you have photons\nin two different beams--a single photon is in both\nbeams at the same time.And unless you have that, you\ncannot get a superpositionand an interference that is\nconsistent with experiment.So what does that mean\nfor superpositions?Well, it means something\nthat we can discuss,and I can say things\nthat, at this moment,may not make too\nmuch sense, but itwould be a good idea that you\nthink about them a little bit.We associated\nstates with vectors.States and vectors\nare the same thing.And it so happens that\nwhen you have vectors,you can write them as\nthe sum of other vectors.So the sum of these two\nvectors may be this vector.But you can also write it as\nthe sum of these two vectors--these two vectors\nadd to the state.And you can write any vector\nas a sum of different vectors,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.167}, {"text": "and that's, actually,\nquite relevant.You will be doing that\nduring the semester--writing a state a superposition\nof different things.And in that way\nyou will understandthe physics of those states.So for example, we can\nthink of two states--A and B. And you see, as I\nsaid, states wave functions,vectors--we're all calling\nthem the same thing.If you have a superposition\nof the states A and B,what can happen?All right, we'll do\nit the following way.Let's assume if you\nmeasure some property on A,you always get value A. So you\nmeasure something-- position,momentum, angular momentum,\nspin, energy, something--on A, it states\nthat you always getA. Suppose you measured the\nsame property on B. You alwaysget B as the value.And now suppose you have a\nquantum mechanical state,and the state is\nalpha A plus beta B--it's a superposition.This is your state.You superimpose A and B. And\nnow you measure that property.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.133}, {"text": "That same property you\ncould measure here,you measure it in your state.The question is,\nwhat will you get?You've now superimpose\nthose states.On the first state, you always\nget A; on the second state,you always get B. What do you\nget on the superimposed states,where alpha and\nbeta are numbers--complex numbers in general?Well the most, perhaps,\nimmediate guessis that you would get\nsomething in-betweenmaybe alpha A plus beta B\nor an average or something.But no, that's not what\nhappens in quantum mechanics.In quantum mechanics, you always\nget A or you always get B.So you can do the\nexperiment many times,and you will get A many times,\nand you may get B many times.But you never get\nsomething intermediate.So this is very different\nthan in classical physics.If a wave has some\namplitudes and youadd another wave of\ndifferent amplitudes,you measure the energy you\nget something intermediate.Here not!You make the superposition and\nas you measure you will eitherget the little a\nor the little b butwith different probabilities.So roughly speaking, the\nprobability to get little ais proportional to the number in\nfront of here is alpha squared,and the probability\nto measure little bis proportional to beta squared.So in a quantum superposition,\na single measurement", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.226}, {"text": "doesn't yield an average result\nor an intermediate result.It leads one or the other.And this should\nconnect with this.Think of the photon we\nwere talking about before.If you think of the photon\nthat was at an anglealpha in this way, you could say\nthat the polarizer is measuringthe polarization of the object.And therefore, what\nis the possible resultit may measure the\npolarizations say oh, if it'sin the x direction\nyou get it right,and what is the\nprobability that you getit to be in the x direction is\nproportional to cosine squaredalpha-- the coefficient\nhere squared.So the probability that\nyou find the photonafter measuring\nin the x directionis closer in squared\nalpha, and the probabilitythat you'll find that here\nis sine squared alpha.And after you measure,\nyou get this state whichis to say the following thing.The probability to get the\nvalue A is alpha squared,but if you get A,\nthe state becomes Abecause this whole state\nof the system becomes that.Because successive measurements\nwill keep giving you the valueA. If you get B,\nthe state becomesB.
