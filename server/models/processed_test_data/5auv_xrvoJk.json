feedback whatyou wanted to do in the class.We're going to go through that\nand talk about the readings.I'm going to do a\nlittle calling on youand helping you take the\nclass through the readings.And then the six or seven\nthings I'm going to do--history of money; ledgers;\nfiat currency, central banks,and credit cards;\nthe role of money;some early digital money.You had the Clark reading as\nto a bunch of failed attempts.All the way through a\nlittle bit of mobile money,all the way up to\nStarbucks and Alipay.And yet, the riddle remains.We're going to get\nreally deep into Bitcoinin the next three classes.But this is to give\nsome foundationalbits of money and ledgers and\ncentral banking and technology.And then, of course,\nI always liketo finish the class\ntalking a little bitabout why we're doing what we're\ndoing between now and then.Even though the\nreadings are required,I know you're all busy.I know that you've all\ngot a bunch of classes.And like good business\nstudents and business people,you optimize.So I'm trying to give you a\nsense of why you might read it,rather than it's required,\nat the end of each classand how it fits into\nthe course narrative.And then we'll do a\nlittle bit of conclusions.So the survey results.What did you want to learn?This is really\nyour class, and I'mgoing to learn as much from you.But hopefully, we're going\nto cover what you want.So here's a list of those things\nthat were at least writtenby two of you.First was technical things.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.296}, {"text": "18 of you said understanding\nblockchain

lot\nabout applications.How can you actually apply it,\nlearning in the venture spaceand thinking about where it\nreally works in the world.And I think we're going\nto spend a lot of timeon that in the second half.But all throughout,\nwe're going to betalking about the\neconomics and what'sthe reality versus the hype.You also wanted to understand\nits impact on people's lives,the regulation.About six of you said\nsomething about regulation.I'm glad, because we're only\ndoing one lecture on that.But we're going\nto spread it out,because as we talked\nabout in our first class--and I'm honored\nLarry's here again--but we're going to always be\nthinking about Larry's fourways.And I see-- is it Jihei?What are Larry Lessig's--you shook your head yes.AUDIENCE: I know-- let's see.It is code and architecture,\nmarket, law, and norms.PROFESSOR: You got it.Does anybody want to say how\nthat relates to blockchain,why we're chatting about that?Oh, my god, I'm going to

you\nrepeat the question?PROFESSOR: Jihei, you're\ngoing to repeat the question,because you went through it.AUDIENCE: So how does\nLarry's four forces relateto our topic of blockchain.PROFESSOR: And the four\nforces, again, are market,so business; law;\ncode or architecture,call it technology;\nand social norms.AUDIENCE: So I think\nit's because itbrings a new way of\ndoing those things,like a new tool in order to--so what I got from the reading\nis these ledgers alreadyexisted, but given that now\nwe have big data, for example,then more things going on helps\nour society roll it out better.PROFESSOR: Good way to say it.Look, it's unfair of me.It wasn't one of the readings.I'm just saying, in\neverything in life,I find these things grind\nup against each other.I spent a lot of time in\nWashington in politics,but the markets and how\nthe commercial enterpriseand the economy grinds up\nagainst technology and sortof grinds up against the law--and then, of course, just\nsocial normative behavior.These four forces, in almost\neverything one does in life,you will find.And so I just ask you\nto always, whether it's", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "one reading or

disciplineto think, OK, what are\nthe commercial realities,the markets?What's the technology, even\nif it's in an earlier dayand it's the technology of\nthe car replacing the horseand carriage?How does government\nor the official sectorput it into a set of\nstandards that are required?And then how do\nwe, as a society,even if it's not required,\njust have our behaviors?Those are the four forces.So that's why.I probably just\nfailed Larry's class,but that's how I've\nthought about it.I did, probably, right?No, he's shaking his head.But regulation is just\none of those four forces.And that's why I pause there.And so we'll have it in every\nclass, but only one lecture.Money and markets, that's\none of the other forces.Five of you said you\nwant to make money,and I applaud those

question,but I think historically,\nit was pay offdebts, starting and conquering\nvarious lands and wards,and then also funding\ntrade wars, cutting taxes.So a lot of societal things\nthat drove

years ago or 8,000or 10,000 years ago.Really, it's a social\nconsensus mechanism.But we're going to chat about\nthe readings in a minuteand come back to that question.What is fiat currency?Does

it has\nno inherent value.AUDIENCE: Terry.PROFESSOR: Terry.AUDIENCE: Well,\nactually, the sameapplies to any commodity\nthat's used to--currency in general.Because it's just the scarcity\nof some

question\nthat's been debatedfor decades or centuries.How many are more\nin Sean's camp?AUDIENCE: I think it depends.For example, gold is\ndefinitely a social construct.We decide that, as\na human society,that gold is going to\nbe something valuable.But if it's, like, grains\nthat humans can [INAUDIBLE]and that, I think,\nhas an inherent value.So I think there are\nnon-fiat currencies thatdoes

hasn't\nraised their hand yet?No?All right.AUDIENCE: I think that's\nmaybe my earlier comment.It can be used to settle\ndebts, and specificallythose to the government.So you can use gold as a money.It can be a stored value.It can be a means of exchange.But you can't pay your\ntaxes in gold, right?You have to--PROFESSOR: Is that correct?So 19th century, could you pay\nyour taxes in gold in the USand in Britain and\nother countries thathad gold currency?This is just a yes\nor no, but James?AUDIENCE: It's yes, but after\n1970s, the paper currencyis attached to\nthe gold standard.So inherently, there\nis an exchange of valuethat is picked by the\ngovernment or the central bank.So it's almost one of the\nsame thing at that time,until more recent years.PROFESSOR: James is saying you\ncould use gold as legal tender.Legal tender,\nagain, is somethingthat a society comes\ntogether and creates a law--back to the Lessig four.Society together\nsays-- it's not justa social normative behavior.It's

inherently behind it.And then some forms of\ncurrency, like grain, had more.So maybe it's a continuum.Maybe it's not black\nand white, 100% or 0%.And then we're going\nto talk a little bitabout how Bitcoin fits into it.And our next three\nclasses are goingto be really into the\ntechnology of Bitcoin,but just a little bit\nof teasing out before Igo through some lecture slides.Who wants to talk\nabout how Bitcoin mightfit into this history of money?And then I'm going to return\nto that question in about45 minutes and ask you again.Does anybody want to\nsay from the readings?And you remind me your name?AUDIENCE: Isabel.PROFESSOR: Isabel.AUDIENCE: So with\nBitcoin, it's kindof the same, where\nthe value is givenby society, except\nwith Bitcoin, it'snot backed by a central bank.So people don't think that\nthere is an inherent value.But the readings\npointed out that there'ssort of that same history,\nexcept it doesn't have[INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: So Isabel\nis saying that Bitcoinfits into the history of money\nbecause, like fiat currenciesand like Jihei said about\ngold, it doesn't necessarilyhave any inherent\nmonetary value,but it's a societal set of norms\nthat people are accepting itas having value.But the key distinction\nthat Isabel saidwas that it's no central.AUDIENCE: It's not backed\nby any kind of central bank.PROFESSOR: It's not\nbacked by a central

inherent valuein terms of medium of exchange.And it will change as society\nadopts it more and more.So I think it's hard to define\nif there is inherent valueor not.PROFESSOR: So Alan is\nraising that Bitcoin--if I can put some\nwords in your mouth,and tell me if I'm\ncorrect, that Bitcoinmight have some\ndistinguishing featuresfrom even fiat currency,\nthat its value is shiftingover time with

recognized through Taccounts or other\nforms of ledgers,that it adds to this whole\nlong history of ledgers.I agree with that.And it's a new form\nof keeping ledgers.Alan?AUDIENCE: So Bitcoin is\nalso

You can only generate\n50 bitcoins every 10 minutes,and it keeps happening\nevery four years.PROFESSOR: So it seems\nlike scarcity and ledgersare important components.Aviva?AUDIENCE: Yes.So it does have a fixed demand--sorry, a fixed supply, like\nyou said, in terms of scarcity.But the more we\nadopt it, the moreit becomes divisible\nin terms of units.And so we can increase its use,\nbecause now you can divide themup to [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: This is good.So divisibility is another\ncharacteristic of money,scarcity, adoption as\nAlan said, ledgers.Sorry, Tomas?AUDIENCE: We mention\ndecentralization,because this implementation\nmake feasible the Bitcoinand makes feasible to\nimplement this kind of thingin the decentralized\nenvironment.So without any central\nauthority

Alexis.PROFESSOR: Alexis.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\nof like moneyand other forms\nof currency, evenif it's controlled by central\ngovernment or central bank,there's no fixed exchange rate.It trades extremely quickly\nwith other types of currency,so I mean, it's\nstill very different.PROFESSOR: So, Alexis, if\nI understand Alexis' point,it's that there's no fixed\nexchange rate about Bitcoinwe're talking about.But couldn't we really broaden\nthat to all forms of currency?I mean, what really\nis the exchangerate between an ounce of\ngold and a bushel of corn?AUDIENCE: Yes and no.I mean, yes,

that's a good thing.A ledger is basically a way\nto record economic activityor social relationships or\nfinancial relationships.I would say it's both a way\nto record economic activity,and it's a system of recording\nfinancial relationships.And while I didn't\nassign these readings,some very good academic\nresearch suggeststhat the first methods of\nwriting and symbols of writinghad to do with numbers and\nhad to do with ledgers, ratherthan words and communication.Because it's so\nfundamental to societyto record various\neconomic transactionsor to record the\nfinancial relationshipsamongst

little three-minute video?What'd you think?I mean, just as a--I'm sorry, here.We haven't chatted yet.AUDIENCE: I think the\nbroad-based message wasthat any currency, or\nanything, for that matter,has value equivalent to what\nthe society assigns it with.Because the video\nbasically just showeda guy who created his\nown currency and was justselling it to the public.And his whole claim\nwas that it is realif you believe it is real.PROFESSOR: So it was just a\nnice little ditty, in a way.Matthew, I'm sorry?AUDIENCE: I would have\ngiven him $1 for it.PROFESSOR: You would\nhave given him $1?Great.AUDIENCE: Seeing how\nmuch the pizzas went for.AUDIENCE: Who knows?PROFESSOR: Would anybody else\nhave given him $1 for it?No?Oh, you would have?AUDIENCE: Actually, I'm\nworking with local currencies.And it's kind of the same, but\nyou can use them just locally.I mean, it keeps the\nmoney inside the communitythat decides to use that\nway of transactions.PROFESSOR: We're going to refer\nback to each of these readingsas we go through\nthe next 45 minutes.Yeah?AUDIENCE: I was wondering\nif he was actuallybreaking the law by\nlaunching his own competingcurrency to the US dollar?Is that a legitimate--obviously, it didn't compete\nwith the US dollar, but--PROFESSOR: You raise\na very good question.I'm not aware of any\nstatute, federal or state,that says there's an absolute\nmonopoly on forms of currencyas there is in other\nthings, like youknow that slot in the\ndoor that's called the--where you can put a letter\nthrough the door or a mailbox?There's actually a

consumer protection.But I think it's allowed.So we'll refer to\nthese, Joaquin,and then I'm going to go on.AUDIENCE: Can you\nlegally pay, for example,salaries in bitcoin in the US?PROFESSOR: Yes.And

have some fun.So in Ethiopia, people\nput together salt bars.This is not that long ago.Salt, as Jihei said earlier,\nis really valuable in society,and they standardize\nthe shape and size.And so here's salt bars.We're going to get to,\na little bit later,all the characteristics\nof money.But what else do you think\na salt bar in Ethiopia,as opposed to maybe\nsome other country--what did it

preserver food?PROFESSOR: Well, you\ncan preserve food,but because it was mined, there\nwas some scarcity, as well.And a lot of currencies,\na lot of moneys over time,have that fundamental issue.Cowrie shells from West Africa.Does anyone know\nthe history of whencowrie shells got really\ndebased and stoppedbeing used, from the readings?I can't remember if that\nwas in the readings or not.They got debased when\nEuropeans startedto realize that they\nwere accepted as a value.And it's a very sad and\nterrible history, too,because it's related to\nthe whole slave trade.But that the Europeans\ncould figure outthat societies accepted\nthis as something of value,but they also\ndebased that currencyand they debased the land and\ncaptured people as slaves.It was quite a collection of\nnot particularly good thingsgoing on.Tally sticks in England.Does anybody, from\nthe readings--because there was a little\nbit of the debate in the firstreading about the\nhistory of money--want to chat?And I'll pull up the\nRai stones from Yap.How this fits into that first\nreading and the debate betweendid money come from\na history of barter,or did money come from a\nhistory of ledgers and

stone,we each have this piece.So on the island of\nYap, I can assure you,these stones could not be\nused for anything else.Does anyone know, because it\nwas outside the readings, whatmade these stones so scarce?So Rai stones were quarried on\nan island about 200 kilometersaway from Yap, so\nwere they exceedinglyhard to get, like gold,\nlike mining of gold.What else is mined these\ndays that might

off.Diner's Club started\nin the early 1950s.They found that they could get\na bunch of restaurants to say,wouldn't you want to extend\ncredit, and we'll back it?American Express\nin the mid-1950s.And then, finally,\nin the mid-1960s,Bank of America, which at that\ntime was a California bank,figured out they would\ncreate a co-operativewith a bunch of other US\nbanks to extend credit.And the credit boom took off.And what was interesting,\nthe laws to regulate all thisdidn't come until the\n1970s, at least in the US--the Fair Credit Reporting\nAct and all the other laws.There's three big\nones in the 1970s.I go to conferences sometime and\ntalk about Bitcoin regulation,and they say, well, why can't\nthe government solve this now?I sort of remind them that\nit took 15 to 20 years fromthe introduction of credit cards\nkind of in the early to mid1950s and the real\ntake-off in the 1960s--", "start": 3840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "it was 1974, 1970, '77,\nthe three big credit laws.So if

the\ncharacteristics of money.What makes a good money?We talked about some\nof this earlier.It's durable, meaning that that\nsalt cube wasn't the greatest,because if a lot of rain\ncame, that would wash away.Gold and silver,\nmetals, are durable.They're portable.The heavier it is,\nthe less portableit is, and that's why gold was\na better money than silver.You could move it--and better than\ncopper and bronze.It was divisible easily.You could slice things up.Uniform and fungible.And anyone who's who down the\nrabbit hole on this stuff,if you really want\nto learn about money,read about Crawford\nversus Royal Bank in 1749.There was a gentleman at the\nearly part of paper moneythat mailed two 20-pound notes,\nand he wrote his name on them.They got lost in the mail,\nand he took the banks to courtto say, those were mine,\nwhen they were found.And there was no law in Scotland\nor in England at the timeas to what to do about it.But if you lose or somebody\nstole a piece of art,you get it back.And the law was settled\nin 1749 that you actuallydon't get your money back.Does anybody want to guess\nas to why the courts--", "start": 3960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "it was a matter of\nfirst interpretation.The courts had no jurisprudence\non this before 1749.Why did the courts decide\nthat a piece of artwas different than currency?And it goes to the\nfundamental of whatmoney is, fiat money is.Anybody want to take a\nguess as to why the courts--they could have\ngone the other way.AUDIENCE: How could you tell\nif someone really owned money?How could you [INAUDIBLE]?PROFESSOR: He signed it.Actually, the facts were clear\nit was the currency he signed.I'm just helping\nyou out so that--that's a good point,\nbut he signed it.AUDIENCE: It can't be used\nas a medium of exchangeif it doesn't belong to\nthe person [INAUDIBLE]..PROFESSOR: In\nessence, if you wereto go back and read--\nthere's some history on this,and read the court cases.This was the point.The court basically\nsaid, we haveto make this a\nmedium of exchange,the greater social good.It has to be fungible.And the Royal Bank of Scotland\nwas, of course, kind ofcloser to the courts than\nthis gentleman, Crawford.But the banks were also saying,\nwe can't keep track of this.So it was a mixture of the\ntwo, but it made it fungible.Eric?AUDIENCE: Was it\nthose specific notesthat he had signed [INAUDIBLE]?PROFESSOR: Yeah.Yeah.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: And in 1749,\nthey all had serial numbers,and they were signed in\na way that not today.Of course, they're acceptable,\nand they're stable.And we're going to talk a\nlot about the last point.They're stable because\nthey're hard to mine,and Bitcoin has that\nembedded in it, as well.The design of money is\nreally important, as well.You can make it a token--a token is like\nsomething physical--or account based.We're of course now living in\na world of account-based money,and it's digital, not physical.It can be issued

Definitely not\nadoption by merchants.Very good.Third reason why they failed?One that's at the core\nof what Bitcoin solved.AUDIENCE: Incentivizing\nlike a decentralized networkto keep that

to tell\nyou, sometimesI get quite confused when\nI research a new app.Are they storing the value?Or are they just a\nprocessing provider to move--as we said earlier,\npayment systemsmove and change

the\nweekly batch of seals.And they actually published\nit in the New YorkTimes [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: So Caroline, it's\ngood to raise the question.I thought it was for\nThursday, but thank you.Stewart Haber, a\ncryptographer, and a colleagueat Bell Labs in the\nearly '90s, said,how do we notarize information,\ndigitally notarize?And we're going to be talking\nabout this Thursday a
