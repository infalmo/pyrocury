going to talk\nabout today is a technique--you guys done?OK, thanks.We're going to talk about\ntoday a technique knownas modal analysis,\nand it's a wayof analyzing things that\nvibrate, essentially thinkingabout them one mode and a time.Though you might not\nmake a lot of useof the actual calculations,\ndoing the math,throughout your careers, I\nthink if you understand itconceptually it'll help\nyou just have a betterunderstanding of what\nvibration is all about,just give you some insight\nto it that you otherwisewouldn't have.So the basic concept is\nthat you can model justabout any structural\nvibration as the summationof the individual\ncontributions of eachwhat we call natural mode.So what we mean\nby that is, let'sstart by thinking--\nactually, letme say that this applies\nto both continuous systemslike vibrating strings or\nbeams or buildings as itdoes to finite degree of\nfreedom rigid body systems.We haven't talked about\ncontinuous systems.I'll do a lecture on\nit as the last lectureof the term, just kind of an\nenrichment sort of lecture.But everything I say about\nfinite degree of freedomsystems can be extended\nto continuous systems.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "But since we've been studying\nrigid bodies and systemswith finite numbers\nof degrees of freedom,I'll explain-- I'll go\nthrough this analysisin the context of rigid body\nfinite degree of freedomsystems.So in general, we can write\nthe equations of motionfor finite degree of freedom\nsystems as a mass matrix.And to keep the kind\nof writing down,I'm just going to underline\nmatrices and a squiggleunder vectors so we have them.In general, we can write\nthe equations of motionas a mass matrix times\nan acceleration vectorplus a damping matrix\ntimes a velocity vector,stiffness matrix times\na displacement vector,all equal to some external\nvector of excitations.And I'm writing these as\nif these are translations,but you know, like from doing\nthe pendulum on the cartproblem, that the\nequations of motionmight involve rotations\nand displacements.And we let them-- they mix\ntogether here however theyfall out.But just to write\nthem symbolically,I'm just going to refer to\nall of those coordinateswith an x vector.OK, now the basic\npremise of modal analysisis a thing called the\nmodal expansion theorem.It's basically the\nassertion that youcan represent any\nmotion set of vectors--I'll write them kind of as a\nvector here for a moment-- x,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.239}, {"text": "as the superposition of\neach contributing mode.Now each mode has\na mode shape to it,which I'm going to call\nu, and up here I'llput a superscript\nfor what mode itis, the first mode, times\nits time-dependent behavior.And this is called, what\nthey call in textbooks,the natural coordinates.And we'll see what\nthose are in a second.So mode shape one.This is the time-dependent\nand amplitude partthat says how much the\ncontribution of mode oneis to this motion and what its\ntime dependence is, this is.And then you'd have mode\ntwo's contribution, q2.And this goes out to the nth\nmode's contribution, qn of t.And that's the\nproposition, that youcan represent the total\nresponse of the systemas a superposition of\nthe response of eachof the natural\nmodes of the system.And if it's an n degree\nof freedom system,there will be n\nnatural modes, so.Now something I didn't say here.This all assumes that\nthe system vibrates.So this is all in the\ndiscussion of thingsthat exhibit vibratory motion.So this is all, it should say\nhere, of vibrating systems, OK?", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.195}, {"text": "So this kind of a long\nand cumbersome wayof writing this out.So if you notice, each one of\nthese is the mode shape vector.And if I put them together in\na matrix just side by side,here's a u1 over to un and\nmultiply it by this vector,q1 of t down to qn.That's the same\nstatement but saidin a much more compact way.So this statement, this\nmodal expansion theorem,basically says the\nvector of-- theseare your generalized\ncoordinates, whichwe've been using all term long.These are the\ngeneralized coordinatesthat you choose to derive the\nequations of motion around.The vector of\ngeneralized coordinatescan be written as uq.And these are often called\nthe modal coordinatesor sometimes called the\nnatural

maybe\nthis is a good time to do this.You grab one end.So this is a-- and it's hard\nto see black against black.My apologies for that.So this is a guitar string\nor any stringed instrument.In fact, any long, slender thing\nunder tension will vibrate.And it has, if I\ndo this carefully,that's called the first\nmode of vibration.And that's when you pluck\nyour guitar string or violinin the middle.You mostly hear that.But at twice the frequency,\nif I can get it going here,there's a second\nmode of vibration.And for a taut\nstring, it happensto be at twice the\nfrequency of the first.And if my hand is\nwell calibrated--it may be easier if it's\na little longer-- if Iget this going right,\nthere's a third mode, OK?So that's what\nwe're calling-- oh,what I meant to say\nwhen I was doingthis is these shapes for\nthe vibrating string,that second mode shape happens\nto be one full sine wave.And the mode shape has the\nform sine n pi x over l,where l's the length\nof the string.n's the mode number.So first mode.Second mode is\nthis, when n is 2.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.577}, {"text": "First mode, n is 1.nth mode or something high,\nyou get higher modes like that.So these are the mode shapes\nfor a vibrating string.That's good for now.This two degree of freedom\nsystem with the two lumpmasses-- and it's\ngoing to show upthere, yeah-- this is\nbasically two lump masses.And we idealize the\nsprings as being massless,but it's a pretty\ngood approximation.This has two modes of vibration.And Professor Gossard made\nthese neat little things thatcan make it so-- and I'm\ngoing to come back to this,but there's mode one.And the mode shape\nis as this goes downone unit, that goes down\nabout two times as much.I'll give you the exact\nnumbers in a minute.And the other mode\nshape of the system--we're going to talk about this\ntoday and why this happens.But if I give it the\nright initial conditions,I can make it vibrate only\nin the second mode shape.And so it's now deflected\nwith the right conditionsso that it'll respond\nonly in second mode.This mass goes up\nand down a lot.That mass goes up in that\nlittle, opposite to it,actually.The frequency is\ndifferent from the first.But if this is moving one\nunit, then this down hereis moving minus 0.3 or\nsomething like that.And that ratio is constant.And that's called\nthe mode shape.So if you just pick one of them\nand say, let its motion be one,then all of the other\nmasses in the systemwill move in a particular\nratio to the motion of that onethat you arbitrarily set to one.So this is what we\nmean by mode shapes", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.857}, {"text": "and their natural frequencies.There's the natural\nfrequency associatedwith that first mode.And we can solve these\nthings

coordinates.And we now need to see how\nwe're going to use these.So in general, we have\nour equations of motion.And I'm going to\nsubstitute for x, x dot,and x double dot, these and\npre multiply by

a mass matrix\nis diagonal to start with.But even if it isn't,\nyou do this calculation,it will produce a\ndiagonal matrix.And that's because these\nmultiplications are always0 unless r is the same as s.And the same is true for u\ntranspose Ku will give youa K matrix that is diagonal.And you know,\nnormally the stiffnessmatrix we've come\nup with, they'vegenerally been full\nmatrices oftentimes.But

of motionfor all the possible\nmodes that this thing has?And it turns out\na lot, right, youhave to deal with the\nequation of motionof a single degree of freedom\nsystem to describe this.And that's the real point.You know they built\nthe Hancock buildingacross the river 35 years ago.It was losing\nwindows like crazy.It was a brand new building.And when the wind would\nget above 40 miles an hour,the windows started falling out.60 stories high, 60, 61 stories\nhigh, and the wind was blowing.Where do you suppose\nthe windows fall out?What part of the building?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Huh?I mean, you'd think that\nwhen the wind is blowingit get stronger as it goes up.It was probably blowing out\nthe windows at the top, right?But the windows were\nbreaking-- as time went by,every time a window would break,\nthey replaced this five footby nine foot sheet of glass\nwith a piece of plywood.And so you get this\nstatistical samplingafter a while of where\nthe breakage was.So you had no windows\nbroken at the top and a fewas you got further down and\nmore and lots of them broken outat the bottom.It turns out that that\nbuilding was vibrating mostlyin its first bending mode.It was going back\nand forth like this.Also happened to have\na torsional mode.Its first torsional mode\nwas kind of twisting aroundthe base like that.So in fact the\nmoment when the windwould get about\n40 miles an hour,this building would start\nrocking and rolling,mostly like this with a\nlittle of this thrown in, OK?But you can basically model\nthat complicated building thathas millions of possible\nnatural modes in it by one", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.253}, {"text": "or possibly two single degree\nof freedom oscillators.So that's the power\nof modal analysis.But I

Ihave to model with a big\nfinite element model.I see something that's\nvibrating at one frequency.And I know it has\na little decay.It'll have damping.It'll have a natural frequency.And I get

timeand talk about response\nto harmonic excitations.And we're going to use\nthat as the example.Before I go there, once we\nhave broken the system downand analyzed this way,\nhow do we get backto the motion of the system in\nour generalized coordinates,which are the ones\nwe're comfortable with?Because I don't know where\nto take a ruler and gomeasure this natural coordinate.So somehow I have to\nget back to puttingin the real physical\nmeasurementsthat I can relate to.Well, that's easy because\nwhere did we start with this?We started by saying this\nwhole thing began right here.",

to\napproximate the motionof this complicated\nsystem, by just a coupleof motile contributions\nbecause youknow they're the\nimportant ones, thisis a pretty short summation.This is how you get back to\nyour original modal coordinates.Just take the modal amplitude,\nmultiply it by the mode shape.And when you do that, it\nsays, if this turns outto be, say, sum a sine omega t,\nwhen you multiply by the modeshape it basically\ntells you how mucheach generalized coordinate\ngets of the motion.The mode shape\ndistributes thing answerout proportionally in\nthe correct amount.So this is how you get\nback to the original.So let's think about\nthat system and we'lldo an initial conditions\nkind of problem.So I think Professor\nGossard-- I thinkin class you sort of figured\nout what the

going to model that as\na dashpot between each massand the fixed reference frame\nbecause the bar doesn't move.So it's an approximate\nmodel of the damping.And so if we do our sum of\nforces on each
