[{"text": "[MUSIC PLAYING]GILBERT STRANG: So,\nI'm Gilbert Strang.And this is about my new course\n18.065 and the new textbookLinear Algebra and\nLearning from Data,and what's in those subjects.So there are really\ntwo essential topicsand two supplementary, but\nall very important subjects.So if I tell you about those\nfour parts of mathematics thatare in the course,\nthat will give youan idea if you're interested\nto follow through.So the first big subject\nis linear algebra.That subject has just surged,\nexploded in importancein practice.What I want to focus on is\nsome of the best matrices, say,symmetric matrices, orthogonal\nmatrices, and their relation.Those are the stars\nof linear algebra.And the key step is\nto factor a matrixinto maybe symmetric\ntimes orthogonal matrix,maybe orthogonal times diagonal\ntimes orthogonal matrix--that's a very important\nfactorization calledthe singular value\ndecomposition.That doesn't get into a lot\nof linear algebra courses,but it's so critical.So can I speak now about\nthe second important topic,which is deep learning?So what is deep learning?The job is to create a function.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.52}, {"text": "Your inputs are, like\nfor driverless cars,the input would be an\nimage that's a telephonepole or a pedestrian.And the system has to learn\nto recognize which it is.Or the inputs from\nhandwriting on addresseswould be a zip code.So the system has to learn how\nto recognize 0, 1, 2, 3 up to 9from handwriting of all kinds.Or another one is speech,\nlike what Siri has to do.So my speech has to get\ninput and interpretedand output by the\nprocess of deep learning.So it involves creating\na learning function.The function takes\nthe input, the data,and produces the output,\nthe meaning of that data.And so what's the function like?That's what mathematics\nis about, functions.So it involves matrix\nmultiplication.Part of the function\nis multiplying vectorsby matrices.So that's a bunch of steps.But if there was only that,\nif it was all linear algebra,the thing would\nfail and has failed.What makes it work now so much\nthat companies are investingenormously in the technology\nis that there is nowa nonlinear function, a very\nsimple one in the middlebetween every pair of matrices.And that nonlinear function, I\ncan even tell you what it is.It's a function f,\nlet's call it f,f of x is equal to\nx if x is positive.And f of x is 0\nif x is negative.So you can imagine it's graph.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.351}, {"text": "It's a flat line\nwhere it's negative.And then it's a 45 degree\nslope where it's positive.So putting that\nnonlinear functionin between the matrix\nmultiplicationsis the way to construct\nsuccessful learning function.But you have to\nfind those matrices.I mentioned two\nsupporting subjects.The first is-- optimization\nwould be the word.We have to find the entries\nin those matrices thatgo into the learning function.That's a crucial step.So this is a problem\nof minimizing the errorwith all those matrix\nentries as variables.So this is multivariable\ncalculus, like 100,000.500,000 variables, it's just\nunthinkable in a basic calculuscourse, but it's happening\nin a company that'sworking with deep learning.And so that's the giant\ncalculation of deep learning.That's what keeps\nGPU's going for a week.But it gives amazing\nresults that could neverhave been achieved in the past.So then the other key\nsubject is statistics.And the basic\nideas of statisticsplay a role here,\nbecause when you'remultiplying a whole sequence\nof matrices in deep learning,it's very possible\nfor the numbersto grow out of\nsight exponentiallyor to drop to zero.And both of those are bad news\nfor the learning function.So you need to keep the mean\nand variance at the right spotto keep those numbers in\nthe learning function,", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.491}, {"text": "those matrices in a good range.So this course won't\nbe a statistics course,but it will use statistics\nas deep learning does.So those are the four subjects.Linear algebra and deep\nlearning, two big ones.Optimization and\nstatistics, essential also.So I hope you'll enjoy the\nvideos and enjoy the textbook.And go to the OpenCourseWare\nsite ocw.mit.edufor the full picture.Beyond the videos, there\nare exercises, problems,discussion, lots more toward\nmaking a complete presentation,which I hope you like.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.623}]
