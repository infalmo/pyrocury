examplesof what you can put in your\narmamentarium of speakingtechniques, and it\nwill be the casethat some one of those examples,\nsome heuristic, some technique,maybe only one, will make--will be the one that\ngets you the job.And so this is a very\nnon-linear process.You never know when\nit's going to happen,but that is my promise.By the end of the\nnext 60 minutes,you'll have been exposed to\na lot of ideas, some of whichyou'll incorporate into\nyour own repertoire,and they will ensure that you\nget the maximum opportunityto have your ideas\nvalued and acceptedby the people you speak with.Now, in order to\ndo that, we haveto have a rule of\nengagement, and thatis no laptops, no cell phones.So if you could\nclose those, I'llstart up as soon as you're done.Some people ask why that\nis a rule of engagement,and the answer\nis, we humans onlyhave one language processor.And if your language\nprocessor is enga--could you shut the\nlaptop, please?If your language processor\nis engaged browsing the webor reading your email,\nyou're distracted.And worse yet, you distract\nall of the people around you.Studies have shown that.And worse yet, if I see a\nopen laptop somewhere

performancethat they came to have.So that's it for preamble.Let's get started.First thing we talk about,\nof course, is how to start.Some people think\nthe right thing to dois to start a talk with a joke.I don't recommend\nit, and the reasonis that, in the\nbeginning of a talk,people are still putting\ntheir laptops away.They're becoming adjusted\nto your speaking parameters,to your vocal parameters, and\nthey're not ready for a joke.So it doesn't work very well.They usually fall flat.What you want to do instead is\nstart with empowerment promise.You want to tell\npeople what they'regoing to know at\nthe end of the hourthat they didn't know at\nthe beginning of the hour.It's an empowerment promise.It's the reason for being here.What would be an example?Oh, I see.At the end

that's the best way to start.So now that I've talked a\nlittle bit about how to start,what I want to do is give you\nsome samples of heuristicsthat are always on my\nmind when I give a talk,and first of these heuristics is\nthat it's a good idea to cycleon the subject.Go around it.Go round it again.Go round it again.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.305}, {"text": "Some people say, tell him\nwhat you

given\nmoment, about 20% of youwill be fogged out no\nmatter what the lecture is.So if you want to ensure that\nthe probability that everybodygets it is high, you need\nto say it three times.So cycling is one of\nthe things that I alwaysthink about when I give a talk.Another thing I think about\nis, in explaining my idea,I want to build a fence around\nit so that it's not confusedwith somebody else's idea.So if you were from Mars,\nand I was teaching youabout what an arch is,\nI might say to you,well, that's an arch.And that's not to be confused\nwith some other thingsthat other people\nmight think is--this is not an arch.That's not an arch.I'm building a\nfence around my ideaso that it can be distinguished\nfrom somebody else's idea.So in a more technical\nsense, I might say, well,my algorithm might similar--might seem similar\nto Jones's algorithm,except his is exponential,\nand mine's linear.That's putting a\nfence around your ideaso that people can not\nbe confused about how itmight relate to something else.The third thing on\nthis list of samplesis the idea of\nverbal punctuation.And the idea here is\nthat, because peoplewill occasionally fog out and\nneed to

first\nidea-- that's cycling.The second idea,\nbuilding-- and now,the third idea is\nverbal punctuation.So I'm enumerating\nand providing numbers.I'm giving you a sense that\nthere's a seam in the

course, the question\nhas to be carefully chosen.It can't be too obvious\nbecause then peoplewill be embarrassed to say\nit, but the answers can'tbe too hard because then nobody\nwill have anything to say.So here are some\nsample heuristicsyou can put in\nyour armamentariumand build up your repertoire\nof ideas about presentation.And now, if this\npersuades you that thereis something to know,\nthat there is knowledge,then I've already succeeded\nbecause what I want to convinceyou of, is if you watch the\nspeakers you admire and feelare effective,\nand ask yourselves", "start": 480.0, "heat":

you think is a\ngood time to have a lecture?11 AM?Yeah.And the reason is most people\nat MIT are awake by then,and hardly anyone has\ngone back to sleep.It's not right after a meal.People aren't fatigued\nfrom this or that.It's a great time\nto have a lecture.So that brings me, next,\nto the question of whatabout the place?And the most important\nthing about the placeis that it be well lit.This room is well lit.Problem with other kinds\nof rooms is that we humans,whenever the lights\ngo down, or wheneverthe room is dimly\nlighted, it signalsthat we should go to sleep.So whenever I go\nsomewhere to give a talk,even today, the\nfirst thing I do whenI speak to the\naudio-visual peopleis say, keep the lights full up.Oh, they might reply, people\nwill see the slides betterif we turn the lights\noff, and then I reply,it's extremely hard to see\nslides through closed eyelids.What else can you\nsay about the place?Well, the place\nshould be cased, and Imean that in a

you do your robbery.So whenever I go\nsomewhere to speak,the first thing I ask my host\nto do is to take me to the placewhere I'll be speaking so that\nif there are any weirdnesses,I'll be able to deal with it.Sometimes, it might\nrequire some intervention.Sometimes, it just might\nrequire me to understandwhat the challenges are.So when I came\nhere this morning,I did what I typically do.I imagined that\nall the seats werefilled with disinterested\nfarm animals,and that way, I knew that,\nno matter how bad it was,it wouldn't be as bad as that.So finally, it should\nbe reasonably--it should be\nreasonably populated.It should be the case that--if there were 10\npeople in this hall,everyone would be\nwondering, what'sgoing on that's so much more\ninteresting that nobody's here.So you want to get a\nright sized place that's--doesn't have to\nbe packed, but ithas to be more than half full.So those are some thoughts\nabout a time and place.Next thing I want to\ntalk about is a subjectof boards and props and slides.Well, these are the\ntools of the trade.I believe that this is the\nright tool for speakingwhen your purpose is informing.The slides are good when\nyour purpose is exposing,but this is what I use when I'm\ninforming, teaching, lecturing,", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.354}, {"text": "and there's several\nreasons why I use it.For one thing, when\nyou use the board,you have a graphic quality.It's the case that, when\nyou have a board, thenyou can easily exploit the\nfact that you can use graphicsin your presentation.So that's the graphic quality\nthat I like, and the next thingI like is the speed property.The speed with which you\nwrite on the blackboardis approximately the speed at\nwhich people can absorb ideas.If you go flipping\nthrough a bunch of slides,nobody can go that fast.Finally, one great\nproperty of a boardis that it can be a target.Many people who are\nnovices at speakingfind themselves suddenly\naware of their hands.It's as if their hands were\nprivate parts that shouldn'tbe exposed in public, so right\naway, they go into the pockets,and this is considered insulting\nin some parts of the world.Or alternatively,\nmaybe the handswill go in back like this.I was once in a convent\nin Serbia, and my host--as soon as we entered,\na nun came up to usand offered us a refreshment.And I was about to\nsay, no, thank you,and he said, eat\nthat stuff or die.It's a question of local\ncustom and politeness.But then before\nanything happened there,the nun pulled my\nhands out like thisbecause it was extraordinarily\ninsulting in that cultureto have your hands\nbehind your back.So why is that?Well, it's usually\nsupposed that that'sthat it has to do with whether\nyou're concealing a weapon.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.234}, {"text": "So if your hands are in your\npockets or behind your back,then it looks like you\nmight have a weapon,and that's what I\nmean by the virtue--one of these virtues\nof the board.Now, you have something\nto do with your hands.You can point out the stuff.I was once watching Seymour\nPapert give a lecture,and I thought it was terrific.So I went a second time--first time to absorb\nthe content, second timeto note style.And what I discovered is\nthat Papert was constantlypointing at the board.And then I thought\nabout it a little while,and I noted that none of\nthe stuff he was pointing tohad anything to do with\nwhat he was saying.Nevertheless, it was\nan effective technique.So that's just a little\nbit about the virtueof blackboards.Now, I want to talk about props.The custodians of\nknowledge about propsare the playwrights.Many decades ago, I saw\na play by Henrik Ibsen.It was Hedda Gabler.I remember vaguely that it was\nabout a woman in an unhappymarriage, and her husband was in\ncompetition for an academic jobwith somebody else.And he was going to lose\npartly because he was boring,and partly because the\ncompetitor had justwritten a magnificent book.By the way, this\nis back in the daysbefore there were copying\nmachines and computers.Anyhow, as the play opens,\nthere's a potbellied stove,and in the beginning\nof the play,the potbelly stove,\nwith its open door,just has some slightly\nglowing embers.But the potbellied\nstove is always there,and as tension\nmounts in the play,and you see this\nmanuscript, this", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.29}, {"text": "prop that Ibsen so artfully\nused, you just knowthat something's\ngoing to happen,because as the play goes on,\nthe fire gets bigger and hotterand finally all\nconsuming, and you justknow that that manuscript is\ngoing to go into that fire.This memorable thing is what\nI remember about the play.So playwrights have got\nthis all figured out,but on the other hand,\nthey're not the only peoplewho can use props.Here's an example of\nthe use of a prop, alsodue to Seymour Papert.He was talking about how\nit's important to lookat the problem in the\nright way, and here'san example that not only teaches\nthat, but makes it possiblefor you to embarrass\nyour friendsin mechanical engineering.So here's what you do.Take a bicycle wheel, and\nyou start it spinning.And then you put some\ntorque on the axle,or equivalently, you\nblow on the edge.And the issue is,\ndoes it go that way,or does it go that way?Now, the mechanical engineers\nwill immediately say, oh, yes,I see-- right hand screw wheel.And they'll put their\nfingers in this position,but forget exactly how\nto align their fingerswith the various\naspects of the problem.And so it's usually the\ncase that they get it rightwith about a 50% probability.So their very fancy\neducation gets them upto the point where they're\nequivalent to flipping a coin.But it doesn't\nhave to be that waybecause you can think about the\nproblem a little differently.So here's what you do.You take some duct\ntape, and you put itaround the part of\nthe wheel like that.And now, you start to think\nabout, not the whole wheel,",

air.Forgetting about the\nrest of the wheel,what happens to that\nlittle piece that'sunder the duct tape?It must want to go\nthat way because youbanged on it like that.It's already going\ndown like that.And what about the next piece?Same thing.Next piece?Same thing.So the only thing\nthat can happenis that the wheel\ngoes over like that.And so now, you'll\nnever wonder againbecause you're thinking about\nthe problem in the right way,and it's demonstrated\nby the use of a prop.You can try this\nafter we're done.Another example I\nlike to rememberis one from when\nI was taking 8.01.Alan Lazarus was the\ninstructor at the time,and he was talking about the\nconservation of energy, kineticand potential.And there was a long wire in\na ceiling in 26-100 attachedto a much bigger\nsteel ball, but one--not one like this.And Lazarus took the ball up\nagainst the wall like this.He put his head flat against\nthe wall to steady himself,and then he let go,\nand the pendulumtakes many seconds\nto go over and back,and then gently\nkisses Lazarus's nose.And so you have many\nseconds to think,this guy really believes in\nthe conservation of energy.Do not try this at home.The problem is that, the\nfirst time you do this,you may not just let go.There's a natural\nhuman tendency to push.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.237}, {"text": "So that's a little bit\non a subject of props.It's interesting.Whenever surveys are taken,\nstudents always say more chalk,less PowerPoint.And why would that be?Props are also very effective.Why would that be?I'll give you my lunatic\nfringe view on this.It has to do with what I would\ncall empathetic mirroring.When you're sitting up there\nwatching me write on the board,all those little mirror neurons\nin your head, I believe,become actuated,

separated out.But I think the\nempathetic mirroringis why props and the use of a\nblackboard are so effective.Well, let's see-- oh, yes,\nthere is one more thingby way of the\ntools, and that hasto do

transparencies.People in your audience\nknow how to read,and reading will\njust annoy them.Also, you should\nbe sure that youhave only a few words\non each transparency,and that the words\nare easy to

condiments to whatyou're saying, not the main\nevent or the opposite wayaround.So how can we fix this?Step number one is to get\nrid of the background junk.That's always distraction.Step number two is to\nget rid of the words.When I reduced the\nwords to these,then everything I\nread a previous time,I'm not licensed to say,\nbecause it's not on the slide.I'm not reading\nmy slides anymore,but I'm

think.And then you say\noh, that's great.How do you teach\npeople how to think?Blank stare.No one can quite\nrespond to that part,that natural next question.So how do you teach\npeople how to think?Well, I believe that we\nare storytelling animals.And that we start\ndeveloping our story,understanding and\nmanipulating skillswith fairy tales in\nchildhood and continue onthrough professional schools\nlike law, business, medicine,everything.And we continue doing\nthat throughout life.So if that is what\nthinking is all about.And we want to teach\npeople how to think,you provide them with the\nstories they need to know,the questions they need to\nask about those stories,mechanisms for\nanalyzing those stories,ways of putting\nstories together,ways of evaluating how\nreliable a story is.And that's what I think you\nneed to do when you teach peoplehow to think.But that's all about education.And many of you here\nare not necessarilyfor that, but rather\nfor this part,for persuading,

a problem that's being\npursued all over the world.There hasn't been any progress\nbefore me in the past 30 years.Everyone is looking\nfor a solutionbecause it will\nhave impact on somany other things, such\nsituating and time and placeand feel.And then as far as\npractice is concerned, yes,practice is important.But that doesn't mean showing\nyour slides to the peopleyou share an with.The problem with that is that if\npeople know what you're doing,they will hallucinate\nthat there'smaterial in your\npresentation that isn't thereif it isn't there.A variation on the\nscene, by the way,is your faculty supervisor\nis not a very good personto help you debug a talk\nbecause they, in fact, knowwhat you're doing.And they will, in\nfact, hallucinatethere's material in your\npresentation that
