[{"text": "DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and\nwelcome back to recitation.Today the problem I'd\nlike to work with youis about computing\npartial derivativesand the total differential.So we have a function z which\nis x squared plus y squared.So it depends on the\ntwo variables x and y.Now the variables\nx and y themselvesdepend on two auxiliary\nvariables, u and v.So that's the\nsetup that we have.So in part a, we just want to\ncompute the total differentialdz in terms of dx and dy.So u and v aren't going\nto enter into the picture.And then in part b,\nwe're going to computethe partial derivative\npartial z partial uin two different ways.First, we're going to compute\nit using the chain rule.And then we're going to compute\nit using total differentials.And so we'll substitute\nin some of the workthat we had in a\nto solve that part.So why don't you pause the video\nnow and work on the problem.We'll check back and\nwe'll do it together.Hi, and welcome back.Let's get started.So first, computing\na is not so bad.So we just need\nto first remember,what does it mean to compute\nthe total differential?So the total\ndifferential dz is justthe partial derivative of z\nin the x-direction dx plusz in the y-direction dy.OK?So now, looking at our\nformula here for z,we have-- so the\npartial derivative of zin the x-direction is\n2x, so this is 2x dx.And the partial derivative\nof z in the y is 2y,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "so we have 2y dy.OK, and that's all\nwe have to do for a.Now for b, we want to compute\nthis partial derivativein two different ways.First, using the chain rule.So let's remember what\nthe chain rule says.So whenever I think\nabout the chain rule,I like to draw this\ndependency graph.OK?And this is just a\nway for me to organizehow the different variables\ndepend on one another.So at the top, we have z.And z is a function of\nx and y, but x is itselfa function of both u\nand v, and y is alsoa function of u and v.\nSo z depends on x and y,and x and y each jointly\ndepend on u and v.So it's a little\nbit complicated,the relationships here.So now, what the\nchain rule says isthat if we take a partial\nderivative-- partial zpartial u-- we have to go\nthrough our dependency graph.Every way that we\ncan get from z to u,we get a term in our summation\nfor each one of those.So for instance, z\ngoes to x goes to u.So that means that we\nhave partial z partial x,partial x partial u.And then we can also go\nz goes to y goes to u.And that will give us partial z\npartial y, partial y partial u.And now these partials\nare ones that we can justcompute from our formulas.So for instance,\npartial z partial xis 2x, which we computed.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Now partial x partial u, we have\nto remember that x is definedas u squared minus v squared.And so partial x\npartial u, that's 2u.Partial z partial y, again,\nis this 2y that we computed.And partial y partial u is v.\nThis v is just because u wasu*v, and we take a partial\nin the u-direction.OK.So altogether this\nis 4u*x plus 2v*y,and that's our\npartial derivative.So notice that, you know,\nx is a function of u and v.So if I really wanted\nto, I could substitutefor x its formula for\nu and v, but that's notreally necessary.You know, what's interesting\nabout these problems ishow the differentials\ndepend on one another,and I'm perfectly happy\nwith an answer thathas mixed variables like this.That's fine.So now, let's go\nover here and let'ssee if we can get the\nsame answer by usingtotal differentials.Now, I have to say\nthat the chain rulethat we used on the\nprevious problem,it's the quickest way to\ndo these sorts of things.I like to do total differentials\nif I have some timeto actually explore the problem\nand get comfortable with it.I prefer to use total\ndifferentials because I thinkit's a little bit clearer.Somehow, this chain\nrule it's just, to me,it's just a prescription,\nit's not an explanation.So why don't we compute\nsome total differentials.So we already saw-- let\nme just repeat over here.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "We already saw that dz\nis 2x dx plus 2y dy.OK.Now, we want to\nuse the fact that xis itself a function of\nu and v. So that's whatwe need to do now.So that tells us that dx is 2u\ndu minus 2v dv in the same way.And dy.So remember, y was u*v.\nSo taking d of u*v,we get v du plus u dv.OK?So now, so what we've\ndone is we've justlisted out all of the\ntotal differentials.And the nice thing about\nthis is once you'vedone these computations,\nnow it's just substitution.So what we really want\nto know is how does zdepend on u and v. And\nso all we need to dois substitute in our\nformulas for dx here.So this tells us\nthat dz is-- OK,so we have 2x-- instead of\ndx, we just plug in here--so we have 2u du minus 2v dv.So that was this term.And now we have\nplus 2y-- and nowwe just plug in this--\nso v du plus u dv.You see?It's just substitution.So then now, we just\nexpand everything out.And so we get-- OK,\nso let's collectall the things involving du.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So if we collect all the\nthings involving du, we have--2 times 2 times x times\nu-- 4x*u plus 2y*v.This whole quantity times du.And then if we collect the\nterms in dv, we have 2y*u.So that's coming from here, and\nthen we have a minus 4x*v. OK?And now what that tells\nus is that-- so let'sjust remember that\none definitionof the partial derivative\npartial z partial uis this coefficient.So if I go over here, if we\nwrite the total differentialdz, we can write that as\npartial z partial u duplus partial z partial v dv.Right?Well, look.What we have here\non these two sidesis essentially the\nsame expression.So that means if\nwe want to computepartial z partial u, then that's\njust equal to this coefficienthere.So we get that partial z\npartial u is 4x*u plus 2--that should be v.\nOne of those is an x.Let's see.So where did this come from.Yeah, one of those\nis an x, sorry--SPEAKER 1: It's a y.DAVID JORDAN: --is a y.2v*y, OK.Now just as a sanity\ncheck, why don't wego back to the\nmiddle of the board,", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and we'll see that we\ngot the same thing.So 4x*u plus 2v*y, that's what\nwe concluded for partial zpartial u.And then going back to the\nmiddle of the board, that's wefound again.So let's just go over\nthe two different methodsand compare them.So if I'm in a rush to\ndo a computation-- maybeI'm taking an\nexam-- I definitelythink it's the quickest\nto just compute,to figure out what the\ndependency of the variable is,and I use this dependency graph.And then I just trace\nall the paths from zto the independent variable\nu that I'm interested in.And then I multiply all\nthe partial derivativesthat correspond to each edge\nand I get an expression.Now if I have more\ntime, then I reallyprefer to use the method\nof total differentialsthat we did on the third board.I like it, because once you\ndo some simple calculus,and then after that it's\njust, it's basic algebra.I find that I'm\nless likely to makea mistake doing that method.But as you saw, it\ninvolves computinga lot more derivatives\nthat we didn't actuallyuse in the final answer.For instance, when we\ncomputed total differentials,we got an expression\nfor partial z partial vat the end of the\nday, even though weweren't asked to do that.So it's lengthier, but I\nthink more conceptuallystraightforward.So I think I'll\nleave it at that.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}]
