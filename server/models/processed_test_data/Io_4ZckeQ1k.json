Table.I know some of you are going\nto say, well that's so 19thcentury, rote learning\nand so on.To which I say, you're wrong.Every educated person should\nknow that potassium lies undersodium, which lies\nunder lithium.And you are going to\nbe educated whetheryou like it or not.But this is a lot to learn and\nso we're just going to look atthe main block.We're not going to ask you to\nmemorize the lanthanides,actinides and the\nsuper heavies.We'll leave that out.So it's quite straightforward.We've been doing this\nfor many years.This is from 2004.And it's not that hard.I give you the blank here.And I even put the numbers\non for you.And all you have to do\nis add the two-letteror one-letter symbol.You don't have to give me the\nfull name of the element.You don't have to get\nme its

never\ngot to was how do we tell thatmagnesium has a higher affinity\nfor chlorine thantitanium does?How do we know that magnesium\nis going to reduce titaniumtetrachloride to a sponge?So for that we have to\nlook inside the atom.We have to look inside\nthe atom.So that's what we're going\nto start doing today.And we're going to begin,\nas often we will,with a history lesson.So let's go back for a status\nreport around the end of the19th century.So what did we know towards the\nend of the 19th century?The atom is electrically\nneutral.The negative charge is\ncarried by electrons.We knew that there was some\ncarrier of negative charge.We knew further that this\nelectron is very, very tiny.Small mass.And so if it has a very small\nmass, then by difference, thenthe bulk of the mass of atom\nmust be contained in thepositive charge.So now the question is, what is\nthe spatial distribution ofcharge inside an atom?You might say, well why do\nwe want to know that?Well, we're trying to get a\nphysical model of the atom sothat then we can start to\naddress the question ofchemical reactivity.So we have got to know where all\nthe players are before wecan attribute action to them.So let's now take a look\nat models of the atom.For the first modern model\nof the atom we go to J.J.Thompson.J.J.Thompson, he was a professor of\nphysics and director of theCavendish lab at

operation\nto this day.So what did J.J.Thompson tell us?He said the electrons were\ndistributed throughout auniformly charged positive\nsphere of atomic dimensions.So that's the text.Now let's make this cartoon,\nbecause that makes more sense.Visualize it a little\nbit better.So it looks a little\nbit like this.So here's a sphere of\natomic dimension.Electrons are these tiny little\nthings distributedthroughout the positive\nsphere.And this is massive because\nthe electrons havevery, very low mass.And just to be clear, there\nare no protons.No protons.So this isn't positive.It's a positive chargeness.It's just a big positive blur.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And then the little\nelectrons inside.So the electrons are negative,\nand they're tiny and low-mass,and they're mobile.He didn't say much about how\nthey move, but you can imaginethat they move, and maybe\nthey even spin.And so on.And this was known as the\nPlum Pudding Model.There's a big cultural\nbias here.So even though I grew up in\nBritish Canada, I never hadthis stuff.But my understanding is plum\npudding is this dish that'sserved at holidays and\nChristmas-time.So the custard is the charge,\nthe positive charge.And these little bits of fruit\nare the electrons.And they're throughout.At Christmas-time, they\nmight even putlittle charms in here.Like a little wishbone or\nsomething for good luck.And you pull it out and all\nthat kind of stuff.Yeah that's merry,\nold England.So this is the Plum\nPudding Model.And that's what was in place.By the way, we've been using\nthe term electron, but J.J.did not like the\nterm electron.Actually, he won his Nobel\nPrize for the-- quote,unquote-- the discovery\nof the electron.Just as Cavendish didn't\ndiscover hydrogen, hecharacterized it.J.J.Thompson characterized\nthe electron.What did he in particular\ncharacterize?He characterized the\ncharge-to-mass ratio.He made the first quantitative\nmeasure of the charge-to-massratio of the electron.But he never used the\nterm, electron.He called it the corpuscle.He called it the corpuscle of\nelectrical charge, whereasthis is really sort of\nan elementary

And the\nperson who puts the theory tothe test is a man by the name\nof Ernest Rutherford.Rutherford was an interesting\ncharacter.He came from New Zealand and\nhe was born on a farm.It was a family with\n12 children.You notice Mendeleyev came from\na family of 14, this guycomes from a family of 12.So you learn how to survive.He worked on a farm so he was\nvery handy, and that came into play as his career\nprogressed.He was a brilliant\nexperimentalist. He was ableto do experiments where\nothers failed.And he did this experiment where\nhe was a professor ofphysics at Victoria University\nin Manchester in the UK.Now, he came out of New Zealand,\ngot a scholarship tostudy at Cambridge University.And he was actually a research\nstudent for J.J.Thompson.And he conducted his thesis\nresearch under J.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.831}, {"text": "J.and during that time his thesis\nresearch was about theproperties of charged\nparticles.And they were very interested\nin gases and radioactiveelements, ionizing radiation,\nthe whole thing.The Cavendish lab was a\nbeehive of activity.And what he did under his PhD\nwas he understood both thealpha particle and the\nbeta particle.First, he identified\nwhat they are.The alpha particle\nwas determined tobe the helium nucleus.So this is helium that's lost\nboth of its electrons.So it's just protons and\nneutrons in the nucleus.Completely naked.No electrons.And then the beta particle,\nwhich other people in physicshad been referring to this\nmysterious beta particle, hemade the connection\nbetween the betaparticle and the electron.So the same electron that's over\nhere and attributed tothe negative charge within the\nnucleus is also a freeparticle that can go\nthrough space.And these are taken\nfrom your reading.And you can see that if you send\nthe particle beam througha charged plate, the negative\nplate here being the lowerplate, the positive particle,\nwhich in this case is thealpha particle, will bend down\ntowards the negative plate.And the negative particle, being\nthe free electron, isbent in the opposite\ndirection.So these are the kinds of\nexperiments they would do.And they also looked\nat their ability topenetrate different media.So when it comes to their\nability to penetrate solids,they differentiate themselves.So they alpha particle\nis quite poorat penetrating solids.So you see in the cartoon there,\nthe alpha particle isstopped even by that little\nsheet of paper.So it doesn't do so well here,\nwhereas the beta particle, the", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.576}, {"text": "electron, can go zooming right\nthrough the paper and isstopped by the lead.And then over here they were\nalso studying their ability toionize gases.So if you take a gas and you\nbombard it with alphaparticles, will you get\na lot of ionization?Yes or no, et cetera.And what they found was that it\nwas a complementary, thatthe alpha particle is pretty\ngood at ionizing gases,whereas the beta particle is\npoor at ionizing gases, and infact, is stopped.This is why, if you\nhave an electronbeam you need a vacuum.Otherwise, the electron will\nbe dissipated in very, veryshort order.So after doing this\nwork with J.J., he got a teaching job\nin Canada at McGillUniversity up north.And while he was there he\ncontinued to do work on theorigin of alpha particles and\nwon the Nobel Prize for hiswork while he was at McGill.And so when he determined that\nthe alpha particle origin inthe decomposition, the\ndisintegration of elements.And believe it or not, in this\nwork back in 1906, 1907, hewas already anticipating nuclear\nfission because he wassaying that if you put thorium\nor polonium into a tube, youcan expect that it will\nemit alpha particles.Well, conservation of mass\nsays they have got to becoming from somewhere.And if they're not coming from\nout here, they have got to becoming from inside.This was brilliant work.This is Rutherford, young man\nin Montreal, gets the NobelPrize in 1908.And then he goes to Victoria\nUniversity, and he sets upthis experiment.Critical experiment.I mean, imagine this guy.I mean, he's already got\nthe Nobel Prize.He could just put his feet up.No, he keeps going.So this is the experiment.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "It's called the\nRutherford-Geiger-Marsdenexperiment.Because Rutherford was the\nbrains behind it and Geigerand Marsden were the\nguys in the lab.And so here's the experiment.So what he's going to do is he's\ngoing to put this modelto the test. We're going\nto see if this modelmakes sense or not.So he's got a gold foil-- now\nthey used different elements,but ultimately they loved gold\nbecause gold, first of all, isnoble and it doesn't oxide.So it's pure, even in\natmospheric oxygen.And secondly, we've known\nsince antiquity we canphysically deform gold and\nmake it into somethingsub-paper thin.So that's what they did.They beat this thing\ndown to 600nanometers thick, 0.6 micron.And they used alpha\nparticles here.Radium, polonium, thorium as\nthe source in the leadcontainer and so on.And this stream of alpha\nparticles comes zooming out atenergies of 7.68 million\nelectron volts per particle.So this is like a cannon with\na pumpkin in front of it.And they're going to shoot\nthese at the foil.So what's the purpose here?They want to see what's\ngoing on.And if you imagine that we are\nshooting alpha particles,which are positive, and I've\ngot a wall here of all ofthese nuclei that are\nessentially

thickness,\nI might start seeing someattenuation.But if I get the gold film\nreally thin, I should just goblasting these all through.Well, what they find\nis, two things.First of all, most of the\nparticles do go through.When they go through, they're\ndeflected a little bit.They don't just go through,\nthey are deflected.And most of them are deflected\nthrough low angles.But a small number of them are\ndeflected through high angles.They almost go straight\nback at the source.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.103}, {"text": "So if you've got that set of\ndata, that doesn't supportthis model.This model cannot be sustained\nin the light of those data.It's a very important\nexperiment.By the way, how do they\ncount these things?Well, Geiger is the\nsame guy who giveus the Geiger counter.Geiger was a technician that\nworked for Rutherford.And he developed this screen,\nthey called it ascintillation screen.It was coated with\nzinc sulfide.And so when alpha particles\nbounced and they hit thescreen, they would excite\nelectrons in the screen andthen cause a scintilla,\na spark.And then what you do is you just\nget a graduate student orsome other source of abundant,\ncheap labor-- and you have awhole bunch of graduate students\nsitting here-- andthey count.That's how it was done in\ngood old days, 1909.And so they counted what\nthe distribution was.So that's the experiment.So this is taken\nfrom your book.So this what you'd expect.And this is what they saw.So this is small angles and\nthis is large angles.Theaters of the angle here.Now Marsden, who's the third?There's a third person.Marsden.Marsden's not too different\nfrom you.Marsden was about 20 years\nold at the time.He dropped out of school and\nthen he came to Rutherford,and he said, I'm looking\nfor a job.In those days, you couldn't\nreturn to college.If you dropped out, finished.You had to stay all\nthe way through.Once you dropped out, they\nslam the door behind you.But Rutherford, he\nwas different.He looked at people\non the basis oftheir intrinsic value.He didn't care about title.And so he said to Marsden,\nOK, you want to dosomething for me?Here's your question, I like you\nto imagine an alternativemodel of the atom.And here's the alternative\nmodel of the atom.What Rutherford said was,\nsuppose instead, if this is", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.147}, {"text": "the dimension of the atom,\ninstead of having positivecharge uniformly distributed,\nhe said, what if we havepositive charge concentrated at\none point and then out herewe have the negative charge?So here's the positive charge.And here's a whole bunch\nof negative charge.And now here's the next one.And here's the next one.And so on.And now we're going to shoot\nthese helium nuclei.See what's in between here?This is a void, taking\nfrom Democritus.And so now if I shoot the\npositive helium nuclei here,if they get close\nto this positivecharge they'll be deflected.If they don't get close to the\npositive charge, they just goright through.And once in awhile they get\nalmost on axis, in which casethey fling back.This model would be consistent\nwith the data set I justshowed you.And then to go further, he says\nto Marsden, I'm going totell you what the distribution\nof high-angle scattering was,you tell me what is the ratio\nbetween the radius of thenucleus, where the positive\ncharge is to the-- excuse me,I'm showing you the diameter, so\nthis is the diameter of thenucleus versus the diameter\nof the atom.What would be the ratio\nof the two?I mean, it's gold, so I know\nI got 79 plus here.And I've got 2 plus.And I've got a 79 plus.What would be the size of the\nsphere of 79 plus that woulddeflect something of 2 plus\nthrough this angle?So that's Marsden.It's not bad for a kid that's\nbeen out of school for acouple of years.That's his problem.So he did.He did the calculation.He did the calculation and\nMarsden figured out that theradius of the nucleus to the\nradius of the

that's a big step forward\nfrom this thing here.So you'd think that the physicscommunity would be ecstatic.That now we've got a model that\nsquares with the data.Well, what do you think the\nreaction to Rutherford'sannouncement was?Condemnation.Derision.People didn't like it.They laughed at him.They said, well,\nthis is crazy.There's a couple of problems\nwith this.So strong negative reaction\nto Rutherford's model.And here the two major\nobjections that people posed.First of all, they talked\nabout nuclear collapse.They said if you've got a system\nof negative particlesrevolving around a positive\nnucleus, electrostatic forcesare going to cause them to\nbe drawn to one another.What's going to keep the\nelectrons from collapsing intothe nucleus?That was the first objection.Coulombic

work.Because you run out of energy.If you take a charged particle,\na charged particlethat accelerates consumes\nenergy.Acceleration, as you know, can\nmean either change in speed orchange in direction.So if the electron is revolving\nat a constant speed,it has to change direction;\notherwise, it willfly out of the room.So changing direction means\nacceleration, which means whatkeeps the energy in\nthe electron?Why doesn't the electron\njust run out ofenergy and just stop?Even if you can prevent\nit from collapsing,it will just stop.So this is the problem\nof energy deficit.Energy deficit.Well, what powers\nthe electron?What powers the accelerating\nelectron?So that's a problem.So now the story continues.The next chapter is 1912.Because this is 1911.In 1912, a young Danish\nbusinessman by the name ofNiels Bohr.Niels Bohr just finished his PhD\nin Copenhagen and he got afellowship from the Carlsburg\nBrewery Foundation.Carlsburg Brewery put up\nmoney for science.So he won a Carlsburg\nfellowship.And he was a young physicist.\nAnd he knew that in the UKthere was a controversy brewing\nbetween the model ofRutherford and the model of J.J.Thompson.So he says, you know what\nI'm going to do?I've got a year, I got money.I'm going to spend six\nmonths with J.J.Thompson, I'm going to spend\nsix months with ErnestRutherford.", "start": 1560.0, "heat":

developed a quantitative\nmodel.And that's all part of what I\nshowed you the other day.We recognize patterns.That's what the Rutherford,\nGeiger, Marsdenexperiment gave us.The pattern of the distribution\nof alpha particledeflections.So now we need to develop a\nquantitative model that willexplain the observations, and\nif it's a really good model,it will make predictions that,\nagain, can be tested byexperiment.So we ratchet back and forth\nbetween experiment, model.Experiment, model.So he proposes the model,\nnot with J.J., because J.J., I don't know what\nhe did there.This is

That was his way ofsaying, embroiled\nin controversy.If someone said something that\nhe didn't agree with, insteadof saying, I think that's\nnonsense, he say, veryinteresting.Very interesting.So great interest is to be\nattributed to this atom model.That means people are in pitched\nbattle on both sides.For as Rutherford has shown,\nthe assumption of theexistence of nuclei as those\nin question seems to benecessary in order to account\nfor the results of experimentson large-angle scattering\nof the alpha rays.Another footnote: Geiger\nand Marsden.Geiger and Marsden published\ntheir results in this journal.In an attempt to explain some of\nthe properties of matter onthe basis of this atom model,\nwe meet, however, withdifficulties of a serious\nnature arising from theapparent instability

curious.You condemn the Rutherford\nmodel because he's gotelectrons in motion, which means\nthey're accelerating inenergy deficit.But in the Plum Pudding Model,\nthe electrons arein motion, and

how\nscientists do it.They don't go, oh you're\nugly , and yourmother dresses you funny.Instead they write things like\nthis, difficulties purposelyavoided in atom models\npreviouslyconsidered for

theinadequacy of classical\nelectrodynamics in describingthe behavior of systems\nof atomic size.So he's saying that you can't\nuse classical electrodynamicsdown to subatomic dimensions.He's saying that those models,\nany more than you can useplanetary models down to human\ndimensions, this, in manyrespects, is foretelling\nnanotechnology.He's saying the properties we\nknow, of how things behave inthe Newtonian world are not\nnecessarily valid at atomicdimensions.This is very important stuff.Anyway, so what I did is I went\nthrough the paper andI've reduced the content of\nthe paper to these thingscalled postulates.So Rutherford's atom\nis correct.That's the first thing.Classical electromagnetic theory\nnot applicable to theorbiting electron.And you're going to get-- the\nPDF and all this

he'sgoing to derive something.Do we have to know\nderivations?This is the only time\nI'm going to derivesomething for you.The reason is, it teaches\nthe model.It teaches how the\nmodel is based onassumptions and so on.But I don't expect you to\nmemorize things because that'snot the way things work.So let's go starting with\nthis point here.This point here is\nBohr model atom.So it's Bohr's representation\nof the Rutherford model.We can call it a nuclear model\nor a planetary model.Because you've got orbiting\nelectrons.Now, first important point.The Bohr model is the\nsimplest model.It works for a one\nelectron system.So he has a single electron.Planetary model, single\nelectron.And this orbits the\npositive nucleus.So you might say, one electron,well, what's that mean?Well, obviously it means\natomic hydrogen.But it could mean helium plus.That's a one electron system.It could mean lithium 2 plus.It could mean roentgenium\n110 plus.That's a one electron system.And this is all gas.Gas phase.No solids here.Gas phase.So it's an isolated nucleus with\none electron around it.That's how we're\ngoing to begin.And here's what it looks like.I'm going to put the nucleus,\nfirst of all not to scale,because we're not going\nto draw 10,000 to 1.", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.154}, {"text": "Over here is the nucleus\nwith z positive charge.And then out here is the\nelectron in orbit.This is the lone electron\nin orbit.And this distance is r.The distance from the nucleus.You're going to say, well,\nis that from theoutside or the inside?It's 10,000 to 1; it\ndoesn't matter.Forget about it.So now let's use this concept.We're going to say it's a\nconservative system and so theenergy of the system is\nsimply going to be theenergy of the electron.You might say, well, why\ndon't you consider theenergy of the nucleus?Because the nucleus is,\nrelatively speaking,stationary.To use Rutherford's colorful\nlanguage, he says when anelephant has fleas, it's the\nfleas that do the jumping.So you don't care about\nthat energy of thenucleus in this case.So the energy of the\nelectron is thekinetic plus the potential.So the kinetic energy, we're\nsaying it's 1/2 mv squaredbecause it's Newtonian\nmechanics apply.See number 3.So that's 1/2 mv squared,\nwhere v is the velocity.So that's the kinetic,\nand then what'sthe potential energy?The potential energy here\nis electrostatic.Because that's the energy that's\nstored here is due tothe Coulombic forces\nbetween them.So that's going to be q1,\nq2 over 4 pi epsilon0 divided by r.So what I'm going to do here, we\nhave to just for conventionI'm going to always choose that\nq1 in my derivation, q1will be the charge on the\nnucleus. so q1 will equal z,which is the proton\nnumber here, timesthe elementary charge.", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.124}, {"text": "Remember e is the elementary\ncharge.It's not the charge\non the electron.So sometimes I use the\nword e with a minussign, meaning the electron.But this is e meaning the\nelementary charge.z times e and then q2, which is\nthe charge on the electron,is minus the elementary\ncharge e.So we're always going to\nhave minus e out here.What varies is z.And so we're going to make\nsome substitutions.So this is going to be what?It's going to be 1/2 mass of the\nelectron times velocity ofthe electron squared.And now q1 is ze and\nq2 is minus z, sothat's minus ze squared.And then that'll be over\n4 pi epsilon 0 r.And I'm going to call this\nthing equation 1.And by the way you can find\nall of this information bylooking at your table\nof constants.So see, epsilon 0\nsitting here.Permittivity of vacuum.There it is, 8.85 times 10 to\nthe minus 12 farads per meter.Elementary charge 1.6 times 10\nto the minus 19 Coulombs.Electron mass, 9.1 times 10 to\nthe minus 31 kilograms. Andwhat's this 4 pi epsilon\n0 doing here?Well we know this is going\nto give us joules.And this is going to\ngive us joules.And the epsilon 0 is the\nfactor that renderselectrostatic units on\nto the same planeas mechanical units.If I plug in-- this is going to\nbe Coulombs, it's Coulombssquared, and this is going to be\nmeters, and now this thingsis farads per meter.And I got farads per meter\ntimes meters divided byCoulombs squared.I don't care.This, with impunity is joules.Because this is an\nenergy unit.And this is Systeme\nInternationale.And this is kilograms times\nmeters per second, meters per", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.113}, {"text": "second and how many apples\nin a bushel and--forget it!Put this in kilograms. Put this\nin in meters per second.With impunity, it's in joules.So that's what that\nthing does there.Alright.Good.So let's keep going.Postulate 3.Newtonian mechanics applies\nto orbiting electrons.So orbiting electron, it's\nin a stationary orbit.So that's the thing.So postulate 3 implies that the\nsum of the forces actingon the electron must be 0.This is a force balance,\nright?If the forces are out of\nbalance, the electrons areeither going to move closer to\nthe nucleus or move fartherfrom the nucleus.So that's equal to, again--it's a sum of a dynamic force\nand a Coulombic force, orelectrostatic.Here I just noticed a\nnice parity here.So these are technical terms,\nbut we can give them humanterms. So the dynamic force,\nthere's a Newtonian force,this is a Newtonian force and\nthis is a Coulombic force,after the two people that are\nassociated with the ideas.Charges interaction\nare Coulombic,blah, blah, blah, blah.So now lets substitute in.So we know that if you've got\nsomething orbiting, somethingtethered, then the dynamic force\non that, that pulls theobject away on a tether\nis mv squared over r.And the electrostatic is q1 q2\nover 4 pi epsilon 0 r squared.Force goes as 1 over\nr squared.Energy goes as 1 over r.How do you know?Well, one way to think about it\nis, you know energy is theresult of a force moving\nthrough a distance.You say, I'm working really\nhard, and I say I don't seeany force moving through\na distance.", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.1},

to get natural log of\nr, which makes no sense.That's one way.Or the other way is, you\ncan just remember.So anyways we're going to\nplug into those values.And what do we get?What we get there is this.We get mv squared over r.q1 is z times e.\nq2 is minus z.So it's minus ze squared over\n4 pi epsilon 0 r squared.And I'm going to call\nthis equation 2.So now we keep going.Next one, energy quantized\nthrough its angular momentum.This is really critical.This is the major breakthrough\nby Bohr.Now what do we mean\nby quantization?I told you that in 1909,\nMillikan had figured out thatelectrical charge\nis quantized.Now quantization had already\nbeen annunciated byMax Planck in 1909.You see, the classical theory\nof radiation gave thisprediction for intensity as\na function of wavelength.They called this the\nexplosion, thecollapse of the theory.As you go to low wavelength,\nthe intensitygoes without abatement.But these are the spectra\nthat were measured.Depending on the temperature\nof the gas, you get thisdistribution.So how to get the distribution\nto turn around at lower valuesof wavelength?And in order to do that, Planck\nsuggested that light iscomposed of energy packets,\nor quanta.That light is a stream of\nindividual energy bits.And the elementary unit of\nelectromagnetic radiation isthe photon.And you can say, well I don't\nunderstand, wheregoes he get that from?", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.119}, {"text": "That's not the way to\nthink about it.Say, if you make\nthis assumptionyou get these curves.And then figure out\nwhat it means.You can't make

proportionality\nconstant is h, which we nowhave designated the Planck\nconstant in honor of Planck,then you get this.People grew to accept it.1900, he gets a Nobel\nPrize for it.La de da!But who knows what\nlight is anyways.It has no mass, it's\nkind of mysterious.1900, the whole concept of\naction at a distance wasstrange to people.The notion that something could\naffect you, from me,without physical contact,\nthis was a new idea.We take it for granted,\nbut this was very new.So it's kind of mysterious,\nthey said, OK, he's aphysicist, who knows?And it worked!But it's light.Now what Bohr is going to say\nis the electron moving inorbit, he says, I'm going to\napply the same concept ofquantization to the electron\nmoving in orbit.Well, that's different.And using this value he gives\nus mvr, which is the angularmomentum is quantized\nn h over 2 pi.h is the Planck Constant\nand n is an integer.1, 2 3 4, et cetera.So this is the quantum condition\nand this will beequation 3.And I have
