last timeto get you back\ninto where we were.We were talking\nabout different typesof technologies that\nuse the stuff you'llbe learning in 22.01.Everything ranging from nuclear\nreactors for producing power,and the Cherenkov radiation\nthat tells you-- well,that the beta particles\nare moving fasterthan the speed of\nlight in water.It's a neat thing, too.I've actually been\nto this reactorat Idaho, to the\nspent fuel pool.Even the spent fuel, once\nit comes out of the reactor,is still giving\noff betas and stillgiving off Cherenkov radiation.And you can tell how long\nit's been out of the reactorby how dim the glow gets,\nwhich is pretty cool.So you can tell how old a fuel\nassembly is by the blue glow.So remember, I told you\nguys, if someone says,oh, you're nuclear,\ndo you glow green?You can be like, no, it's blue.That's the right way of things.We talked about\nfusion energy and gotinto some of the nuclear\nreactions involvedin fusion energy.And I'll be teaching you\nmore about these today.Why fission and\nfusion work, it allhas to do with the\nstability and bindingenergy of the nuclei involved.And that'll be the\nmain topic for today,is excess mass, binding\nenergy, nuclear stability.We looked at medical\nuses of radiation,from implanting\nradioactive seeds calledbrachytherapy seeds in certain\nplaces to destroy tumors,to imaging, to X-ray therapy,\nto proton therapy usingaccelerators, or cyclotrons,\nto accelerate protons and sendthem into people.If you remember, last\ntime we ran the SRIM codeof the stopping range\nof ions and matter,and actually showed\nthat protons allstop at a certain\ndistance in tissue,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.445}, {"text": "depending on their energy and\nwhat you're sending them into.Let's see-- we talked\nabout brachytherapy.We talked about\nradiotracers, and thisis going to be one of the\nother main topics for today, isthese decay diagrams,\nand figuring out not onlywhat products are made,\nbut what energy levels dothe nuclei have, and\nhow do you calculatethe energy of the\nradioactive decayproducts and the recoil\nnuclei, which do take awaysome of the energy.We talked about one\nway to get rich.If you guys can figure\nout one of the waysto solve this moly-99 shortage.Right now, it's mostly\nmade in reactors.The future has got\nto be acceleratorsor some sort of\nswitchable devicewhere you don't need\nto construct a reactorto make these medical isotopes\nfor imaging, and tracers,and such.And finally, we\ngot all the way upto space applications,\nshielding, crazy, differenttypes of shielding, like\nelectromagnetic shielding,to protect from high\nenergy protons, all the wayto radiothermal generators,\nwhich use alpha decayto produce a constant\namount of energyon the order of one to 200\nwatts for like 100 years.And finally, to a\ndifferent configurationof nuclear reactors,\nwhere you candesign them to produce thrust,\nnot necessarily electricity.And that's where we\nstopped on Friday.So let's move on to one\nof the things I'd alludedto earlier, which is\nsemiconductor processing.This is actually a diagram\nfrom the MIT reactor,because we have\nthis beam port here.Has anyone got to\nsee the silicon beamport at the MIT reactor?Oh, seven, eight--\nOK, about half of you.For those who haven't,\nwho here has nothad a nuclear reactor tour?Oh man.OK.Well, you'll get one\nwhen you get to controlthe thing in early October.So you actually get to go\ndown to the control roomand see the rest\nof what's going on.So make sure to ask them,\nshow us the beam portfor silicon ingots.And I think I already told you\nthe story about the poor UROPwho held the ingots\nup to their chest,getting about 10 months of\ndose, which is not dangerous,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.626}, {"text": "but it meant that\nfor 10 months, theycould have no\nradiation exposure,and they had to\nanswer the phone.So that's how we ensure\nsafety around here.There's other ones that--applications that\nyou're probablycarrying around in your pocket.You can use the\nfact that chargedparticles have very\nfinite ranges in matterto separate little bits of\nthat matter from other things.So this is actually how\nsingle-crystal sapphirescan be separated in little\nslivers for protective phonecovers, because sapphire\nis one of the most--the hardest, or the most\nscratch-resistant materialsthere is.Single-crystal sapphire\nis exceptionally strong,and optically transparent,\nand expensive.I know that because on\none of our experiments,we use a single-crystal sapphire\nwindow to see into reactorconditions at like 150\natmospheres, and 350degrees Celsius, and\npretty corrosive chemistry.So you want to use as\nlittle as possible.So you can use a big,\nexpensive acceleratorto limit the amount of\nsapphire that you use.And this is actually\ndone here in Boston.There's a facility not far from\nhere that uses an accelerator.And this is their\nsuper detailed diagramof what the radiation\nlooks like--yeah, whatever.But what they do is they\ntake-- they accelerate protons.They send them through\nbending magnetsto steer that beam path.And then they send\nthem into a large pieceof single-crystal sapphire,\nwhich is exceptionallyexpensive to make.And they can actually\nlift off a thin sliverwith micron precision.The reason for that\nis the same reasonthat we showed with\nthat SRIM code.If you have this exact\nenergy of protonsgoing into well-known\nmatter, youknow what its range is going\nto be with an uncertaintyor so of about a micron.So you can have things that\ncome out thin, uniformlythick, and smooth, right away.There's some other\nreally wacky products--like has anyone heard of\nthese betavoltaic batteries?No?They rely on beta decay or the\ndirect capture and electricity", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.403}, {"text": "generation from a\nradiation sourcelike radioactive tritium.So in this little chip is about\n2 curies worth of tritium.You guys will learn\nin about a week,how to go from activity\nin curies to mass,or something like that.And so this chip\nactually containsa lot of radioactive\ntritium thatdirectly creates electricity.So you can hook into\nthat chip and producenanowatts for years.So it's one of these\nbatteries that lasts-- well,as long as a couple half-lives\nof the isotope that's inside.Now there's a trade-off here.The shorter the\nhalf-life, the more activea given isotope will be for\nthe same number of atoms,but the shorter it will last.So you can have higher power\nfor lower time, or lower power,higher time.It's the classic\nenergy trade-off--works the same way\nwith irradiation.And so now I wanted\nto get into someof the more technical\nstuff, wherewe'll be talking about\nnuclear mass and stability.And this is where the nuclear\nstuff really begins in 22.01.First, I want to make sure\nthat we all agree on notation.So I'll be writing isotopes\nin this sort of fashion,where we refer to A as\nthe atomic mass, or justthe total number of nucleons.This is not the exact\nmass of a nucleus.It just refers to the sum\nof the protons and neutronsin the nucleus itself.And a lot of what we'll\nbe talking about todayis the difference between\nthis nice integer mass number,and the actual mass\nof the nucleus,and that difference is\ngiven by the binding energy,or the excess mass, which\nare directly related.Z is just referred to\nas the atomic number,or the number of protons.It's what makes the\nelement what it,which makes the name\nkind of redundant.But it's-- humans\nlearned by association.It's easier to remember\nelement names or symbolsthan which element is which\njust by the number of protons.So a lot of times we'll use the\nname, or at least the symboljust so we know what's going on.And anything up here is\nsome sort of a charge.I do want to warn you guys of\nthe dreaded multiple symbol", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.279}, {"text": "use or multiple use of symbols.I'll try to stick\nfor a lower case q--will be charged.And uppercase Q\nis going to referto the Q value or the\nenergy consumed or releasedby a nuclear reaction.So they're both Q's\nbut we're going to keepone upper and lower case.And like we mentioned\nbefore, let'ssay we were to write a\ntypical nuclear reaction,like the capture of\nneutrons by boronto produce lithium-7,\nhelium-4, betterknown as an alpha particle,\nand some amount of energy.There's two places where we\nactually use this reaction.One of them is as control rods.A lot of reactors use\nboron for carbide,or this compound B4C, which\nis conveniently solid, fairlydense, and contains a whole\nlot of boron in one place.Specifically,\nenriched in boron-10,because boron-10 has a high\ncross section, or probability,for neutron capture.And the other one\nis in what's calledboron neutron capture therapy.Have I discussed this with\nyou guys already, BNCT?Good, because\nthat's what we'll betalking about for a few slides.And to write this whole\nreaction is the same thingas writing this shorthand\nnuclear reaction.So this is often how you\nsee them in the reading,and in papers, because\nit's shorter to do that.But it's the exact same thing.So I have a couple of\nquestions for you guys then.I have this extra Q here.Where does that Q actually go?So let's say boron\nand neutron absorb,it produces two nuclei with\ndifferent binding energies.What happens to\nthe excess energycreated from the conversion\nof mass to energy?Yeah, Alex?AUDIENCE: That could be heat.MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.And heat, and more specifically?AUDIENCE: Kinetic energy.MICHAEL SHORT: Kinetic energy\nof the radiation released.And so that kinetic\nenergy is actuallyused to our benefit in BNCT, or\nBoron Neutron Capture Therapy.The way this works--once I hit play--is you can either-- you can use\nany sort of source of neutrons,", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.481}, {"text": "either a reactor\nor an accelerator,through a lower complex\nchain of events, like this.In this case, an accelerator--\nso you don't need a wholereactor--fires a beam of\nhigh-energy protonsinto a beryllium target.Does that sound fairly familiar?Firing something at\nberyllium, releasing neutrons,like what Chadwick was doing?Except he was firing\nalpha particles into it.This releases neutrons.What they don't have labeled\nhere is slowing down stuff,or probably\nhydrogenous material,so that the neutrons slow\ndown to a lower energy.And their probability\nof capture increasesor their cross\nsection increases.And if you don't know\nwhat a cross section is,the definition is\ntwo slides away.And the idea here is that these\nneutrons then enter the brainor wherever the\ntumor happens to be.And we rely on the fact that\ntumor cells consume resourcesmuch faster than regular cells,\nespecially neurons, whichafter you're about five,\ndon't tend to grow very much.So it's all downhill by the\ntime you enter kindergarten.And we use that to our advantage\nso that the neutrons coming inwill hit the cancer cells,\nwhich will preferentiallyuptake the borated\ncompounds, leaving mostof the normal cells intact.And the difference in\ndose can be a factor of 5or a factor of 10.So that the cancer gets fried\nwhile doing as little damageas possible to the remaining\nbrain cells, of which wehave fewer and fewer every day.So I say statistically\nspeaking youguys are probably\nsmarter than meif we go by number of\nneurons in your brain,because I think I'm the\noldest person in the room.And so now we can start to\nexplain, how does BNCT work,and why did we make the\nchoices that we did?For example, they use\n30 MeV protons in orderto induce these neutrons.So we have a nuclear reaction\nthat looks something like this.We start off with\nberyllium-9 plus a proton--let's just call it\nhydrogen to stickwith our normal notation--and becomes-- well, can someone\nhelp me balance this reaction?We know we get a neutron.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.507}, {"text": "What else is left?So Monica, what would you say?AUDIENCE: Let's see--MICHAEL SHORT: Even just say\nnumber of protons and neutrons,and we'll figure out\nthe symbol later.AUDIENCE: Number of\nprotons should be--MICHAEL SHORT: Sorry,\noh, that's a 4.AUDIENCE: The number of\nprotons should be five.MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.Five protons, which\nmeans it's boron.And number of neutrons\nin the nucleus?Someone else?Yeah?AUDIENCE: Nine.MICHAEL SHORT: Nine.So we have boron-9.Not a stable isotope of boron,\nbut it doesn't really matter,because boron-9 almost\nimmediately decays intoan alpha, and an\nalpha, and a hydrogen.But this nuclear\nreaction right hereis what we'll be studying\nfor a little bit.And there'll also be\nsome amount of energy.And this Q can actually\nbe positive or negative.No one said there had\nto be energy releasedin a nuclear reaction,\nbecause in this case,we actually start off with 30\nMeV protons and roughly zeroMeV beryllium.If you want to get\nreally exact, it'son the order of\nabout 0.01 eV, whichis why we neglect the\nkinetic energy of berylliumat room temperature.There are other\nreactions that whenyou fire a proton\ninto them will produceneutrons, such as the\nabsorption of lithium.But can anyone think\nof why we'd want to useberyllium instead of lithium?Kristin, what do you think?What could be a bad thing\nabout using lithium?You ever throw in water?AUDIENCE: No.MICHAEL SHORT: OK.Then I should show\nyou what happenswhen you throw it in water.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.402}, {"text": "There's a few bad\nthings about lithium.It does this when you\nthrow it in water.It's one of the alkali metals.It's got an awfully\nlow melting point.It reacts with oxygen to\nproduce an oxide almostinstantaneously.So if you ever take a\nlithium battery apart,which you shouldn't, but if\nyou watch the video of somebodyelse doing it, you'll see that\nthe lithium foil turns blackalmost instantly.It also has a pretty\npoor thermal conductivityand doesn't hold that structural\nintegrity when it melts.So it's not that good\nof a target to use.Beryllium's pretty cool\nin that it's the lighteststructural material there is.Folks tend to make\nsatellites outof it, because it\ncosts a lot of moneyto launch things into space.And if you want something\nthat has a high melting point,and is light, and is structural,\nberyllium's your way to go.It also happens to be a\ngreat neutron generator.And then why 30 MeV?In this case, we're going\nto use a table called JANIS,which I've got open over here.And I just have to clone my\nscreen so you can see it.This is a resource that I think\nyou guys are going to be usingquite a lot in this course.We have a link to it on\nthe learning module site.And I'm going to show you\nhow it works right now.So I tend to use the web\nversion because it workson any browser, any computer.And now you can start to pick\nwhich nuclear reaction you'relooking at.And you can get\ntabulated cross sections.So I'm going to start by\nzooming all the way out.We can pick our\nincident particle.Since in this\ncase, we're lookingat the firing of\nprotons into beryllium,I'll pick the incident\nproton data right here.There's a lot of different\ndatabases with sometimesconflicting information.I tend to go with the most\nrecent one you can find.And click on cross sections.And this is, again another\ntable of nuclides, anythingin green there's data for.Anything in gray, there isn't.So let's go all the way\nback to the light nuclei,zoom in, go back down\nto the light nuclei", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.514}, {"text": "again until we find beryllium-9.Double-click on that, and\nlet's look for the anythingcross section.And this is a pretty\nwide energy scale.So you can actually change\nyour X minimum and maximum.So let's change it to\na minimum and maximum--I don't know-- a\nmaximum of 50 MeV.We don't have to see all of\nthat other stuff going on.50 MeV and maybe\na minimum of 10.If you notice-- actually,\nI'll go back to 1.And I want to point\nsomething out.You can actually get a\ngood yield of beryllium.Let's see-- you can actually\nget a good yield of neutronsby firing protons at\nberyllium in lower energies.But I notice there's\nthis interesting featureright around there.The cross section's flatter.And so if you want to get an--ensure that you\nget the right dose,you might want to deal\nwith a flatter crosssection or a flatter\nprobability region,so that you have\nsomething more predictableinstead of in a really\nhigh slope region.But some of these\nnuclear reactionsactually take extra energy\nin order to move forward.And we'll show you another\nexample pretty quickly.Let's go back to\nour slides here.Then another question\nis, how does the borononly get into the cancer cells?Like we mentioned\nbefore, cancer cellsare actively\ngrowing, which meansthey need a very large\nand active blood supply.And so it's one way for\nthings to, let's say,not quite cross the\nblood-brain barrier.If the cancer cells are growing\nand your neurons aren't, thenyour cancer cells are going\nto use more energy, takein more sugar, which\nmight be doped with boron,or some other compound\ndoped with boron,and that's all you can get\nthe boron into the cellsthat you want.And then why was boron\nselected for the therapy?Let's think about that.What happens after the\nneutron is created?And let's write the next\nstage of the reaction.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.378}, {"text": "In boron neutron\ncapture therapy,we rely on doping the patient\nwith boron-10 to releasean alpha particle, and\nlithium-7 and a gamma ray.So

nucleus had\nan energy of about zero eV.And in the end, all this\nstuff here has gained or lostsome sort of energy\ncue, Q.

colored\nby half-life.In general, the blue\nones will be stable,and the further away you get\nfrom blue, the less stablethey get.So right away, without even\ndelving deeper, what patternsdo you guys notice here?Yeah, Alex?AUDIENCE: As they get bigger,\nheavier, they're more unstable.MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.There's a whole section\nwhere there's no more blue.There are no stable elements.So stability drops off\nafter a certain point.And what about in the\nregion of stable isotopes?Does anybody notice any\nrepeating patterns here?Take a look at every other row.There's a bunch of\nblues and then one,and then a bunch and then one,\nand then more and then none.That must be technetium,\nbecause that'sthe only element around\nthere that doesn't have any.And then a bunch of blues.So every other row--and in this case, it's\nincreasing number of protons--", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.349}, {"text": "has more or fewer\nstable isotopes.It turns out that\nthe even numberedisotopes have a lot more stable\nones, for reasons that we'llget into pretty soon.If you zoom in a\nlittle bit, you cansee all the different\nisotopes so youcan select which ones you want.And again, if you look\nreally closely, that's--let's say, neon right here\nhas got a few stable ones.Sodium has one.Magnesium as three.Aluminum has one.And this pattern\nrepeats all the way upto the point where\nyou don't reallyget any more stable isotopes.If you double-click\non one of them,you get all the\ninformation that you'llneed for the next three\nor so weeks of the course.So in this case, I\npicked on

less than 32,32 being the mass number, or\nthe total number of protonsplus neutrons in the nucleus.The actual mass is a\nlittle lower by that amountright there, the binding energy.It might be a little\nfunny because I'vegiven you a mass in AMU, and a\nbinding energy in kiloelectronvolts.I want to remind you that\nthese are the same thing.The conversion factor you'll\nbe using over and over

much\nmass as when you started.Or in some cases, you might\nhave a little more massthan when you started if things\nare particularly unstable.And you can use the excess\nmass and binding energiesin

about 70?Too small-- all right, let's\nmeet somewhere in the middle--68.Still a pretty high\nbinding energy,but you can look at\nit as a differencein binding energy per nucleon.So in this case,

experimental\ncalculations pretty well--surprisingly so.I want to jump back\nto here, because I'vementioned cross sections,\nand I want to actually definewhat a cross section is,\nbecause this is a

along.And there's a few different\nways of calculatingthat binding energy.You can do it by\nthe excess mass.You can do it by--let's go back to the\ntable of nuclidesso I can show you\nhow I would do it.Let's start with sulfur 32.And we'll write up the\nquantities that we're--that we know.Let's say the excess\nmass is the actual massminus the mass number.The binding energy is Z times\nmass of

binding energiesthat we see right here from\ntabulated excess mass values,atomic number, mass number,\nand the masses of a hydrogenatom and a neutron,\nwhich, for reference,I'll write up here as

calculate\neither the excess mass,or the binding energy, or the\ntotal mass of any nucleus,you can start to\nput them togetherinto nuclear reactions.So since you asked, let's\ntake a quick look at them.Where is our nuclear\nreaction board?Anyone mind if I hide\nthis board for now,so we can go back\nto our original?OK.Let's take a look at\nthis reaction righthere, the actual boron neutron\ncapture therapy reaction.And now we can get towards\ncalculating this Q, whatthe difference is between the--the total energies of the\nproducts and the reactants,and where does that go?So now we can either\nlook up or calculatethe binding energy of\neach of these nuclei,subtract off the energy of the\ngamma, which I've looked upalready, is about 0.478 MeV.And we can figure out what the\ntotal Q of this reaction is.So in this case--I'll skip ahead\nto the slide whereI've got it because that way\nI won't write anything wrongon the board--got everything right up here.We assume that both\nboron and the neutronhave roughly zero\nkinetic energy.And at the end,\nthey come out withsome other kinetic energies\nas well as this gamma ray.The sum of this energy\ndifferences, we refer to as Q.And we can actually\nconfirm this total Qwith a few different methods.In this case, it's always\nconserve something.That's the whole\ntheme of this course,is you can conserve\ntotal masses,you can conserve total\nkinetic energies.We may not know those, but\ntabulated in the KAERI tableare the binding energies\nof each of these nuclei.So let's try that out right now.So let's look at the\nbinding energies of eachof these nuclei and see\nwhat the difference is,the total energy released.First of all, what's the binding\nenergy of a lone neutron?", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.432},
