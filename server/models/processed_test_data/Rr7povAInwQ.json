[{"text": "- Hi, everyone.Happy New Year, happy 2021.\n(gentle music)Sitting here in Washington, DC,right outside of what is\nincreasingly becoming a war zone,because this week there is a, hopefully,peaceful transfer of power\nfrom one leader to another.Anyway, let's talk about journalism.I sort of stumbled into journalism.At first I wanted to be like\na cinematographer, filmmaker.Then I wanted to be a\ndiplomat and I wanted tojoin the Foreign Service\nfor the United States.Then I learned that I didn't\nwanna do either of those thingsand that I could actually\ncombine ingredients from bothto do this thing called journalism,communicating kind of complex topicsof the day to an audience.I didn't go to journalism school,I didn't formally study this,but I ended up becoming what\nmost would call a journalist.Over the years I've learneda few things about journalismthat I wanna share with you.- [Narrator] I assign a reporter to getall the important facts\nand to write the story.I also assign a news\nphotographer to take pictures.The recorder and photographer\nwill work together as a team.Now the reporter has all the facts.He's ready to write his story.He puts the most important facts\nin the first few sentences.Then he adds the interesting details.- So let's make a list here.\n(bright music)Number 1: \"Objectivity is a myth.\"There's no such thing as objectivity.I often find myself in these conversationswhere people are just like,\"If there was just\nunbiased, objective news,all of our problems in the\nmedia would just go away.\"That's a really attractive\nidea, but the more I do this,the more I realize that\nobjectivity isn't a thing,it's a theory.It's not a real thing\nyou can ever achieve.Every article you read,\nevery video you watch,every photo you see was\nproduced by a human beingwho went out and gathered that informationand then decided what\nfacts to put down on paper.They chose to frame the\nissue a certain way,to leave out some stuff\nand to include other stuff.There were choices there.And those choices were the productof a human and their biases.Even a photo journalist,someone who takes pictures for newspapers,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.101}, {"text": "presumably the least bias type\nof journalism there can be,is still totally subject to bias.The way that photo is cropped and framed,and who they decided to take\na photo of, and at what time,and how they decided to expose the frame,all of those are choices.Objectivity is a myth.But what isn't a myth, and what's real?And I think what people\nare sort of getting atwhen they talk about\nobjectivity, is fairness.Being fair to your topic, or your subject,or the other side of the argumentthat you're making in your article.My old boss Ezra Klein\n(gentle music)used to talk about this\nconcept as generosity.We, as journalists go out and gathera bunch of information\nand facts about a thing,and then we sort of land somewhereon what we think about that topic.And our journalism, our story,is gonna reflect that decision.But what you can do as a fair journalistis you could be generous\nto the other side.You can present the best versionof the other side's argument.That to me is what healthy journalism has,is generosity to the other side.But objectivity, it just doesn't exist.I experienced this in the\nfirst season of \"Borders\"when I was in Japan doing\nthat North Korea bubble story.I clearly had a position in that story,but at the same time, I wanted\nto give the best version,the most generous version, of\nthe North Korean viewpoint.And I tried to split that balancewhile also being clear and\nassertive about the facts.That's a difficult balance,\nbut when it's done right,it makes for better journalism.Number 2: \"A lot of journalistswrite for their peers and\nnot for their audience.\"This is another really\n(gentle music)useful thing that I learned\nfrom Ezra Working at \"Vox.\"A lot of journalism is hard to understand,that's just a fact.Like even now when I read\nthe \"Wall Street Journal\"or the \"Washington Post\"\nor the \"New York Times,\"I have a hard time getting\naround some of the languageand some of the things that are happening,especially for topics\nthat I'm sort of new to.I've always felt this.And it's always sort of been\nfrustrating, 'cause I'm like,\"Aren't you guys writing\nso that I understand?Like, I'm an educated\nconsumer of this newsand yet I'm having a\nhard time understanding.\"Like, that's a problem.A lot of journalism is\nwritten for insiders.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "People who are already kind\nof familiar with the topic.As a journalist,when you're writing about\nsomething that's kind of complex,you start to sort of get in your head.You're like, \"Man, a lot of\npeople are gonna see this.And a lot of really smart\npeople are gonna see this.So if I use really simple language,what are my peers gonna think?What are my journalists\nfriends down the roadat the \"Washington Post\"\nor the \"New York Times\"gonna think about this articleif I don't use all the fancy jargon?\"If I'm explaining the\nfinancial crisis in Venezuela,it's a lot more tempting\nto write something like,\"Hyperinflation has led to\nthe complete devaluationof the local currencies\nspurring a collapse in wages,\"which shows my peers that\nI'm actually really smart.I have a Master's degreein International Relations and Economics.But what about my audiencewho knows nothing about hyperinflation?They're left feeling left\nout and no more informedabout the financial crisis in Venezuela.Instead, what I should do\nis write something like,quote, \"Situation has\ngotten so bad in Venezuelathat the money is worth\na thousand times lessthan it was last year,making those who were once really richnow struggling to find their next meal.\"It's still accurate.It's still smart.And it's still an accurate assertionabout what's happening in Venezuela.I'm just not using any of the jargon.If my peers judge me for that, so be it.At least my audience will understand.Number 3: \"Journalism has a lotof very old customs or traditions.\"There are a lot of old practices\nand habits in journalismthat feel like gospel to a\nlot of people in journalism.One of the big ones that I always run intois that in sort of traditional\nconventional journalismwe don't say the word \"I.\"\n(light music)The journalist is a fly on the wall,we're not there to insert ourselves,our personal character into the story,therefore we don't say the word, \"I.\"And I sort of understand\nthe thinking behind thateven if I don't practice it.The other convention or custom,mainly in like documentary\nand video journalism,is that we're not here to make\nthings look too beautiful.Beautiful B-roll, evocative music,beautiful motion graphics,", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "those are for like the brands\nand the corporate people.Here in journalism we care about\"The story\".\n(drums boom)And all the fancy stuff is just\nfluff, not necessary at all.I disagree with both of those.I disagree with the aversion to using \"I,\"and I disagree with the aversion to usingbeautiful imagery and B-roll and music.Luckily, when I came into journalism,I came into an organization\nthat was very eagerto disrupt this old set\nof customs in journalism.\"Vox\" really encouraged me to experiment.Thank goodness they did.I was able to start a\nseries that was all aboutshowing beautiful visuals\nof places around the world,and it had music and\nit had motion graphics.And of course, it had a lot of\nturning the camera on myselfand talking to the camera.I was a character in the story,and I would go to these conferences,these journalism conferences,and I would always get\nsort of interrogatedby these legacy news people who were like,\"Can you really consider this journalism?\"And my response was always, \"I don't know.Like, you can decide,I'm not here to chase\nthe label of journalism.I'm here to tell stories about peopleand to bring big audiences\nto those stories.\"The reality is a lot of these customsare sort of arbitrary\nand they were developedat a different time when\ninformation was shared differently.Let me caveat just one big thing hereby saying that a lot of these norms,and a lot of these customs\nand ethics within journalism,are actually really useful.The idea of staying honest and fact-based,and accurate, and making\nsure that your assertionsactually have some evidence to them,I am all for that.I love that there is a\nvery strong traditionand burden of evidence\nwithin journalism that says,\"If you can't prove it, it's not real,\"especially because a lot of those customs,which I believe are the\nreally important customsof factual information, are\nsort of going out the window.And if you need proof of that,just go five miles away\nfrom me to the Capitol,like a week ago,and see how that was covered\nby journalists on both sides.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "When it comes to the formats, the,\"Oh, that guy turned\nthe camera on himself\"or, \"Did a bunch of drone shotsand therefore it's not journalism.\"I'm here to tell stories that have facts,and data, and characters\nand help inform people.If you decide to call\nthat journalism or not,I don't really care.It's how I do it.But I guess the lesson here is thatif you're going into journalism,those are really serious intense customsthat you will come in contact with.Which gets me to my next\nlesson which is number 4:\"Journalism school isn't\nalways the best wayto get into journalism.\"Now, let me just pause for a secondand make it clear that I am not sayingdon't go to journalism school.Most of the people who\nhave taught me what I knowabout the craft of journalism\nwent to journalism schooland I am deeply grateful.Thank you, Joss Fong and othersfor teaching me how to do journalismwhen I frankly didn't\nknow what I was doingwhen I walked in the door,\nthe first day at \"Vox\".But, let me make it clear\n(bright music)that going to journalism\nschool is not the onlyor even the best way\nto get into journalism.Man, I've said journalism,\nthe word journalism,so many times in this videoit's starting to get\nto the point where likethe word feels weird to say,\nbecause I've said it so much.So anyway, my critique\nof journalism schoolis the same critique\nI have of film school,which is something I started and stoppedafter about a year and a half.The critique for both of these is thatthe institution spends so\nmuch time focusing on theory,tradition, history, critique\nof the old style of doing it,the old way of doing filmmaking,or the old way of doing journalism,that they don't give\nthe students much chanceto actually experiment and play aroundwith like, the new versions of\nhow this thing is being done.We spend so much time looking\nback and talking to facultywho sort of had their heyday\nin, like, the old days,that they don't spend a lot of timedoing the type of journalism\nthat happens today,which is under very\ndifferent circumstanceseconomically, politically, et cetera.So, my big critique is thatthere isn't enough, in the trenches,experience with journalism,", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and that you ended up getting a sort ofwarped version of what\nyou're gonna be doing,and a lot of fixed ideas that\nare hard to, sort of shift,when you actually get\nout into the real world.Now, there are a lot of journalism schoolswho are doing really great\nwork in this departmentand letting their students\nsee what it's really like.I go and speak to a lot of\nthese journalism schools,whether it's the University of Oregon,or Stanford, or Yale or whatever it is.When I speak to students at these schoolsI see an appetite from\nfaculty to give these studentsperspective on what\njournalism looks like in 2021.What it looks like in this\nnew age of digital journalism,and what are the different versionsof journalism that one can go into?The big strength of journalism schoolis that they teach you the\nimportance of reporting,I mean, going out and gathering facts,of fairness, of facts,\nof accuracy, of evidence,the heart of journalism you\nlearn in journalism school.Absolutely. That is totally irrefutable.I believe in that,but I believe that you\nget a lot of that fluffon top of the customs and,how you're supposed to do journalism,and what is and what isn't.And those fixed ideas,\nif they root too deeplycan hinder you once you\nget out into the field.Go there, learn, like, go for it,but make sure you don't get too entrenchedon what journalism is and isn't.The next lesson is that:\"Journalism is economic\nin its very nature.\"It has to be, it is a business.Just watched \"Little Women\"\n(bright music)the new one with Hermione,\nit was really good.I watched \"Little Women\"\na bunch growing upbut I'd never really bought it.And then I watched this one\nand it totally made sense.And I loved it.Anyway, there's this amazing\nline in there where she says,- \"So don't sit there\nand tell me that marriageisn't an economic\nproposition because it is.\"- Journalism is an economic proposition,meaning if you're starting\na journalism outletin the United States, you\nare doing so as a business.You need to keep your lights\non and your doors openby selling something,\nwhether it's subscriptions,or whether it's ad's or whether\nit's some other new versionof economic value that you can\ncreate with your journalism.You have to do that.And with that comes a certain set ofexpectations and incentives\nthat aren't necessarily aligned", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "with the incentives of\ntelling really good stories.And now of course,I've ranted about this in\na previous video called,\"Why I hate the news.\"I'm not gonna go into the\ndepths of my thoughts on this.If you want to go watch\nthat video, you should.But, whenever I go to speakat a journalism conference in Europe,I always chat with them about\nthe economics of journalismin Switzerland or the\nNetherlands or whatever.And in Europe they've\nreally realized that like,private media can get out of controland can lead to some really bad outcomes.And so, they really try to bufferthe media machine from private interests,and they do so, and a pretty good job,there's still private media in Europe.But here in the United States,private media is the name of the game.And the effects of these\nincentives on journalismare very apparent.We are incentivized to chase\nvolume, to chasing numbers,to chase like a little bit ofwhat's gonna get people to click?It's hard to compete when\nthe information landscapeincentivizes us to be in that environment.Money usually comes from\nattention and advertisingnot necessarily subscribers whopay a monthly fee for your newspaper.And attention and trafficare not always conducive\nto telling the best storyor doing the best journalism,which is a real travesty.The best thing that took the most time,the biggest article that\nhas the most information,is not actually the most valued\namong the attention economy.But, anyway, I'm not here to lamenthuman psychology.\n(muted cheers)I do offer two pieces of hope to thiscapitalistic incentive\nof the media quandary.Number one is thatthere are still really great outletsthat publish really in-depth mediaand that you just have to pay money to.And by doing so you\nshield the need for themto have to just chase pure volume.One of my favorite outlets of all timeand where I get most of my newsand my ways of thinking about the world,is a British weekly magazine\ncalled \"The Economist.\"And I pay for it.I like to consume media\nthat I know was crafted", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "by the incentives of serving\nme, the paying customer,as opposed to serving a different master,which is an advertiser\nwho will keep them afloat.There's still a lot of amazing mediathat happens through advertiser\nrevenue, but just as a fact,most media had to pivot to that,but, more and more, those\nincentives are pushing mediainto more sensationalized,\npolarized places.Okay, my second\n(bright music)piece of hope here is thatwhen I joined \"Vox\", we were\njust sort of taking off.We had less than 100,000\nsubscribers on YouTube.It was like the early days.And there was this hypothesis\namong the whole organization,which was like a few dozen people,that if we could tell really good stories,and explain really\ncomplicated things to people,that we would actually win the views game,like, people would actually come to usinstead of the funny cat video,because they actually want to understand.People actually want to\nengage with good information.And it turns out that that\nhypothesis was totally correct.The most popular videos\nI ever made at \"Vox\",one, a six minute explainer of\na complex Middle Eastern war,really complicated, but got\nhundreds of millions of views.And another really popular video I madewas a 10 minute video explainingthe housing policy crisis\nand tax law in Hong Kong.Like, some of those boring\nbut important informationyou could ever think of.But, because they were presented in a waythat people could access,it actually made them really popular.And people said, \"Yes,\nI want to understandwhat's going on with the Syrian civil war,because everyone's talking about itand I don't understand it.I will sit through this six minute video.\"And that video by the way, took off,not on YouTube, but on Facebook.Like, the place where people's attentionis apparently the lowest and\nwhere people are just thereto click on whatever's sensational.That's a problem, that's happening,but you can still get people\nto watch really in-depth stuffif it's well told and well presented.So that, that's a hopeful\nthing to my little lamentabout the economics of journalism.Man, I'm getting deep right now.I'm getting like deep into\nmy theories of journalism.Yeah. Yeah.This is good. This is good.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "Let's get onto the next lesson.Number 6: \"Good writing\nis rare and beautiful.\"What I've learned in journalism is thatthe difference between someonereally connecting with a storyand not connecting with a\nstory, is just a few words.Good writing, whether it's for a videoor a text-based article, it\ncan bring you into a story.It can illuminate a topic,\nit can humanize a character.It's really important.I wasn't very good at writing\nwhen I started at \"Vox\".And over the years I had some\nreally good story editorswho would look at my writing and help mereshape it and simplify it,and make it more concise\nand make it clearer.I am grateful for the people\nwho taught me how to write,because, a lot of the videos\nyou see on this channel,yeah, there is beautiful maps,\nand there's fancy footage,and there's lots of\ndrone shots and whatever.But at the end of the\nday, behind all of that,the reason why you're interested\nin watching those videosis because I put a major\npriority on writing.I spent so much time choosing my wordsso that every story I tell\n(bright music)sinks in on the other\nside when you're listeningand that's because good journalismis good writing at the end of the day.And it's incredibly important.If you want to get better at\nwriting, I have a book for you.I'm gonna put the link in the description.If I forget to do that,\ncall me out in the commentsbecause I don't wanna forgetbecause I wanna tell you about this book.I mean, I could just say it right nowand then you can go find it.But oh, but if I put it in\nthis link in the descriptionI could make it an affiliate link,and then I could get money\nevery time you click it.Man, the incentives of\nthe 21st century economyare just playing on my mind right now.Oh gosh.Okay. The last lesson here,\n\"Good journalism is important.\"Now hear me out on this.\n(bright electronic music)This might sound trite, but,I've learned over the years\nthat journalism is hard.To go out and gather informationthat doesn't exist in the worldand to communicate it to the\nrest of the world is hard.Our country, these past few months,has shown me just how importantand how sort of delicate\ngood journalism can be.Facts don't matter for a\nlot of people these days.And before you know it,", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "you can have a person in powercreating fake stories about an election,and you can have a news outletthat claims to be doing journalism,jump on board with that narrativeand make up facts to support it.That's scary!Good journalism, the stuff\nwhere people are going outand actually scrutinizing evidenceand presenting robust\narguments to an audiencethat is scrupulous back towards them,and there's a discussion, a discourse,that's rare and special.Here in the United States we\ncall it the \"Fourth Estate\",this institution of free pressthat keeps our leaders honest,keeps our corporations honest,keeps our society together and honest.There will always be\npeople and institutionswhose sole purpose is to gain.Journalism offers a\nspotlight or a watchdog,on those actors on those institutions.And because of that, it's\nreally, really important.I am very, very grateful\nfor those journalists,especially right now,\nthis time in history,where covering the facts\nis so freaking importantfor keeping our society\npeaceful and together,and honest and working.I just, I'm gratefulfor the good journalism that's happening,the people out there hustling.And I lament the hostilitythat has been shown towards those peopleand I hope we can move on and\nget back to facts and truth.Thanks for watching.This video is sponsored by Squarespacewhich is an all-in-one platformwhere you can create any sort\nof online presence you want,whether it's a portfolio for your videosor for your photography,or you are launching a businessand you want to have an online presencethat isn't just a website,but also a place where\nyou can do email campaignsand SEO so that your\nwebsite shows up on search,or integration with social media.Whatever it is, Squarespace is a placewhere you can create online\npresence that is beautiful.And it's really quick and easy.It's like a drag and drop.A few minutes and you could\nhave a literal websitelive on the internet.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "I love Squarespace, have for a long time,and I'm grateful that\nthey support this channel.There's a link in my descriptionwhere if you click it it\nhelps support this channel,but it also gives you 10% offyour first purchase at Squarespace.Whether it's hosting spaceor a domain name or whatever,you get 10% off if you click that link.Thank you, Squarespace\nfor sponsoring this video.Thank you all for watching.Thank you, Patreons.Like always, like I've\nnow had a Patreon for likemaybe six months or maybe more.And I'm just, I sort of thought like,\"Man, the Patreons are gonna\nbe there for a few minutes,and then like after month or two,they're all just gonna flee.\"But they haven't.And I'm so grateful because\nit helps support my work.I have some very zesty videos coming outin the next couple of weeks.Get ready for those.Just telling you, like,\"How the US Stole the\nMiddle East, Part Two\"I know you have all been asking for it.It's coming.(clicks fingers)\nAll right.See you all in the next one.Have a good day.Happy new year.Bye.- [Newsreel Announcer] This\nis the plan for page 10.Then he writes a headline,\na title for the story.Then the printed story is checked\nagainst the original storyto make certain that\nthere are no mistakes.Warning light.The presses are starting to roll.Newspapers are sold on the streets,newspapers are delivered to homes,and they are read everywhere.I like my job, helping to bring\nthe news to our community.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.0}]
