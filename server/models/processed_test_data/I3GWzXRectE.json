then give you some examples of differential equations from physical sciences and then a little bit of integration towards the end so for for many of you this might be the easiest course here that you'll take in Oxford but I think things will get progressively harder so maybe in a couple of weeks it will be interesting to everybody if today's lecture might be a bit too easy for some of you okay
