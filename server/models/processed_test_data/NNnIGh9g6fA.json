to accept that.Let me give you an example.You are a hamster.You are a female hamster.And you're sitting in your cage.And, as a female\nhamster, what you dois you ovulate every\nfive days or so.And you're going\nabout your business,and everything's great.Now, somebody puts\nanother female hamsterin the cage with you.And over the subsequent month or\nso, what happens is both of youwill begin to\nlengthen your cyclesand eventually synchronize\nthem so that you are bothovulating the same afternoon\non a regular basis.", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.143}, {"text": "Amazing.This actually works this way.And menstrual ovulatory\nsynchrony-- peopleunderstand how this\nworks in hamsters.It is done with olfaction,\nwith pheromones,with chemical airborne signals\nfrom one female to another.And you can prove this\nby electrically recordingfrom olfactory systems.Or, if you don't\nhave much funding,you could take like a paper clip\nover the female hamster's nose,and she doesn't\nsynchronize then.It's all done with olfaction.And what's most amazing is you\nput the two females together,and there is a way\nof disrupting it.Put a male hamster in there,\nand suddenly the cyclesdesynchronize and shorten,\nand you break it upwith male pheromones.And what's even more remarkable\nis you put the two femalestogether, and it's not random\nwho synchronizes the other one.The dominant female synchronizes\nthe subordinate one.Totally understood.People have been working\non this for years.And it works this way in goats,\nand sheep, and dogs, and cats,and pigs.Apparently, you could go to\na 7-Eleven somewhere in Iowa,and you could buy a can of pig\novulatory synchronization sprayand take it home,\nand just run wild.I have no idea why you\nwould want to do that.But nonetheless,\nthat's how you--it's up there with the cans\nof Cheese Whiz or whatever.And it's that well understood.And what's remarkable is it\nworks exactly the same wayin us humans, where it is\nknown as the Wellesley Effect.The fact that over\nthe course of freshmanyear, this was first\nshown in Wellesley, 1970.Over the course of\nfreshman year, women--freshman year roommates-- tended\nto lengthen and synchronizetheir cycles.And it was done with olfaction.Women who had olfactory\ndeficits didn't synchronizewith their roommates.They would synchronize\nunless theywere having close\nintimate relationships", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.196}, {"text": "with a male, in which\ncase they desynchronized.And what's most cruel of\nall is, it's not randomwho synchronizes to who.The studies tend to show is the\nindividual who is more sociallyoutgoing, extroverted,\ndominating, is the one whosynchronizes the other one.And this is well\nenough understoodthat when I went\nin college, peoplewould sit around at the dinner\ntable and say stuff like,Oh, when we roomed\ntogether in the summer,I had her synchronized\nby August 1st.This is what happens if you\nhang out with biologists.But we're exactly the same.The challenge here\nis recognizing thereis nothing fancy about us.At various points\nin the class, wewill look at comparisons between\nthe human and the chimp genome,and it's virtually the same.Some of the time, we are just a\nplain old off-the-rack animal.Second challenge is going to be\ncircumstances where we appearto be just like everybody\nelse, all the other organismsout there, but we\ndo something verydifferent with the similarity.Let me give you an example here.You have two humans,\ntwo individuals,who are going through a ritual.They are sitting at a table.They're absolutely silent.They're making no\neye contact, and theydo nothing more physically\ntaxing than every nowand then, one of them\npicks up their handand moves a little piece\nof wood on the table.And if these happen\nto be the right twoindividuals in the middle of a\nchess grandmaster tournament,these people are\nmaintaining blood pressurefor six hours running that you\nonly see in a marathon runner.These people are going through\nthousands of calories a daydoing nothing more\nthan thinking.And this is outrageous.Because you look at\none of these chessgrandmasters who's just\ntaken down an opponentand took their\nqueen, or whatever,and they will have the\nexact same physiologyas some male baboon\non the Savannahwho's just ripped the stomach\nopen of his worst rival.", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.168}, {"text": "And we're doing it\nthere just with thought.And some of the time what's\nremarkable about us is wehave absolutely typical,\nboring physiology,but we use it in ways that\nno other animal could.We get stressed by the\ninevitability of our mortality.We get stressed by reading\nsomething awful thathas happened to a child on\nthe other side of the planet.We get stressed by\nsomebody zooming past usin some sports car, and\nwe decide that we are noweconomically inadequate.And you never even\nsee the person's face.You just see the car.We get stressed reading about\nsomething awful happeningto a character in a novel.This is a whole realm\nof things that wecould do that nobody else does.And on the flip side, we can\nfeel compassion and empathyfor a loved one.But we can also do\nthe same for someoneon the other side of the\nplanet in a refugee camp.We can feel compassion for\na member of another species.We feel badly when\nour pets are injured.This is another realm where the\nphysiology of the response--the empathy, the emotional\nbonding, all of that--it's the same boring physiology\nas every other animalout there, and we are\nusing it in a way thatis unrecognizable.Now, some of the\ntime the challengeis the third category, which\nis when we are doing somethingthat no other\nanimal out there hasanything remotely similar to.Let me give you an example\nhere, a shocking example.You have a couple.They live together.They come back at the\nend of the day from work.They talk.They eat dinner.They talk some more.They go to bed,\nand they have sex.They talk some more.They fall asleep.The next day, they do\nthe same exact thing.They come home from work.They talk.They eat.They talk.They go to bed.They have sex.They talk some more.They do this every single\nnight for 30 days running.Hippos would be\nrepulsed by this.Because hardly anybody out\nthere in the animal kingdomhas non-reproductive sex,\nlet alone day after day.", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.188}, {"text": "And nobody else out there\ntalks about it afterward.And what we've got here\nis a whole novel domainof human behavior-- language\nuse, aspects of our sexuality,this profoundly damaging\nhuman uniquenessof some individuals confusing\naspects of sexualitywith aggression.In some cases, we are going\nto be out there on our owntrying to understand what's up.OK.So that will be the general\nstrategy for the course.We will resist\ncategorical thinkingover, and over, and over.Not just because that's cool,\nand nuanced, and subtle,all of that.But fall into\ncategorical thinking,and you can do unspeakable\ndamage in a realm of sciencethat makes the difference.We will do so thinking\nconstantly about ourselvesas a boring species just like\nall the others out there.As a species that has the\nsame boring physiology,but uses it in ways\nthat are unrecognizable.As a species that does\nsome things that are simplywithout precedent out

buckets,the various categories.And what we're\ngoing to go throughis understanding an introduction\nto evolutionary theory,an introduction to what\nmolecular genetics hasto do with

the\nsensory stimuli that triggerthose neurons, et cetera?All the way back to the\nevolutionary selectivepressures.So the first half\nof the course isgoing to be the\nintroduction to the buckets.", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.191}, {"text": "And I will tell you\nright off the batit is a total pain in the rear.Because what we're\ngoing to be doingis like every 2.5 lectures--\njust when you were gettingthe vocabulary\ndown-- we're goingto jump to a completely\ndifferent bucket.It is going to be dizzying, and\nunpleasant, and all of that.And then second\nhalf of the course,oh, the rewards finally come\nof then putting all the piecestogether, looking at individual\ncategories of behavior--sexual behavior, aggressive\nbehavior, parental behavior,schizophrenia, depression,\npersonality disorders, languageuse.In each of these cases, what's\ngoing on a second before?What's going on 10\nmillion years before?Where do all these buckets\ndisappear in the interactions?So that's going to be the\nstrategy for the course.Something critical about\nhow the course was designedis it's got no prerequisites.Because I really think this is a\nsubject that everybody on Earthshould be forced to learn\nabout it at gunpoint.And thus, it's a\ngood thing, I think,to have this not be one of\nthose upper level bio classes.Let me just get a\nsense of who's here.How many of you are bio\ntypes, bio majors, hum bio?Psychology?Anthro?Are there any English Lit\ngrad students in here?Yeah.OK.Good for you.Thank you for coming here.See what you think\nin three months.But nonetheless, the class\nhas been designed explicitlyto have no background\nwhatsoever.How are we going to do that?We're going to do the usual song\nand dance of weekly sections,and reviews, and all\nthat sort of thing.But in addition,\nduring this first halfof the course when we're jumping\nfrom category to category,we're going to have each\nweek additional sections--a catchup section--\nwhich is for peoplewho have no background\nin that area,getting you through the\nbasics, and getting youup to speed so that you\nwill be able to then knowwhat's up during the lectures.", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.155}, {"text": "So those will be posted.The first one of these is--\nlet me make sure I've got this.Yes.It will be Thursday at\n7:30 in the room next door.And this is going to\nbe the introductionto evolutionary\ntheory and gettingyou ready for what will be the\nevolution lectures Wednesdayand Friday of this week.If you don't have a\nstrong background,go to these catchup sections.The TAs who will be\ngiving that are reallyexpert in those areas, lots\nof background, and thiswill be your chance to catchup.Look through the handout.I think I have a\nbunch of terms thereor something where if\nyou are not terriblyfamiliar with those terms in\nsome discipline, that's a signthat you should probably go\nfor some of the catchup stuff.If you really are\njust doing this,sort of being very adventurous\nwith no background, if you cantake it pass/fail,\nthat will take offa lot of the pressure as well.Because you could then actually\npay attention to stuff here.And the whole\npoint here is to beable to do this even if\nyou don't have a sciencebackground.Because the obvious\nargument I would makeis everybody has to\nlearn behavioral biologybecause we're being behavioral\nbiologists every timewe serve on a jury.Every time we vote\nwhether or notmoney should be spent\non solving some problem,whether it's a problem, and\nwhether it's solvable or not.Every time we try to\nmake sense of a familymember sunk in depression.Are they having a\nbiochemical disorder,or are they just\nindulging themselves?We're behavioral\nbiologists all the time.So it's probably a good thing\nthat we be informed ones.So the catchup sections\nthere-- take advantage of them.What else?We will have weekly\nsections, the usual type.People are not\nassigned to sections.There's going to be 18 of them\nor so a week at various times.Go to whichever works for you.There will be a midterm in\nthe middle, the midterm comingas we finish the last of\nthose categories, lastof those buckets.There will be a

stand\nup, and just getto the front of the\nline for the bathroom,and then we will resume promptly\nbefore you get in there.So just to let you\nclear your heads a bit.Assignments, books, reading.There are two books that I\nhave assigned for the course.One is by me.And you don't even\nhave to read it.Just go buy a bunch of copies\nof and bring me the receipt,and you've got a\ngreat grade in there.OK, so that's what\nis going to bepertinent to the second\nhalf of the course.We're going to give you a\nlist of the chapters thatmake the most sense to read.The other book is a\nbook by an author namedJames Gleick called Chaos.Chaos, year, after year,\nafter year, in this classprovokes the strongest opinions.A quarter of the\npeople decide itis the most irritating,\nirrelevant thing thatcould possibly have been\nassigned in the classand hate it.About half the\npeople never quitefigure out what's up with it.And a quarter of the people,\ntheir life is transformed.They no longer have to meditate.They no longer have to\nhave a-- they are at peace.At peace, I tell you.Because what this\nbook does is introducethis whole radically different\nway of thinking about biology,taking apart a world\nof reductionism.For 500 years, we all have\nbeen using a very simple modelfor thinking about\nliving systems.Which is, if you want\nto understand somethingthat's complicated, you break\nit apart into its little pieces.And once you understand\nthe little piecesand put it back\ntogether, you willunderstand the complex thing.And what Chaos as an\nentire field is about--and this was pretty\nmuch the first book thatwas meant for the lay public\nabout it-- what Chaos showsis that's how you fix clocks.", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.271}, {"text": "That's not how\nyou fix behaviors.That's not how you\nunderstand behaviors.Behavior is not like a clock.Behavior is like a cloud.And you don't\nunderstand rainfallby breaking a cloud down\ninto its component piecesand gluing them back together.So read through that book.A lot of it is from physical\nsciences rather thanbiological, so we'll\njust be suggestingthe chapters you should read.I will tell you it\nis the first booksince Baby Beluga where\nI've gotten to the last pageand immediately started reading\nit over again from the front.Because along with\nBaby Beluga, it'shad the greatest\ninfluence on my life.I found this to be the most\ninfluential book in my thinkingabout science since college.So that is a sign.There will also be\na bunch of lecturesin the second half of the course\ncovering these fields of chaosand complexity.And if you really\nthink about it,it is going to force a\nchange in everything elsethat you bring to thinking\nabout this subject.In addition, at this moment\nthere is not a reader.Because I'm trying to\navoid having to getyou guys to have\nto buy a reader.I'm trying to redo all\nthe assigned readingsso that will just be from papers\nthat are available online,that you'll be able to download.I'm about halfway through\ngetting them there.With any luck, there will\nnot have to be a reader.But if it does exist,\nit's not going to be big.It won't be terribly expensive.But there will be a bunch of\nreadings online to download,and it will vary.In some cases, it will be\nreading the whole paper.In some cases, I'll\nbe suggesting you justread the abstract.In some cases, it will be to\nunderstand what's happeningin the paper in detail.In some cases,\nthis is an exampleof how people in this bucket\nthink about this problem.Just read the abstract.So all of that will be\nassigned and made clear.What other stuff?There's going to be a huge\namount of information online.The coursework is going to\nbe set up for the class.There will be copies\nof the handouts.There
