the same thing.\nNamely, you can plot its graph.Its graph will be a surface in\nspace.And then, we can try to look\nfor the volume below the graph.And that's what we will call\nthe double integral of

notations when we seehow to actually compute these\nthings.That's the basic definition.\nOK, so actually,how do we define it,\nthat's not really much of adefinition yet.\nHow do we actually define thisrigorously?\nWell, remember,the integral in one variable,\nyou probably saw a definitionwhere you take your integral\nfrom a to b,and you cut it into little\npieces.And then, for each little\npiece, you take the value of afunction, and you multiply by\nthe width of a piece.That gives you a rectangular\nslice, and then you sum all ofthese rectangular slices\ntogether.So, here we'll do the same\nthing.So, well, let me put a picture\nup and explain what it does.So, we're going to cut our\norigin into little pieces,say, little rectangles or\nactually anything we want.And then, for each piece,\nwith the small area, delta A,we'll take the area delta a\ntimes the value of a function inthere that will give us the\nvolume of a small box that sitsunder the graph.\nAnd then, we'll add all theseboxes together.\nThat gives us an estimate of avolume.\nAnd then, to get actually theintegral,\nthe integral will be defined asa limit as we subdivide into\nsmaller and smaller boxes,and we

compute an integral in\nsingle variable calculus,you don't do that.\nYou don't cut into littlepieces and sum the pieces\ntogether.You've learned how to integrate\nfunctions using variousformulas,\nand similarly here,we'll learn how to actually\ncompute these things withoutdoing that cutting into small\npieces.OK, any questions first about\nthe concept, or what thedefinition is?\nYes?Well, so we'll have to learn\nwhich tricks work,and how exactly.\nBut, so what we'll do actuallyis we'll reduce the calculation\nof a double integral to twocalculations of single\nintegrals.And so, for

did was really we took\nslices parallel to an axis oranother one.\nSo, in fact,here, the key is also the same.\nSo, what we are going to do isinstead of cutting into a lot of\nsmall boxes like that

the graphis this paraboloid pointing\ndownwards.OK, it's what you get by taking\na parabola and rotating it.And now, what we are asking is,\nwhat is the volume between theparaboloid and the xy plane

region.\nWell what I am saying is yequals x to y equals square root\nof x.Well, let's draw y equals x,\nand y equals square root of x.Well, maybe I should actually\nput this here,y equals x to y equals square\nroot of x.OK, and so I will go,\nfor each value of x I will go", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.414}, {"text": "from y equals xo to y equals\nsquare root of x.And then, we'll do that for\nvalues of x that go from xequals zero to x equals one,\nwhich happens to be exactlywhere these things intersect.\nSo, my region will consist ofall this, OK?\nSo now, if I want to do it theother way around,\nI have to decompose my region.The other way around,\nI have to, so my goal,now, is to rewrite this as an\nintegral.Well, it's still the same\nfunction.It's still e to the y over y.\nBut now, I want to integrate dxdy.\nSo, how do I integrate over x?Well, I fix a value of y.\nAnd, for that value of y,what's the range of x?\nWell, the range for x is fromhere to here.\nOK, what's the value of x here?Let's start with an easy one.\nThis is x equals y.What about this one?\nIt's x equals y^2.OK, so, x goes from y2 to y,\nand then what about y?Well, I have to start at the\nbottom of my region.That's y equals zero to the\ntop, which is at y equals one.So, y goes from zero to one.\nSo, switching the bounds is notcompletely obvious.\nThat took a little bit of work.But now that we've done that,\nwell,just to see how it goes,\nit's actually going to be mucheasier to integrate because the\ninner integral,well, what's the integral of\ne^y over y with respect to x?It's just that times x,\nright, from x equals y^2 to y.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.319}, {"text": "So, that will be,\nwell, if I plug x equals y,I will get e to the y minus,\nif I plug x equals y^2,I will get e to the y over y\ntimes y^2 into the y times y,OK?\nSo, now, if I do the outerintegral, I will have the\nintegral from zero to one of eto the y minus y^e to the y dy.\nAnd, that one actually is alittle bit easier.\nSo, we know how to integratee^y.\nWe don't quite know how tointegrate ye^y.\nBut, let's try.So, let's see,\nwhat's the derivative of ye^y?Well, there's a product rule\nthat's one times e^y plus ytimes the derivative of e^y is\nye^y.So, if we do,\nOK, let's put a minus sign infront.\nWell, that's almost what wewant, except we have a minus e^y\ninstead of a plus e^y.So, we need to add 2e^y.\nAnd, I claim that's theantiderivative.\nOK, if you got lost,you can also integrate by\nintegrating by parts,by taking the derivative of y\nand integrating these guys.Or, but, you know, that works.\nJust, your first guess wouldbe, maybe, let's try minus y^e\nto the y.Take the derivative of that,\ncompare, see what you need todo to fix.\nAnd so, if you take thatbetween zero and one,\nyou'll actually get e minustwo.\nOK,so,\ntomorrow we are going to seehow to do double integrals in\npolar coordinates,and also applications of double\nintegrals,how to use them for
