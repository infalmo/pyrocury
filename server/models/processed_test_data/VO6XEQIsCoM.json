[{"text": "I'm going to talk to you about some stuff\nthat's in this book of minethat I hope will resonate with\nother things you've already heard,and I'll try to make\nsome connections myself,in case you miss them.But I want to start with\nwhat I call the \"official dogma.\"The official dogma of what?The official dogma of all Western\nindustrial societies.And the official dogma runs like this:if we are interested in maximizing\nthe welfare of our citizens,the way to do that\nis to maximize individual freedom.The reason for this is both\nthat freedom is, in and of itself, good,valuable, worthwhile,\nessential to being human,and because if people have freedom,then each of us can act on our ownto do the things\nthat will maximize our welfare,and no one has to decide on our behalf.The way to maximize freedom\nis to maximize choice.The more choice people have,\nthe more freedom they have,and the more freedom they have,the more welfare they have.This, I think, is so deeply embedded\nin the water supplythat it wouldn't occur\nto anyone to question it.And it's also deeply\nembedded in our lives.I'll give you some examplesof what modern progress\nhas made possible for us.This is my supermarket.Not such a big one.I want to say just a word\nabout salad dressing.A hundred seventy-five\nsalad dressings in my supermarket,if you don't count\nthe 10 extra-virgin olive oils", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.55}, {"text": "and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buyto make a very large number\nof your own salad dressings,in the off-chance that none of the 175\nthe store has on offer suit you.So this is what the supermarket is like.And then you go\nto the consumer electronics storeto set up a stereo system --speakers, CD player,\ntape player, tuner, amplifier --and in this one single\nconsumer electronics store,there are that many stereo systems.We can construct six and a half million\ndifferent stereo systemsout of the components\nthat are on offer in one store.You've got to admit\nthat's a lot of choice.In other domains --\nthe world of communications.There was a time, when I was a boy,when you could get any kind\nof telephone service you wanted,as long as it came from Ma Bell.You rented your phone, you didn't buy it.One consequence of that, by the way,\nis that the phone never broke.And those days are gone.We now have an almost unlimited\nvariety of phones,especially in the world of cell phones.These are cell phones of the future.My favorite is the middle one --the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer,\nand cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e torch.And if --(Laughter)if by some chance you haven't seen\nthat in your store yet,you can rest assured\nthat one day soon, you will.And what this does is it leads people\nto walk into their stores,asking this question.And do you know what the answer\nto this question now is?The answer is \"no.\"It is not possible to buy a cell phone\nthat doesn't do too much.So, in other aspects of life that are much\nmore significant than buying things,the same explosion of choice is true.Health care.It is no longer the case\nin the United Statesthat you go to the doctor,\nand the doctor tells you what to do.Instead, you go to the doctor,and the doctor tells you,\n\"Well, we could do A, or we could do B.A has these benefits and these risks.B has these benefits and these risks.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.351}, {"text": "What do you want to do?\"And you say, \"Doc, what should I do?\"And the doc says, \"A has\nthese benefits and risks,and B has these benefits and risks.What do you want to do?\"And you say, \"If you were me,\nDoc, what would you do?\"And the doc says, \"But I'm not you.\"And the result is --\nwe call it \"patient autonomy,\"which makes it sound like a good thing,but what it really is is a shifting\nof the burden and the responsibilityfor decision-makingfrom somebody who knows something --\nnamely, the doctor --to somebody who knows nothing\nand is almost certainly sickand thus, not in the best shape\nto be making decisions --namely, the patient.There's enormous marketing\nof prescription drugsto people like you and me,which, if you think about it,\nmakes no sense at all,since we can't buy them.Why do they market to us\nif we can't buy them?The answer is that they expect us\nto call our doctors the next morningand ask for our prescriptions\nto be changed.Something as dramatic as our identityhas now become a matter of choice,as this slide is meant to indicate.We don't inherit an identity;\nwe get to invent it.And we get to reinvent ourselves\nas often as we like.And that means that every day,\nwhen you wake up in the morning,you have to decide\nwhat kind of person you want to be.With respect to marriage and family:there was a time when the default\nassumption that almost everyone hadis that you got married\nas soon as you could,and then you started having kids\nas soon as you could.The only real choice was who,not when, and not what you did after.Nowadays, everything\nis very much up for grabs.I teach wonderfully intelligent students,and I assign 20 percent\nless work than I used to.And it's not because they're less smart,and it's not because\nthey're less diligent.It's because they are preoccupied,\nasking themselves,\"Should I get married or not?\nShould I get married now?Should I get married later?Should I have kids first\nor a career first?\"", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.626}, {"text": "All of these are consuming questions.And they're going to answer\nthese questions,whether or not it means\nnot doing all the work I assignand not getting a good grade\nin my courses.And indeed they should.These are important questions to answer.Work.We are blessed, as Carl was pointing out,with the technology that enables us\nto work every minute of every dayfrom any place on the planet --except the Randolph Hotel.(Laughter)(Applause)There is one corner, by the way,that I'm not going to tell anybody about,\nwhere the WiFi actually works.I'm not telling you about it,\nbecause I want to use it.So what this means,this incredible freedom of choice\nwe have with respect to work,is that we have to make a decision,again and again and again,about whether we should\nor shouldn't be working.We can go to watch our kid play soccer,and we have our cell phone on one hip\nand our Blackberry on our other hip,and our laptop, presumably, on our laps.And even if they're all shut off,every minute that we're watching\nour kid mutilate a soccer game,we are also asking ourselves,\"Should I answer this cell phone call?Should I respond to this email?\nShould I draft this letter?\"And even if the answer\nto the question is \"no,\"it's certainly going to make\nthe experience of your kid's soccer gamevery different than it would've been.So everywhere we look,big things and small things,\nmaterial things and lifestyle things,life is a matter of choice.And the world we used\nto live in looked like this.[Well, actually,\nthey are written in stone.]That is to say, there were some choices,but not everything was a matter of choice.The world we now live in looks like this.[The Ten Commandments Do-It-Yourself Kit]And the question is:\nIs this good news or bad news?And the answer is \"yes.\"(Laughter)We all know what's good about it,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.558}, {"text": "so I'm going to talk\nabout what's bad about it.All of this choice has two effects,two negative effects on people.One effect, paradoxically,is that it produces paralysis\nrather than liberation.With so many options to choose from,people find it very difficult\nto choose at all.I'll give you one very dramatic\nexample of this,a study that was done of investments\nin voluntary retirement plans.A colleague of mine got access\nto investment records from Vanguard,the gigantic mutual fund company,of about a million employees\nand about 2,000 different workplaces.What she found is that for every\n10 mutual funds the employer offered,rate of participation\nwent down two percent.You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent\nfewer employees participatethan if you only offer five.Why?Because with 50 funds to choose from,it's so damn hard to decide\nwhich fund to choose,that you'll just put it off till tomorrow,and then tomorrowand then tomorrow and tomorrow,and, of course, tomorrow never comes.Understand that not only does this meanthat people are going to have\nto eat dog food when they retirebecause they don't have\nenough money put away,it also means that making\nthe decision is so hardthat they pass up significant\nmatching money from the employer.By not participating, they are passing up\nas much as 5,000 dollars a yearfrom the employer,who would happily\nmatch their contribution.So paralysis is a consequence\nof having too many choices.And I think it makes\nthe world look like this.[And lastly, for all eternity,\nFrench, bleu cheese or ranch?](Laughter)You really want to get the decision right\nif it's for all eternity, right?You don't want to pick the wrong\nmutual fund or wrong salad dressing.So that's one effect.The second effect is that, even if\nwe manage to overcome the paralysis", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.532}, {"text": "and make a choice,we end up less satisfied\nwith the result of the choicethan we would be if we had\nfewer options to choose from.And there are several reasons for this.One of them is, with a lot of different\nsalad dressings to choose from,if you buy one and it's not perfect --\nand what salad dressing is? --it's easy to imagine\nthat you could've made a different choicethat would've been better.And what happens is,this imagined alternative induces you\nto regret the decision you made,and this regret subtracts\nfrom the satisfaction you getout of the decision you made,even if it was a good decision.The more options there are,\nthe easier it is to regret anything at allthat is disappointing\nabout the option that you chose.Second, what economists\ncall \"opportunity costs.\"Dan Gilbert made a big point this morningof talking about how much the way\nin which we value thingsdepends on what we compare them to.Well, when there are lots\nof alternatives to consider,it's easy to imagine the attractive\nfeatures of alternatives that you rejectthat make you less satisfied\nwith the alternative that you've chosen.Here's an example.[I can't stop thinking about those other\navailable parking spaces on W 85th Street]If you're not a New Yorker, I apologize.Here's what you're supposed\nto be thinking.Here's this couple on the Hamptons.\nVery expensive real estate.Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day.\nThey have it all to themselves.What could be better?\"Damn it,\" this guy is thinking,\"It's August. Everybody\nin my Manhattan neighborhood is away.I could be parking\nright in front of my building.\"And he spends two weeks nagged by the ideathat he is missing\nthe opportunity, day after day,to have a great parking space.(Laughter)Opportunity costs\nsubtract from the satisfactionthat we get out of what we choose,even when what we choose is terrific.And the more options\nthere are to consider,the more attractive features\nof these optionsare going to be reflected by us\nas opportunity costs.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.445}, {"text": "Here's another example.(Laughter)Now, this cartoon makes a lot of points.It makes points about\nliving in the moment as well,and probably about doing things slowly.But one point it makes is that whenever\nyou're choosing one thing,you're choosing not to do other things,and those other things may have\nlots of attractive features,and it's going to make what you're doingless attractive.Third: escalation of expectations.This hit me when I went\nto replace my jeans.I wear jeans almost all the time.There was a time\nwhen jeans came in one flavor,and you bought them,\nand they fit like crap.They were incredibly uncomfortable,and if you wore them long enough\nand washed them enough times,they started to feel OK.I went to replace my jeans\nafter years of wearing these old ones.I said, \"I want a pair of jeans.\nHere's my size.\"And the shopkeeper said,\"Do you want slim fit,\neasy fit, relaxed fit?You want button fly or zipper fly?\nYou want stonewashed or acid-washed?Do you want them distressed?Do you want boot cut, tapered?\"\nBlah, blah, blah on and on he went.My jaw dropped.And after I recovered, I said,\"I want the kind that used to be\nthe only kind.\"(Laughter)He had no idea what that was.(Laughter)So I spent an hour trying on\nall these damn jeans,and I walked out of the store -- truth --with the best-fitting jeans\nI had ever had.I did better.All this choice made it possible\nfor me to do better.But --I felt worse.Why? I wrote a whole book\nto try to explain this to myself.The reason is --(Laughter)The reason I felt worse is that\nwith all of these options available,my expectations about how good\na pair of jeans should be went up.I had very low, no particular expectations\nwhen they only came in one flavor.When they came in 100 flavors, damn it,\none of them should've been perfect.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.38}, {"text": "And what I got was good,\nbut it wasn't perfect.And so I compared what I got\nto what I expected,and what I got was disappointing\nin comparison to what I expected.Adding options to people's livescan't help but increase\nthe expectations people haveabout how good those options will be.And what that's going to produce\nis less satisfaction with results,even when they're good results.[It all looks so great.\nI can't wait to be disappointed.]Nobody in the world\nof marketing knows this.Because if they did, you wouldn't all know\nwhat this was about.The truth is more like this.[Everything was better back\nwhen everything was worse.]The reason that everything was better\nback when everything was worseis that when everything was worse,it was actually possible for peopleto have experiences\nthat were a pleasant surprise.Nowadays, the world we live in --\nwe affluent, industrialized citizens,with perfection the expectation --the best you can ever hope foris that stuff is as good\nas you expect it to be.You will never be pleasantly surprised,because your expectations,\nmy expectations,have gone through the roof.The secret to happiness --\nthis is what you all came for --the secret to happiness is:low expectations.(Laughter)[You'll do](Applause)(Laughter)I want to say --just a little autobiographical moment --that I actually am married to a wife,and she's really quite wonderful.I couldn't have done better.I didn't settle.But settling isn't always\nsuch a bad thing.Finally,one consequence of buying\na bad-fitting pair of jeanswhen there is only one kind to buyis that when you are dissatisfied\nand you ask why, who's responsible,the answer is clear:\nthe world is responsible.What could you do?When there are hundreds\nof different styles of jeans availableand you buy one that is disappointingand you ask why, who's responsible,", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.33}, {"text": "it is equally clear that the answer\nto the question is \"you.\"You could have done better.With a hundred different kinds\nof jeans on display,there is no excuse for failure.And so when people make decisions,and even though the results\nof the decisions are good,they feel disappointed about them;they blame themselves.Clinical depression has exploded\nin the industrial worldin the last generation.I believe a significant -- not the only,\nbut a significant -- contributorto this explosion of depression\nand also suicide,is that people have experiences\nthat are disappointingbecause their standards are so high,and then when they have to explain\nthese experiences to themselves,they think they're at fault.So the net result is that we do\nbetter in general, objectively,and we feel worse.So let me remind you:this is the official dogma,\nthe one that we all take to be true,and it's all false.It is not true.There's no question that some choice\nis better than none.But it doesn't follow from thatthat more choice\nis better than some choice.There's some magical amount.\nI don't know what it is.I'm pretty confident that we have\nlong since passed the pointwhere options improve our welfare.Now, as a policy matter --\nI'm almost done --as a policy matter,\nthe thing to think about is this:what enables all of this choice\nin industrial societiesis material affluence.There are lots of places in the world,and we have heard about several of them,where their problem is not\nthat they have too much choice.Their problem is they have too little.So the stuff I'm talking about\nis the peculiar problemof modern, affluent, Western societies.And what is so frustrating\nand infuriating is this:Steve Levitt talked to you yesterdayabout how these expensive\nand difficult-to-install child seats", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.267}, {"text": "don't help.It's a waste of money.What I'm telling you is that\nthese expensive, complicated choices --it's not simply that they don't help.They actually hurt.They actually make us worse off.If some of what enables\npeople in our societiesto make all of the choices we makewere shifted to societies\nin which people have too few options,not only would those\npeople's lives be improved,but ours would be improved also.This is what economists call\na \"Pareto-improving move.\"Income redistribution will make\neveryone better off,not just poor people,because of how all this excess\nchoice plagues us.So to conclude.[You can be anything\nyou want to be -- no limits.]You're supposed to read this cartoon\nand, being a sophisticated person, say,\"Ah! What does this fish know?\nNothing is possible in this fishbowl.\"Impoverished imagination,\na myopic view of the world --that's the way I read it at first.The more I thought about it, however,the more I came to the view\nthat this fish knows something.Because the truth of the matter is,if you shatter the fishbowl\nso that everything is possible,you don't have freedom.You have paralysis.If you shatter this fishbowl\nso that everything is possible,you decrease satisfaction.You increase paralysis,\nand you decrease satisfaction.Everybody needs a fishbowl.This one is almost\ncertainly too limited --perhaps even for the fish,\ncertainly for us.But the absence of some metaphorical\nfishbowl is a recipe for miseryand, I suspect, disaster.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.242}]
