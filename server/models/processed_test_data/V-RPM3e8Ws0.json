explainwhy this is the correct answer?And we have a\nsyringe highlighter.You probably never had\nsomething like this before.AUDIENCE: OK, so the fourth\nexcited state is n equals 5.And then IE is opposite of\nthe negative number shown.So it would be a\npositive reaction.PROFESSOR: Right.So IE is always\ngoing to be positive.And you have to pay attention\nto what n equals whenyou're in the excited state.So we've been talking about\nthe hydrogen atom and bindingenergies.What comes out of the\nSchrodinger equation?We have the binding\nenergies that come out.And we also have wave functions.So today we're\ngoing to be talkingabout wave functions,\nwhich are oftenreferred to as\norbitals in chemistry,for the hydrogen atom.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So when you solve the\nSchrodinger equation,you get out this information\nabout wave functions.And what comes out of it\nis these quantum numbers.And we already saw quantum\nnumber n coming out.But there are three\nquantum numbersthat are going to come out\nof the Schrodinger equation.And those three\nquantum numbers arenecessary to describe the\nwave function or the orbital.So we have n, the\nprinciple quantum number.We've already talked about that.And we've already seen\nthat n is an integer.So I'll just put that down here.So n can equal 1, 2,\n3, on to infinity.So this describes the\nenergy level or the shell.Then we have l, which we\nhaven't talked about yet.So that's the angular\nmomentum quantum number.So it tells you about\nthe angular momentum.It also tells you\nabout the subshellor the shape of the orbital.And so l is related to n.And it can be 0, 1, 2,\n3, onward to n minus 1.So its biggest\nnumber is n minus 1.Then we have m, the\nmagnetic quantum number.And we often see this\nalso listed as m subl because m is\nrelated back to l.And this is equal to minus\nl, dot, dot, dot, to 0,dot, dot, dot to plus l.And m describes the behavior\nin a magnetic field.It also describes\nthe orientation", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.468}, {"text": "of the orbital with\nrespect to an axes.And it tells you about the\nspecific orbital in question.So we need all three of these\nto describe any orbital.All right, so let's look at\nthis in a slightly other way.So we're going to have lots of\ndifferent sort of nomenclaturesfor the same thing.So to describe an orbital,\nwe need those three quantumnumbers.We need n, l, and m.And this can also be expressed\nas our wave function sub nlm.And again, we talked\nabout this last time.We're going to\ntalk more about it.So our wave function\nis also describedby r, the radius, and theta\nand phi, which are two angles.And we're going to talk\na lot about those today.So the wave function\nfor the ground stateis abbreviated wave\nfunction sub 1, 0, 0.Because it's the ground state.So n equals 1,\nand l and m are 0.So what you see down\nhere, the 1, 0, 0,refers back to what is\nn, what is l, what is m.And this also has another name.So in the terminology\nof chemists,we call the wave function 1,\n0, 0 1s, or the 1s orbital.So let's look again\nnow at the same thingswe just talked about,\nbut going through kindof chemistry lingo.So again, n describes the\nshell or the energy level.Again, it's integers,\n1, 2, 3, et cetera.l in chemistry lingo,\nthe subshell or the shapeof the orbital.And instead of\nlisting it this way,", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.455}, {"text": "we have another way to\nlist it if we're a chemist,and that is s, p,\nd, f, et cetera.So chemists like numbers, but\nwe also throw in some lettersevery once in a while.And then m, again, designates\nthis orbital orientationor the specific orbital.So for s, there's only s.It doesn't have any\nother designation,as we'll talk more about later.But for p, we start\nhaving suborbitals.And there is a\ndifference in termsof the orientation of this.So we have px, py, pz.So that's what m tells us about.So if we have all\nthree of these numbers,we get down to the\nspecific orbital,we can say oh, that's\npz, for example.So we need all of these three\nnumbers to define the orbital.And this is in then\nthe chemistry lingo.All right, also a little\nbit more chemistry lingo.So here we have l equals 0.So that is the s orbital.When l equals 1,\nthat's the p orbital.l equals 2 is the d orbital.And l equals 3 is the f orbital.And frankly we don't\nreally go much beyond that.And in this part of\nthe course, we'rereally only going to be talking\nmostly about s and p orbitals.We get to d orbitals\naround Thanksgiving time.So you can look forward to that.And pretty much we're not going\nto really talk about f orbitalsvery much at all.You'll need to know\nsome things about them,but we're not going to go into\nthem in any kind of detail.All right, so if\nwe keep going then,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.339}, {"text": "we can think about l\nequals 1 or our p orbitals.And then when l equals 1, then\nm can equal 0

this is just something\nthat you need to remember,that z is the one\nthat's special.It's the one that\nhas m equals 0.All right, so we can take\nall of the nomenclaturesnow and use it to fill\nin this awesome table.So this will help\nyou kind of keeptrack of all the\ndifferent ways youcan designate the same things.And we'll fill this in.So first, state label.What do I mean by this?By this I mean this one 1, 0, 0\nto generate this wave functionwhere we have this 1, 0, 0\nlisted below the wave functionhere.And so now this is just\na little color coding.But it's blank in your handout.So n equals 1, so n is first.l is the second number.And m is the third here.So 1, 0, 0, and what\nkind of orbital is this?You can just yell it out.AUDIENCE: 1sPROFESSOR: Yep, so\nthat's the 1s orbital.And so the 1, n\nequals 1, that's 1s.And now we have our\nbinding energies again.And so we can write those\nin two different ways.So we saw for the\nhydrogen atom before whatcomes out of the\nSchrodinger equation,that the binding energy of\nthe electron for the nucleusis minus the Rydberg constant\nRH, divided by n squared.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.439}, {"text": "And here n is 1, so\ndivided by 1

going to write here\nfor the state label?You can just yell it out.Yep, 200 or 2, 0, 0.And then you would\nput it this waywhere the state label\nis by the wave function.What orbital is this-- 2s.And then we also know the\nbinding energies for this.So here we have minus\nRH over n squaredwhere n is 2, 2 squared.And we saw this\nnumber last time.So we can keep going.Now we have 2, 1, 1.So we can write that down.We can write it both ways.What orbital is this?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: So it's a 2p.And because n is plus 1 and\nnot 0, it's either x or y.Do we have a different or\nthe same binding energy here?We have the same, right, because\nit's just over n squared.We're still talking about\nn equals 2, so 2 squared.So it's the same value here.Now we have m equals 0.So we write 2, 1, 0.And now what is that orbital?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: 2pz, right,\nbecause that's mequals 0, by the\ndefinition I gave you.So we know that one for sure.And again, the energies\nare going to be the same.And then the last one, so\nnow we write 2, 1, minus 1.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.346}, {"text": "And now it's again a 2p orbital.And it's either y or x.And the energies are\ngoing to be

think\nabout the binding energiesfor those particular\norbitals, or for electronsin those particular orbitals.All right, so why don't you\ntry a clicker question on this?10 seconds.Ah, excellent.Right.So you're getting\nthe hang of this.It's great.Some things, it's\nalways nice whenthere's some things that\nare pretty straightforward.So n equals 5.l equals 1, which means\np orbital and m equals 0,means pz.So let's think now about\nthese orbitals again.And we looked at\nthat table and sawthat if we were talking\nabout n equals 2,they all seem to\nhave the same energy.So for a hydrogen atom-- and\nit will get more complicated", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.46}, {"text": "when we start\ntalking about thingswith more than one electron.But for a hydrogen atom,\norbitals that have the same nvalue have the same energy.So here we have n\nequals 1, l equals 0.This is our 1s.We have n equals 2, our\n2s, and our 2p orbitals.n equals 3, we have\nour 3s, 3p, and 3d.And in this case,\nall these orbitalsare what's known as degenerate\nwith respect to each other.They have the same energy.And so for any n with a hydrogen\natom, or any one electronsystem, for n shells,\nthere n square degenerate--or for any n there are n\nsquared generate orbitals.So they're all going\nto be the same energy.And that changes when we go\nto more complicated systems.But for hydrogen, this holds.So now I'm going\nto tell you why youshould care a little about\nthese energy levels again.And today you're going to\nhear in their own wordsfrom a graduate student in the\nphysical chemistry division.[VIDEO PLAYBACK]- My name is\nBenjamin Ofori-Okai.I'm entering my third\nyear of graduate schoolin the chemistry\ndepartment here at MIT.And the work that\nI've been focusingon for the last couple\nof years involvesnanoscale magnetic resonance\nimaging or nano MRI.When you think of\ntypical MRI, whatcomes to mind for most people\nis the image of a brainscan or a heart scan\nor some sort of organscan inside the human body.The way that MRI works\nnow, the way that youtake a picture of anything in\nyour body is you use water.And the reason\nthat you use wateris because it's made up of\nhydrogen atoms and oxygenatoms.And hydrogen atoms actually\ngenerate a magnetic signal.And so you can take\na picture of that.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.313}, {"text": "The idea behind nano MRI is\nthat you want to take a picture.You want to do the\nsame kind of imaging,but on a considerably\nsmaller scale.We have this probe\nwhich is sensitiveto local magnetic fields.And the way that\nthe probe works isthat you have these electrons.There's a ground state\nfor these electronsand two excited states for these\nelectrons, which are actuallydegenerate with each other.And degenerate means that they\njust have the exact same energylevel.As you move the probe\naround, anythingthat's in the environment that\ngenerates a magnetic fieldwill change what\nthe energy levelsof these two excited states is.So when you're far\naway, there's no changeand they're exactly the same.And as you get\ncloser and closer,these levels start to split.And what we actually\ncare about iswhat is the splitting\nbetween these two levels,because that's what tells us\nwhat the magnetic field is.In traditional MRI,\nthe probe that weuse, the thing that\nmeasures the fields,itself is very, very big.It's person sized.The probe that we're\nusing in this nano MRIis nanometer sized.So this gives us the ability\nto look at things thatare on the nanometer scale.And to give you a sense of size,\nthat's like 1/10,000 the widthof a human hair.So that includes viruses,\ncells, parts of proteins,not just the entire protein.And on top of that, we'll be\nable to look within objects.So you're not just sensitive\nto what's on the surface.You can actually\nsee how are things--what's the constitution?What's the makeup of things\nwithin the object that youwant to image?So the long term\ngoal, the one thingthat I'd really love to see\nthis technology be able to dois say, OK, we've\ngot this virus.Let's just see how it works.Let's watch it in real time.Let's see if we can see\nhow it attaches to cellsand invades them and\nultimately kills them.[END PLAYBACK]PROFESSOR: OK, so I always think\nthis is a great time of yearto show this video because\npretty much viruses, I think,start to be on people's minds.Everyone has sinuses and colds\nand other things going on.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.262}, {"text": "And so understanding,\nwe're still very far awayfrom having a real cure\nfor the common cold.So I think it's very\ntimely to be talking about,talking about this research.I'll also use this to\nremind myself to tell youthat if you qualify for\nextra time on the exam,you should get me your\nform for the exam.And it reminded me to\nsay that because Ben,who is a former\nTA for this class,always proctors the\nextra time folks.So you'll get to\nmeet him in real lifeif you qualify for\nextra time on exams.So hydrogen is in\nfact important.I'm excited to get\non to elements thathave more than one electron.But hydrogen actually does turn\nout to be extremely important.A lot of imaging, as you heard\nfrom Ben, is based on hydrogen.So we're spending a lot\nof time on hydrogen,but hydrogen really, really\nis an important element.So continuing on now,\nwhat is the significanceof this wave function?Why do we care about this?And so really, we're\ninterested in tryingto understand not just how\ntightly the electron isbound to the nucleus, but kind\nof how the electrons existaround the nucleus.And so the wave function\nreally gets at this.It gets at the probability\ndensity, the likelihoodthat you'll find an electron\nat a certain location,the probability per unit volume.And again, this is a\nthree dimensional problem.So our wave function\ndepends on a radius r.But it also depends on two\nangles, the theta and phi.And so you can kind of think of\nthose as latitude and longitudeif you will.And so we want to know\nwhat the probability is", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.34}, {"text": "that an electron will be at\na certain r, theta, and phiposition in a particular small\nunit volume in that area.How well can we understand\nwhere the electron is?And this gives rise to a lot of\nthe properties of the elements.So probability density,\ndensity per unit volume.So really, when we're talking\nabout where electrons are,we're thinking about\na shape of an orbital,a shape of a probability density\nof where that electron mightbe.So now we're going to\nthink about shapes.So we can define a\nwave function in termsof two properties, a radial wave\nfunction and an angular wavefunction.So again, the wave function\nhas these three things.We are considered with a\nradius and these two angles.So we can rewrite\nthis, breaking upthese two different components--\nthe radial component thatdepends on the radius-- so\nthat's easy to remember,radial, radius-- and\nthe angular componentthat depends on the angles.So the nomenclature\nhere is pretty good.All right, so we have\nthese two components.So now I'm going to\nshow you a table thatis largely from your book.Don't let it scare you.You do not need to memorize\nany of these things.And I'm showing this\nto you because Iwant you to believe me about\ncertain properties of these twofunctions.So here they are solved.You can look them up.Actually I think we just\ntyped a new copy of thisso it was easier to see.If you find any typos,\nplease let me know.But there's a couple\nof important points.So on this side, we have\nthe radial wave function,and over here we have the\nangular wave function,for various values of n and l.So again, not an\nexhaustive list here.And a lot of these are\nwritten in terms of a0,", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.378}, {"text": "which is the Bohr radius, which\nis a constant, 52.9 picometers.All right, so now let's just\nconsider the ground state.So we'll start with\nthat lowest energystate or most stable state,\nthe 1s orbital for the hydrogenatom.So we have our wave\nfunction 1, 0, 0 here.And this is 1s up here.Again, n equals 1. l equals 0.So that's 1s.And z for hydrogen atom is 1.So I've gotten rid of all z's\nto make it a little simpler.So here we have the\nradial wave functiontimes the angular wave function,\nwhich is listed up here.And the thing that I\nreally want you to noticeis that for all of the s\norbitals, this is a constant.So this is always the angular\ncomponent for all s orbitals.And in fact, there are no\nangular components in there.So all 1s, 2s, 3s, all\nhave this same constant.And that leads to a\nvery important propertyof s orbitals, which\nis that they'respherically symmetrical.In other words, they're\nindependent of those angles,of theta and phi.And so that means that\nthe probability of findingthe electron away\nfrom the nucleusis just going to depend on r.There's only r in this equation.The angles are not\npart of the equation.So s is spherically symmetrical.The probability of\nfinding the electronjust depends on the radius.So we can draw a picture,\nor multiple pictures,of what that could look like.And these are\nthree common plots.So I'll tell you\nthat on your handout,the plots are\nlisted on one page,and then the plots are\nshown on the next page.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.206}, {"text": "And I'm going to kind of go\nback and forth between things.So the plots-- don't\nhave to write this down.They're on the other page.But if you want to pay\nattention to which kind of plotgoes with which plot.So these are three different\nways to, quote, visualize.And some people say, can you\ngive me another visualization?We're really just trying to\nthink about probabilitiesof finding electrons here.And so you can't sort of\ntake a picture of an orbital.So these are just\ndifferent ways to helppeople think about that possible\ndistribution of electronsaround the nucleus.All right, so one thing that\neveryone's feeling pretty goodabout is that it should\nbe spherically symmetrichole for an s orbital.And so we have a circle.And so the probability\ndensity, whichis shown in this plot-- and\nthe probability density partsare basically just dots\nwhere the more concentratedthe dots are, the\nhigher the probabilitydensity for that\nparticular-- the probabilityfor that particular\nvolume exists.So in here there are sort of\nmore dots and then less dotsas you come out.And so that is a\ncircle, which is what?It's symmetrical.So you can always\nrecognize a 1s.You have this symmetrical thing.So this is the wave function\nsquared, is this probabilitydensity plot.Another kind of plot\nthat you can seelooks at the radial\nwave functionplotted against the\ndistance r here,distance from the nucleus.And then a third kind of plot\nis another probability plot,like this one up here.But instead of the dots\nindicating the higherprobability density, you\nhave a radial probabilitydistribution.And so at the nucleus,\nat 0, well then", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.146}, {"text": "the probability goes up.The electron is not going\nto crash into the nucleus,so it won't be right\non top of the nucleus.But as you get out a\nlittle bit farther away,there's a high probability\nthat it's there.And then that decreases again.So the top one\nand the bottom oneboth talk about the probability\nof finding an electronin a particular unit.And I'll give you just a\nlittle more definition of this.And this is on the same page\nabove those different plots.So the radial\nprobability distributionreports on the\nprobability of findingan electron in the\nspherical shellat some little distance\ndr from the origin.And one thing that\ncomes out of this,which is pretty important,\nis the most probable valuefor that distance\nr, which is denotedrmp, so most probable distance.And for a hydrogen atom,\nthis is a0, the Bohr radius.And you can see it expressed\nin different units over here.And from the plot, that will\nbe the top part of the plot,the most probable distance.In this case, that's the Bohr\nradius for the hydrogen atom.So we have now these\nthree different kindsof plots that you'll see.And I want to point out that\nthey're different plots.Sometimes people are thinking\nthat there is sort of one plotand they're trying to read one\nof them as probability density,and that's not what it is.So we'll look at these again.All right, so going\nback and we'll justlook at them again now that\nwe sort of talked about whatall of them are,\nagain, we have our sortof dot density, probability\ndensity plot, our wave functionplot, and our radial\nprobability distribution plot.And for 1s, we have the dots\ncloser to the nucleus here.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.228}, {"text": "Probability goes\nup and goes down.And here, you're\nthinking about thisas the amplitude of finding\nan electron as you move awayfrom the nucleus.So 1s is pretty simple.And I think these plots are a\nlot more meaningful when we goon to look at other orbitals.So let's think about\nthose other orbitals.And we'll finish\nthe other plots.So this is just-- you can\nactually stay, in this case.So we're going a lot of\nback and forth today.So here is your table\nthat we had before.And here's 1s.Here's 2s.Here's 3s.These terms are in fact\ndifferent, as you can see.But the angular term,\nas we mentioned before,is still the same.So that means 2s and 3s\nare still symmetrical.So we're still thinking\nabout the probabilityof finding an electron\nin some volumeas just going out\nas a distance of r.So let's look now at the three\nplots, and compare those plots.And this is the one on\nyour handouts we looked at.I showed you this.And now we have all of these\nthree plots together here.And in the comparison\nof these three,I think it helps\ndifferentiate whatyou're seeing in these plots.So important point,\nthey're spherical.1s, 2s, 3s, they're\nall spherical.And here we see the\ndot density increase.And then the dot\ndensity goes to 0.And that's known as a node.So a node is a value\nof r or theta or phifor which the wave\nfunction and wave functionsquared, or the\nprobability density, is 0.And in this particular case, the\ntype of node that we're seeingis a radial node.And so that's a value of r\nfor which the wave function,", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.163}, {"text": "wave function squared\nprobability density is 0.So it goes to 0.We have a node, a radial node.Then there's more probability.And then it increases, and\nthen starts decreasing again.And so if you plot this with the\nradial wave function versus r,you see it go down.And it crosses the\nzero line here.And that's the node.And that's at 2a0.And then it goes back up.And this plot often\nbothers people.They're saying, what, there's\nnow negative probability?No, these are not the\nprobability diagrams.This is thinking\nabout the amplitudeof finding an electron.So we don't have to worry.It can have a positive or\na negative phase to it.And if you look at this\nplot, the radial probabilitydistribution plot,\nthen you'll seethat actually the radius,\nthe most probable radiusis in this region over here.And you see that this is\nconcentrated dots up here.So if we think about these two,\nwhich are really probabilitydistribution diagrams, we're\nthinking about the probabilityof finding an electron.You have a probability in\nhere close to the nucleus.Then you get a node.And then you have another\nprobability, high probabilityof finding the electron.In fact that's the most\nprobable radius here for 2s.And then it decreases.So this line shows\nyou what a radial nodelooks like in all three plots.In this probability\ndiagram, wave functionsquared plot, it looks like\nthere's just an empty space,no dots at all.Down here, it's where\nit crosses the line.And in the bottom plot, it\nis where you go up and down", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and again touches the\nline before going back up.So you should be able\nto look at these plotsand think about what they mean.For 3s, we see the same thing.But now we have an intense spot\nin the middle near the nucleus.That is indicated down here.There is probability of finding\nthe electron near the nucleus.Then there's a node.And that's in this plot\nwhere it crosses the lineand in this plot where\nyou have the empty space.Then you have more probability\nof finding the electron.You have another bump here.And then we have another node,\nindicated by touching the zeroline here, touching here.That's at 7.1a0.And then we have\nmore probabilityof finding the electron.And this is where the most\nprobable radius is at 11.5.So again, you need to be able\nto look at these diagramsand recognize what\nconstitutes a radial node.And a node is a\nplace where thereis no probability that you're\ngoing to find an electron.So now let's think about\nhow many nodes, or radialnodes you should\nhave when you havedifferent types of orbitals.And this is just a similar\ndiagram to what I just showed.This is the wave function\nsquared, probability diagram.And now instead of blue\nyou have orange dots,but otherwise should be the\nsame-- so for 1s, for 2s,and 3s.So for the 1s orbital,\nwe can calculatehow many radial\nnodes that we shouldhave by using this handy\nformula, n minus 1 minus l.So for 1s we have 1 minus 1.", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.174}, {"text": "And l is 0.So we have zero radial nodes.And

space.And that radial node is at 2a0.For 3s, we have n equals 3 minus\n1 minus l, which is still 0.So we have two radial nodes.And so again, the empty\nspace here at 1.9a0 and thenat 7.1a0.So why don't you\ngive this a try nowand tell me what kind of radial\nnodes you would expect for 4p.OK, 10 seconds.These are pretty fast.Yep.So again, we have to do\nn, which is 4, minus 1.And then what is l\nin this case-- 1.So that gives you 2.All right, so 4 minus 1\nminus 1 or 2 radial nodes.All right, don't put\nyour clickers away.", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Let's try something

it up\nin terms of the plots.So maybe someone want to say\nwhat the right answer is here?Yeah?AUDIENCE: So by the\nformula we just did,that has four radial nodes.And if you look at the\ngraph of one,

we count 1, 2, 3, 4.Sorry, the new plot\nis highly confusing.I have to count.So the one at the origin\nshould actually not count.AUDIENCE: It doesn't count?PROFESSOR: This is not a node.So we have 1,

much,\nand [INAUDIBLE], here.You were brave enough to answer.Yeah, there's a question?AUDIENCE: Should there also\nbe a certain number of peaksin the graph as well as nodes?PROFESSOR: Yeah.So if you look at the peaks,\nthese are really hard to draw.And I think that's partly\nwhat the problem is.But when we look\nlater in the handoutwhere they're drawn a\nlittle bit more carefully,it does increase.So there are different numbers.So we'll have nodes\ngoing down here.But then we'll have\nmore distributions.But often the ones\nas you go along,it does indicate where the\nmost probable radius is", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.174}, {"text": "as the taller ones, and that\nit's usually drawn at the end.So we have some plots and\nI'll point this out later.We're going to look at\nmore plots, don't worry.So if anyone's good\nat drawing those,let me know, because\nthey're really hard to draw.So a lot of them are\ncopied from the book,but then they don't\ncopy very well.So let's consider\nother kinds of nodes.And we're going to come\nback to radial nodes.All right, so what\nabout p orbitals?So here we have our table again.These are our p\norbitals over here.And we have our n equals 2\ncases here and our l equals 1.So these are x, y, and z--\nso our 3p orbitals over here.And the important point\nis not to memorizewhat these values are.But now all of a sudden we\nhave dependence on angles.So we're going to have an\nangular component to these.And that means the\nprobability densityas you go out from the\nnucleus doesn't justdepend on r anymore.It depends on theta\nand phi, whichare sort of the equivalent\nto latitude and longitude,if you're thinking\nabout geography.All right, so let's see\nwhat that looks like.So that means then\nthe p orbitalsare not spherically symmetric,\nbecause it depends on angle.So you just don't go out and\nhave the probability dependon the radius and\nit's symmetricalin all the different directions.And here are what some\nof them look like.These figures are\nin your handouts.Here are some other figures.So the orbitals\nconsists of two lobes.", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.39}, {"text": "So you could view this as a lobe\nup here and a lobe down here.Or you have these lobes as these\ntwo different colors over here.And the lobes are\nseparated by a nodal plane.And the nodal plane is a\nplane on which the probabilityof finding the electrons is 0.So in the top drawing, the\nnodal plane is drawn as a plane.And in the bottom drawings,\nyou don't see a plane.You just see an empty\nspace between the lobes.So empty space here, empty\nspace here, empty space there.And so if it helps\nyou to kind of thinkabout an actual plane\nin between, that's good.Or you can just\nthink that there'sa break between these nodes.And again, the\nnodal plane, there'sno probability of finding an\nelectron in the nodal planes.And the nodal planes\nare at the nucleus.Therefore, there\nis zero probabilityof finding a p electron\nat the nucleus.s can get pretty\nclose to the nucleus.But with a p orbital,\nthere's a nodal plane there.No electrons are going\nto be at the nucleus.So now if you're going out from\nthe nucleus, the probabilityof an electron,\nfinding it, if you'regoing out in this\ndirection, you'renot going to do very well.If you're going\nin this direction,you should do a lot better.So here the angular\ncomponents really matter.That defines the\nshape of the orbital.And where you're going,\nwhat direction you'regoing in, what\nangles you're goingin matters in terms of\nwhether you're goingto find that electron or not.So another way to\nthink about thisin sort of these nodal\nplanes-- so here we'lljust define what plane it is.So we have our pz orbital.That's a nodal plane\nthen in x and y.And so x and y are over here.", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.184}, {"text": "Our px orbital is\ngoing to be in--or the nodal plane is going to\nbe in yz plane, so over here.And py will be in xz plane.So again, these\nnodal planes, there'sno electron density there.And these arise from\nthese angular nodesin the wave function.So angular nodes\nthen or these angularnodal planes are\nvalues of theta and phifor which the wave function,\nwave function squared are 0.So this is very\ndifferent from the s casewhere we only had radial nodes.But now, when in\nthe p orbitals wherethe angular component matters,\nthey're angular nodes as well.So we can think about how to\ncalculate the angular nodes.So total nodes is going\nto be equal to n minus 1.The angular nodes is l.And as we saw before, the radial\nnodes are n minus 1 minus l.So let's have more practice\nin calculating these.And then we'll look\nat some more diagrams.So for 2s, total nodes-- and\nyou can just yell this out.Total nodes will be what?AUDIENCE: 1PROFESSOR: 1-- 2 minus 1 or 1.Angular nodes are?AUDIENCE: 0PROFESSOR: 0.For 1s, there is none.And if you forget,\nl equals 0 there.Radial nodes is going to be?AUDIENCE: 1PROFESSOR: Right, 2\nminus 1 minus 0, or 1.All right, let's try 3--\nor sorry, 2p is next.Total nodes?", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.441}, {"text": "1 again, so 2 minus 1 or 1.Angular nodes?1-- l equals 1 here.And radial node?Right, 2 minus 1 minus 1, or 0.So since there's\nonly one total node,if you figured out there\nwas one angular node,you could even realize that\nthere had to be zero there.It's a way to check\nmaybe your equations.All right, so let's\ntry for 3d now.How are we doing?All right, let's just\ndo 10 more seconds.And let's just work\nthat out over here.So total nodes for 3d,\nwe have 3 minus 1 or 2.Angular nodes, l equals 2 for d.So radial nodes, we have\n3 minus 1 minus 2, or 0.", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.516}, {"text": "All right, so bring these\nhandouts on Wednesdaybecause we need to go back and\nlook at more radial probabilitydiagrams.And talk more about nodes.All right, let's just\ndo 10 more seconds.OK, good job everyone.Let's look through\nthis a little bit.And you can sort of--\neveryone can help.Yell out some responses.So this was 2s.And that was the correct answer.Which type of\norbital is this-- 2p.And if you couldn't read\nthis information here,you should have been able\nto read the informationabout the nodes.What equation is that for nodes?Yeah, n minus 1 minus l,\nfor what kind of nodes?AUDIENCE: Radial.PROFESSOR: Radial nodes, right.So if you know what it means if\nl equals 0 versus l equals 1,and you knew this\nwas l, then youcould tell if it was an\ns orbital or a p orbital.And then whether it was\n2 or 3p is from the n.So even if you\ncouldn't read this,if you knew that expression,\nthen you were OK.What kind of orbital\nwas in plot C?", "start": 2880.0, "heat": 0.802}, {"text": "This was a 3s.l equals 0.And then this is a what, 3p and?l equals 2.Louder.D, right?So do 3px, 3py, and 3pz\nhave different plots?No, they wouldn't\nhave different plots.So we'll continue\nto look at this.And we're going to be\nstarting with the handoutfrom last time.And so let's\ncontinue with Mondayand continue with these radial\nprobability distributions.So this is again\nfrom Monday, page 6.We're talking\nabout orbital size.And we've already looked\nat this a little bit today.So we should be able\nto go through this nowin a little bit more detail.You've already thought about it.So here we have the 2s orbital.And we're going to\nhave one node usingour equation that you just\ntold me, n minus 1 minus l.And when we go from 2s to 2p,\nhere we have no radial nodes.And we can look\nat r and p, whichis the radius of the maximal\nprobability of findingan electron.And you can note that when\nyou go from the 2s to the 2p,the radius actually decreases.So the most probable radius\nfor 2p is less than that of 2s.Now let's consider\nthe 3, n equals 3.So we have the 3s\nsituation over here.And so l equals 0.We have two nodes here.And now if you look at the\nradius, the axis over here,", "start": 3000.0, "heat": 0.425}, {"text": "you'll see that the\nmost probable for 2sis close to 5a0, where\na0 is the Bohr radius.And over here you're\ntalking between 10 and 15.So we see an increase\nin size going this way.And then when we go from 3s to\n3p-- so here we have 3 minus 1minus l, which is 1.So we have one node, down to 3d,\n3 minus 1 minus 2, zero nodes.And you see that there\nis a decrease herein the most probable radius.So, OK, interesting.All right, so 3d has the\nsmallest, next 3p, next 3s.So there's two different\ntrends we're seeing.One, as we increase l\nwithin the same n number,and one going from a smaller\nvalue of n to a larger value,and then again within\nthe 3, within the n valueas we change l.So again, to say the same\nthing in a different way,as n increases from 2 to 3, the\nradius, most probable radiusor the size increases.So from here to here we\nhave an increase in size.I just want to make\nsure people havetime to kind of get all of this\ndown, but it should be good.I have a little\npicture that just showsthey're very different in size.So we'll go back to this again.And then as I also said, as\nl increases for a given n--so from l equals 0\nto l equals 1 here,then we have a\ndecrease in the size.", "start": 3120.0, "heat": 0.419}, {"text": "So you can see the most\nprobable radius moves over.And then here is\nanother within n.And n equals 3.We see, again, this decrease.So those are the\ntwo trends that youobserve when you look at\nthese radial probabilitydistributions.So for exam one next\nweek, you shouldbe able to draw\ndistributions like this.You should be able to\ntell me how many radialnodes you have for\ndifferent types of orbitals.And you should know\nthese trends in size.So I think in the\nexam instructionsit says up to a 5 case.You don't have to go on forever\nto be able to draw them,but you should be\nable to look at theseand tell what kind of orbital\nit is and where the nodes are,be able to draw where the\nnodes are-- one node here,one, two, one node here.This kind of thing will\nbe on the exam next week.So there's something that's a\nlittle counterintuitive whenit comes to this size issue.And that has to do with\nhow this correlatesto the amount of shielding,\nand as we see later,to the energy levels.So only electrons\nin the s state herereally have any kind of\nsubstantial probabilitythat they'll be\nclose to the nucleus.So we have this\nlittle blip over herethat is close to the nucleus,\nthat at are very smallradii, very small values of r.Even though the most\nprobable is out here,if we compare 3s to 3p and\nlook at where the electrons arethat are closest to the\nnucleus, they're quite a bitfarther away than in the 3s.Or there's more\nprobability that there'sgoing to be some closer here.And then the closest probability\nover here for these electronsis quite a bit farther away.So we see these circles\nkind of move out.So even though the\noverall radius,", "start": 3240.0, "heat": 0.378}, {"text": "the sort of size of the\nwhole thing is decreasing,the probability\nthat there are goingto be electrons really\nclose is actuallygoing in the opposite direction.And so what this means\nis that s electronsare the least shielded\nbecause there'shigher probability that they'll\nbe some close to the nucleus.There's more penetration\nclose to the nucleus.So s electrons are\nthe least shielded.And we're going to\ncome back to this whenwe move on to today's handout.This is really important\nin terms of thinkingabout the energy levels.And I'm going to\nhave these diagramson the handout for today.So we'll see them again.All right, so before we\nmove to that handout,we've got to finish\nour quantum numbersand talk about electron spin.So the fourth quantum\nnumber describesthe spin on the electron.And we already saw the\nmagnetic quantum number m.We saw m sub l.And now we have m sub s.And the s stands for spin.So there's some nomenclature\nthat actually makes sense.So there are two possible\nspin values for an electron.And s can equal plus 1/2, spin\nup, or minus 1/2, spin down.And here are some\nlittle pictures of that.So this ms term, this spin\nmagnetic quantum number,completes the description\nof the electron.But it's not dependent\non the orbital.To describe an\norbital completely,you only need three\nquantum numbers.But to describe the\nelectron, you need four.And that is shown, again,\nhere on this picture,or on this slide.You need three quantum numbers.You need n, l, and m sub l to\ndescribe the quantum number,", "start": 3360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "describe the orbital completely.But you need a fourth\none, this m subs to describe the electron.So if you see wave\nfunction n, l, m sub l,you say that's telling\nme what the orbital is.And if we add the m sub\ns, then you look at thatand say oh, that's\ngoing to tell meall the way to the\nelectron what is going on.So this final quantum\nnumber led to whatwe know as Pauli's\nexclusion principle, whichis that no two electrons can\nhave the same four quantumnumbers.They can't have the same--\nno two electrons can havethe same spin, in other words.So if we are drawing a\nconfiguration for neonwith 10 electrons,\nwe are going to havewith one electron being\nup spin, the next oneis going to be down.Because if we had two\nof these both going up,they would have the same\nfour quantum numbers.And that's not allowed by\nPauli's exclusion principle.So when you have two\nhere, one spin up,one spin down in\nan orbital, thenwe say that those\nelectrons are paired.And an important thing that\nkind of comes out of all of thisis that one orbital can't\nhold more than two electrons.If it did, there'd\nbe another electronthat would have the same\nfour quantum numbers.Because you need three\nquantum numbers to describethe electron, or the orbital.We need three to describe, say,\nthat it's n equals 1, and thenits s state.So we need those other ones to\ndescribe the orbital and thenthe fourth one to\ndescribe the spin.So if we add another\nelectron, you'dhave two that were spin up, say.", "start": 3480.0, "heat": 0.214}, {"text": "And that just wouldn't work.So you cannot have more than two\nelectrons in the same orbital.And this makes a\nlot of sense whenyou think about why you would\nbe putting electrons in orbitalsthat are higher energy.Why not just keep putting him\nin the low energy orbital?And it's because\nyou can't do that.You can't put more\nthan two electrons in.And so therefore once you've\nfilled a lower energy orbital,you've got to move up to the\nnext lowest energy orbital.", "start": 3600.0, "heat": 0.21}]
