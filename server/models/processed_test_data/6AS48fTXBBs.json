away.And you'd plot curves of\nhow often the animal pressedthese levers so you would get\na quantitative theory of howmuch he learned and how\nmuch it could remember,and how many trials\nit would have to do.And then instead of just\nlooking at reactions to stimuli,they quickly switched to\ntrying to teach the animalthings by giving it\nto two alternatives--turn left or turn right, or\npush this

of their memorydepends a lot on\nhow recent it wasand on how powerful the\nreward was, and blah, blah.And so they get\nthese little setsof rules that look\nlike Newton's laws,and that was the kind
