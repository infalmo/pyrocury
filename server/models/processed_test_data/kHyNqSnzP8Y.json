quiz\nfive type problems,where I ask you questions to\nsee if you were here and awake.So a typical question\nmight be, Professor Winstonis a creationist, or\nsomething like that.Not too hard to answer.In any event, if it's been hard\nto develop a real understandingof intelligence,\noccasionally the hopeis that by mimicking biology\nor mimicking evolution,you can circumnavigate\nall the problems.And one of those\nkinds of effortsis ever to imitate evolution.So we're going to talk\ntoday about so calledgenetic algorithms,\nwhich are naive attemptsto mimic naive evolution.Now, I realize that most MIT\nstudents have a basic graspof sexual reproduction.But I've found in\ntalking with studentsthat many times, they're\na little fuzzy on someof the details.So let's start off by reflecting\na little bit about howthat works.So let's see, we\nneed pink and blue.And here's our cell,\nand here is its nucleus,and here are mommy and\ndaddy's chromosomes.We'll just pretend\nthere's one pair.Now ordinarily, in ordinary cell\ndivision, you get two cells.Both have a nucleus, and the\nprocess of producing theminvolves the duplication\nof those chromosomes.", "start": 120.0, "heat":

chromosomesget all twisted up, and they\nbreak, and they recombine.So when we talk about\nthe cells that split offfrom one of these\ngerm cells, it'sno longer appropriate to\ntalk about the pink oneand the blue one, because\nthe pink one and the blue oneare all mixed up.So you get two chromosomes\nhere and two here.But through some miracle\nof nature, which has alwaysamazed me, these two\ncells split, in turn,into four cells altogether.And each of those four\ncells at the bottomgets one of the\nchromosomes that wasproduced by the twisting up\nof the rope and recombination.Then, along comes\na special occasion.And now we can think of this\nas being a blue one and thisas being a pink one.And they come together, and\nyou get a new person, like so.Note that your mother\nand father's chromosomesare never, never recombined.It's your grandparents\nchromosomes that recombine.So that's what it's like.And the main thing\nto note about thisis-- well, a couple things.If you

youwere born, if you\nhappen to be a female,in this part of the\nprocess over here.Then, of course, more\ndice got thrown herewhen the decision\nwas made about whichparticular cells got to fuse\nto form a new individual.So I want to beat on this\nidea of lots of choice.When we talk about\ngenetic algorithms,and we talk about nature, there\nare lots of choices in there.And that means there\nare lots of choicesto intervene, to screw around,\nto make things work outthe way you want.But in any event, there we are.That's the basic idea, and it\nall starts with chromosomes.So we could think

some\nstring of thingsthat determine how the\nultimate system behaves.So it all starts out, then,\nwith some of these chromosomes,some of these\nsimulated chromosomes,simulated,\nsimplified, and

subject to mutation.And you'll note, here's a\nwhole bunch of choice already.How many of these mutations\ndo you allow per chromosome,for example?How many of the chromosomes\njust slip throughwithout any mutation?Those are choices you can make.Once you've made\nthose choices, then wehave the crossover phenomenon.Let's identify one of these\nguys as the pink one and oneof these guys as the blue

part of the other,and we fuse them together.And some may slip by without\nany of that, like so.Well, these things are meant to\nbe combined in pairs, like so,but they may not have\nany crossover in

one, which\nmight be 0.6 and 0.2.So the mutation\noperator is goingto take one of those values\nand change it a little bit.So it might say, well, we'll\ntake 3, and we'll make it 0.2.", "start":

together.So you saw already some\nthat were evolving to swim.These are evolving to\nmove around on the land.It's interesting-- this was done\nby Karl Sims, who at the timewas at a then thriving\ncompany, Thinking Machines,a fresh spinoff from MIT.So he was using a vastly\nparallel computer,super powerful for its day,\nthousands of processors,to do this.And it was a demonstration\nof what you coulddo with lots of computing.In the early stages of\nthe experimentation,though, its notion of physics\nwasn't quite complete,so some of the creatures evolved\nto move by hitting
