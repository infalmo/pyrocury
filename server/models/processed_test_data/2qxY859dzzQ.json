[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Hi.Well, if you're ready,\nthis will be theother big side of calculus.We still have two functions,\nas before.Let me call them the height and\nthe slope: y of x and theslope, s of x.Function one and function two.That's what calculus is about.And earlier, we figured out how\nto go from function one ifwe knew that, how to\nfind the slope.Of course, it was easy when\nfunction one was just astraight line.Then the slope was just\nup divided by across.But when function\none was curving,we had to do something.We had to take just a small\ndistance across, a smalldistance up and divide,\nand then let smallget smaller and smaller.The result of that was function\ntwo, the derivative.Today, we're going\nthe other way.We know the slope.We know s of x, and we want\nto find the height, yof x, of the graph.We know how the graph is sloping\nat every point, and wehave to put all that information\ntogether to findits height.OK.Let me say the easiest way to\ndo it, when it works, is torecognize if we are given a\nformula for the slope, to", "start": 0.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "recognize maybe we know a height\nthat goes with it.Let me take an example.So the one, and most important\ncase of a heightis x to some power.x to n.That's one that everybody\nlearns.When y is x to the nth, the\nresult of this process thatproduces function two going in\nthat direction is dy/dx isthat n comes down and we\nhave one lower power.So if we happen to have that\nas our slope, that would beour height.Nothing more to do.But many other slopes\nare possible.Let's just stay with this\nanother minute.What if the slope was\nx to the nth itself?What if we started with function\ntwo as x to the nth.Suppose dy/dx is x to the nth\npower, like x squared.Where does x squared\ncome from?Well, look at this rule.That rule said that for these\npower functions, the powerdrops by one.So if I want to end up with x\nto the nth, going backwards,function one had better be,\ninvolve an x to the n plus 1.But that's not perfect, of\ncourse, because when I takethe slope of that one, this\nfactor, this power, thisexponent, n plus n\nwill come down.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.303}, {"text": "Just as n came down to here, n\nplus 1 will come down, andtherefore I'd better divide by\nn plus 1 so that when I dotake the slope, when I do go to\nnumber two, the n plus 1'swill cancel.The power will drop by one, and\nI'll have x to the nth.OK, there's an example--quite a useful one--of going from step two to\nstep one just by kind ofrecognizing what\nyou want there.So this is one set that\neverybody learns.Another is sines and cosines,\nif you can fit it into that.Another is either\nthe x or logx.That's pretty much the list.\nAnd then you learn, in thefuture, ways to change things\naround to fit into one ofthose forms. But then,\nof course, thereare many, many cases--many, many functions, too-- that\nyou don't fit, can't fitinto a form where you can\nrecognize from some list whichyou either have learned or you\nfind on the web or you find inthe calculator.A lot of lists have been made\nto help you go from two toone, but today we have\nto understand whatis the actual process.What is the, what is the the\nreverse process to this one?And of course, this one involved\na limit as delta xwent to 0, because always I have\nto remember that thingscan be curving, things can be\nchanging, I can't assume thatthey're saying the same.And then, the reverse\ndirection.Maybe I just tell you first\nwhat the symbol is.If I have this s of x and I want\nto get back to y of x--", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "so this is from two to one--one will be y of x.The symbol for y\nof x will be--it's, I'm just really wanting to\ndraw that integral symbol.The integral, I would say the\nintegral of s of x dx.And you'll see why--this is, that's an s--you'll see why that's a\nreasonable way to write it.But of course, first, we need\nthe idea behind it.OK, so how am I going\nto proceed?Step one, I'll take steps, I\nwon't try to get immediatelyto the case of continuous\nchange.I'll take single, individual\nsteps.Let me do that.And then, I'm going to\ntake smaller steps.And then in the limit, I'm\ntaking continuous steps.OK, so first, big steps.So let me put down, for example,\nsuppose I have y's.Suppose the y's stepped up like\n0, 1, 4, 9, 16, whatever.So those are heights, and, of a\ngraph that's sort of piecesof straight lines, only\nchanging a few times.What would be the slopes?Going now, this is\none going to two.The slope is s.Well, the slope, if the step\nsize is one and I go up byone, the slope will be 1.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "Here I go up by 3.Here I go up by 5.Here I go up by 7.So if I, to go from there to\nthere, I'm taking differences.I'm taking delta

plus 3 plus5 is the 9, 1 plus\n3 adds 7 more.You're up to 16 and onwards.So if going this way is a\nsubtraction at each step,going this way is a kind\nof running addition.I add up all the slopes to\nsee how far I've climbed.Let me do a second example,\njust to make that point.Let me start you this time,\nlet me start you with theslopes, because that's\ntoday's job.Suppose the slopes are\n4, 3, 2, 1, 0.So if these were speeds,\nI would say,OK, I'm slowing down.I'm slowing down, but I'm\nstill moving forward.Positive speeds, but putting\nthe brakes on.What would be the distances?If the

any\nbunch of numbers and I can doit with letters.So now I move from arithmetic\nto algebra.Algebra just means I'll do it\nwith any letters, but I'm notyet doing it continuously,\nwhich is whatcalculus will do.So with letters, I have here y0,\ny1, y2, y3, y4, let's say.So those are the y's.Now what are the slopes between\nthem if the stepacross is 1?So what are the steps upward,\nwhat are the delta y's?Well, y1 minus y0, y2 minus y1,\ny3 minus y2, y4 minus y3.And then my question is these\nare the s's, these are thedelta y's, you could say.These are the y's.What happens if I add\nall those delta y's?Do you see what happens?What happens if I add those\nfour changes toget the total change?Well, when I add those, do you\nsee that y1 will cancel minusy1, y2 will cancel minus

first. y end minus ystart is the sum of\nthe delta y's.Simple algebra.Reminding us again and again and\nagain that the opposite,the inverse to go the other way\nfrom two to one, we addpieces to get back to the y's.Now I'm coming closer to what I\nwant, but I'm moving towardcalculus now.So calculus, I got there by\ndelta y's over delta x's.So in moving toward calculus,\nwhat am I doing?I'm thinking of the changes\ndelta y oversmaller steps delta x.So I just want to\ntake this step.I want to divide by delta x\nand multiply by delta x.Why do I do that?", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.0},

x,\nthe small step that's goingto 0 but hasn't got there yet.And I'm adding and I get the\nlast one minus the first one.Now here comes the\nlimiting step.So the limiting step will be\nthe limit of this left handside, this sum.So in the limit, I'll have more\nand more and more things.As delta x gets smaller, if\nI'm thinking of some fixedtotal change in x, I'm chopping\nthat up into smallerand smaller pieces, more\nand more pieces.So more and more pieces of the\nslopes at different pointsalong times the size of the\npiece give this answer.So now can I jump to the\nway that I wouldwrite this

was simple, and\nthen by going to the limit,which was not simple.So a whole lot of limit has been\nnot fully explained, andI think the right thing to do\nnow is to do an example.So let me move to an
