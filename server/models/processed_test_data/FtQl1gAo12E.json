[{"text": "PROFESSOR: OK, this lecture\nis about the slopes, thederivatives, of two of the\ngreat functions ofmathematics: sine\nx and cosine x.Why do I say great functions?What sort of motion do we\nsee sines and cosines?Well, I guess I'm thinking\nof oscillations.Things go back and forth.They go up and down.They go round in a circle.Your heart beats and\nbeats and beats.Your lungs go in and out.The earth goes around the sun.So many motions are repeating\nmotions, and that's when sinesand cosines show up.The opposite is growing\nmotions.That's where we have powers of\nx, x cubed, x to the n-th.Or if we really want\nthe motion to getgoing, e to the x.Or decaying would be\ne to the minus x.So there are two kinds here.We're talking about the ones\nthat repeat and stay level,and they all involve\nsines and cosines.And to make that point,\nI'm going to have to--you know what sines and cosines\nare for triangles fromtrigonometry.But I have to make those\ntriangles move.So I'm going to put the triangle\nin a circle, with onecorner at the center, and\nanother corner on the circle,and I'm going to move\nthat point.So it's going to be\ncircular motion.It's going to be the\nmotion that--the perfect model of repeating\nmotion, aroundand around the circle.And then the answer we're going\nto get is just great.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "The derivative of sine x turns\nout to be cosine x.And the derivative of cosine x\nturns out to be minus sine x.You couldn't ask for more.So my interest is always to\nexplain those, but then I wantto really--we're seeing this limit stuff\nin taking a derivative, andhere's a chance for me\nto find a limit.This turns out to be the crucial\nquantity: the sine ofan angle divided by the angle,\nwhen the angle goes to 0.Of course, when it's at 0,\nthe sine of 0 is 0, sowe have 0 over 0.This is the big problem\nof calculus.You can't be at the limit,\nbecause it's 0over 0 at that point.But you can be close to it.And then if we drew a graph, had\na calculator, whatever wedo, we would see that that ratio\nis very close to 1, buttoday we're going to actually\nprove it from the meaning ofsine theta.Now remember what\nthat meaning is.So back to the start\nof the world.Actually back to Pythagoras,\nway, way back.The key fact is what you\nremember about righttriangles, a squared plus b\nsquared equals c squared.That's where everything starts\nfor a right triangle.I don't know if Pythagoras\nknew how to prove it.I think his friends\nhelped him.A lot of people have\nsuggested proofs.Einstein gave a proof.Some US president even\ngave a proof.So it's a fundamental fact, and\nI'm going to divide by csquared, because I'd like the\nright hand side to be 1.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So if I divide by c squared, I\njust have a squared over csquared plus b squared\nover c squared is 1.And I'm going to make that\nhypotenuse in my picture 1.So then this will be the a over\nc, and that ratio of thenear side to the hypotenuse\nis the cosine.So what I have here is\ncosine theta squared.Let me put theta in there.Theta is that angle\nat the center.And what's b?So this is a over c.That's cosine theta.B over c is this point,\nand that's sine theta.And they add to 1.So that's Pythagoras using\nsines and cosines.So this is the cosine.And this vertical distance\nis sine theta.OK, so that's the\ntriangle I like.That's the triangle that's\ngoing to move.As this point goes around the\ncircle at a steady speed, thistriangle is going to move.The base will go left and\nright, left and right.The height will go up and down,\nup and down, followingcosine and sine.And we want to know things\nabout the speed.OK, so that's circular motion.Now I've introduced\nthis word radians.And let me remind you what they\nare and why we need them.Why don't we just use 360\ndegrees for the full circle?360 degrees.Well, that's a nice\nnumber, 360.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Somebody must have thought it\nwas really nice, and chose itfor measuring angles\naround the world.It's nice, but it's\nnot natural.Somebody thought of it,\nso it's not good.What we need is the natural\nway to measure the angle.If we don't use the natural way,\nthen this is the sine--if I measure this x\nin degrees, thatformula won't be right.There will be a miserable factor\nthat I want to be 1.So I have to measure the angles\nthe right way, andhere's the idea of radians.The measure of that\nangle is thisdistance around the circle.That distance I'm going to call\ntheta, and I'm going tosay this angle is theta\nradians whenthat distance is theta.So that now, what's\na full circle?A full circle would mean the\nangle went all the way round.I get the whole circumference,\nwhich is 2 pi.So 360 degrees is\n2 pi radians.So the natural number\nhere is 2 pi.This can't be helped, it's\nthe right one to use.Radians are the right way\nto measure an angle.So now I'm ready to do the job\nof finding this

0.We know what sine theta looks\nlike, and I'm interested inthe slope, the derivative.That's what this subject\nis about, calculus,differentiating.So I want to know the\nslope at that point.And it's 1.And how do we show\nthat it's 1?So now I'm coming to the point\nwhere I'm going to give aproof that is 1.And the proof isn't just for the\nsake of formality or rigoror something.You really have to understand\nthe sine function, the cosinefunction, and this is\nthe heart of it.OK.So we want to show\nthat slope is 1.How am I going to do that?That's the slope, right?If I go a tiny amount theta,\nthen I go up sine theta.So in this average slope, if\nI take a finite step--I could have called it delta\ntheta, but I don't want towrite deltas all the time.So I just go out a little\ndistance theta and up to thesine curve.I stopped at the sine\ncurve by the way.The straight line is a little\nabove the sine curve here.And that ratio, up divided by\nacross, that's the delta sinedivided by delta theta.And because it started at 0,\nit's just sine theta is thedistance up, and theta is\nthe distance across.So this is the average slope.And of course you remember\nwhat

show that sine theta\nover theta is less--sorry, sine theta over theta--well, let me get this right.I might as well put\nit the neat way.I want to show that sine\ntheta is below theta.This is for theta\ngreater than 0.That's what I'm doing.OK.So that tells me that this\ncurve stays under thatstraight line, that 45 degree\nline, which I'm claiming isthe tangent line.And it tells me when I divide\nit by the theta, it tells methat sine theta over\ntheta is below 1.But now how much below 1?Right now if I only know this,\nI haven't ruled out thepossibility that the slope\ncould be much smaller.So I need something below it.And fantastically, the\ncosine is below it.So the other thing that I want\nto prove is that the cosine--and I'll let me do\nit this way.I'm going to show the tangent of\ntheta is bigger than theta.Again, some range of thetas.Positive thetas up\nto somewhere.I don't know, I think\nmaybe pi over 2.But the main point is near\n0, that's the main point.So can I

true,\nthat this picture isright, then--I haven't gone into gory\ndetail about limits.If you really insist,\nI'll do it later.But whatever.You can see this has just got to\nbe true, that if this curveis squeezed between the cosine\ncurve and the 1, then as thetagets smaller and smaller,\nit's squeezed toequal 1 in the limit.Allow me to say that that's\npretty darn clear.OK.Whatever limit meets.So these are the main facts\nthat I need to show.And I need to show those\nusing trig, right?I have to draw some graph\nthat convinces you.And this isn't quite good\nenough, because I

always a good\nidea to keep remindingyourself of what it\nis you're doing.Sine theta is below theta.OK.So why is it?And you see it here.That was sine theta, right?And where was theta?Well, because we measured theta\nin radians, theta isthis curvy distance that's\nclearly longer.The shortest way from this to\nthe axis there is straightdown, and that's sine theta.A slower way is go round and\nend up at not the nearestpoint, and that was theta.Is that good?I could sometimes just to be\neven more convincing, you adda second angle, and you say OK,\nthere's 2 sine thetas andhere is 2 thetas, and

up.It went back to the fundamental\nidea of where sinetheta is in a picture.Now I need another picture.Yeah, I need another picture\nfor number two to show thattan theta is bigger\nthan theta.That was our other job.So essentially, I need that\nsame picture again.Whoops, let me draw\nthat triangle.Yeah, and it's got a circle.OK, that's not a bad circle.It's got an angle theta.And now I'm going to--math has always got\nsome little trick.So this is it.Go all the way out, so now the\nbase is 1, and this is stillthe angle theta.And what else do I know\non that picture?Now I've scaled the

the base half, right?1/2 times the base\ntimes the height.So the area of the triangle\nis 1/2 times thebase 1 times the height.OK.Notice we've got the sign\ngoing the right way.We want tan theta to

in any doubt thatthis piece, this sector that's\ninside the triangle, has anarea less than the area\nof the triangle.So now I just have to remember\nwhy is the area of thissector, half of theta.You know, there's another reason\nwhy areas come up rightwhen we use a radians, when we\nmeasure theta with radians.So remember, just think about\nthis piece of pie compared tothe whole pie.What's the
