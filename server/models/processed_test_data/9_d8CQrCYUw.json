KIM VANDIVER: Today's lecture\nis not mathematically hard,but it's really important to\nestablish vocabulary today.We're going to talk\nabout vibrationfor the rest of the term.And vibration is essentially\napplied dynamics.So up until now, we've been\nfinding equations of motion,but not solving them.Did you notice that?I've almost never asked you to\nsolve the equation of motionthat you've just discovered\nusing Lagrange or whatever.The rest of the\nterm, we're actuallygoing to be talking mostly\nabout the resulting motion.The equations of motion\nare pretty easy to find.You have all the techniques that\nyou need to know for finding.And now, we're going to talk\nabout how things vibrate.So why do we choose vibration?Vibration, one, is an\nincredibly common phenomenon.We wouldn't have speech\nwithout vibration.You wouldn't have musical\ninstruments without vibration.It's a positive thing when\nit's making good music.It's a negative thing when\nit's keeping you awake at nightbecause the air conditioner\nin the next roomis causing something\nto rattle in the roomand it's driving you nuts.So you can want it,\nit can be desirable,and you cannot want it.And you need to know ways\nof getting rid of it.And so we're going to talk\nabout vibration, about makingvibration, about\nsuppressing vibration,about isolating sensitive\ninstruments from the vibration", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "of the floor, things like that.So that's the topic of\nthe rest of the term.And today, we're going to talk\nabout single degree of freedomsystems.And you might think that we're\nspending an awful lot of timeon single degree\nof freedom systems.But actually, there's\na reason for that.Lots of things in\nreal life, like-- thisis just an aluminum rod.This will vibrate.And continuous\nsystems, which this is,have a theoretically infinite\nnumber of degrees of freedom.Yet when it comes to\ntalking about its vibration,it is conceptually easy to\nthink about the vibrationof an object like this,\none natural frequency,one natural mode at a time.And in fact, you can\nmodel that natural modewith its single degree\nof freedom equivalent.And that's the way I\napproach vibration.So if you can isolate\none particular mode,you can literally model it\nas a Mass-Spring-Dashpot.So you need to understand the\nMass-Spring-Dashpot behaviorinside and out, because it's\nthe vocabulary we use to domuch more complicated things.So a single degree\nof freedom system,like the simple pendulum,\nhas a natural frequency.In this case, it has mode shape.Here's another one, kind of\nfun, single degree of freedom.This obviously\ninvolves rotation.And you can figure\nthat out usingLagrange or whatever, single\ndegree of freedom systems.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "But now, I'm going to excite\none mode of vibration of this.[CLANG][HIGH-PITCHED TONE]Hear the real high pitch?I'll get it down here by the\nmic so that people at homecan hear it-- about

HIGH][CLANG]That's bending\nvibration of this thing.But each mode of\nvibration I can thinkof in terms of its equivalent\nsingle degree of freedomoscillate.So we'll get to talking\nabout these thingsa little bit-- continuous\nsystems-- in the last couplelectures of the term.But for today then,\nwe're really goingto develop this vocabulary\naround the vibrationof single degree\nof freedom systems.So let's start.All right.So to keep it from\nbeing totally boring,I'm going to start with a\nlittle Mass-Spring-Dashpot thathas two springs.And they're of such a\nlength that unstretched,they just meet in the middle.And then, I'm going\nto take a mass", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and I'm going to squeeze it\nin between these two springs--I can't draw a spring very\nwell today-- and this is k1and this is k2 and here's m.And we'll put it on a roller\nso it's obviously constrainedto motion in one direction.And I'll pick this\npoint here as the placeI'm going to put my\ninertial coordinate.So my inertial coordinate's\njust measured fromor happens to be where the\nendpoints of these two springswere.Now, to squeeze\nthe spring in here,I have this clearly\npre-compressionin these springs.So we are no longer in a\nzero-force state, right?So and I want to get the\nequations of motion in this.And moreover, I\nwant to predict--I want to find out what's\nthe natural frequencyof this spring.So let's check your intuition.So write down on\nyour piece of paperwhether or not the natural\nfrequency will be differentbecause there's pre-compression,\nor whether or notthat pre-compression\nin the springshas nothing to do with\nthe natural frequency.So write down on your\npaper \"natural frequencyis different\" or \"natural\nfrequency is the same.\"Let's have a prediction here.And then, we'll set\nabout figuring this outand in the course\nof doing it, we'lldevelop a little vocabulary.All through the\ncourse so far, whenwe've done equations\nof motion, we'veusually picked the\nzero-spring-force position.And we sort of led you down\nthis rosy path that suggeststhat's the way we do it.But there are other\nways that you'regoing to find that are\npreferable to that, sometimes.So that's one of the reasons\nI'm doing this example.So let's do a free body diagram.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.145}, {"text": "And if I held this\nmass, for example,right at the center when\nI put the springs in,it's obvious that this\nspring gets compressedby half of the\nlength of the massand this spring gets\ncompressed by halfof the length of\nthe mass, right?So this is going to be L long.So if I held it\nright in the middle,it would compress L/2 and L/2.But then, when I release\nit, if these springsare a different\nspring constant, it'sgoing to move a little bit.So the force on this\nside pushing backis sum k1 times L/2\nminus the distancethat I move in that direction,\nwhich would relieve it.And the force on this\nside also pushes back.It's k2 times L/2 over\n2 plus x, because whenI go in that direction, I'm\ncompressing it even further.And those are the total\nforces in the x-directionon this body.There's an N and an\nmg, which we knowwe don't have to deal\nwith because we're onlyinterested in motion\nleft and right.All right?So we can say sum of the\nforces in the x-direction,mass times the acceleration.And those forces are k1 L/2\nminus x minus k2 L/2 plus x.And that's the complete equation\nof motion for this problem.And rearrange it so\nthat I get the functionsof x together here.So mx double dot plus\nk1

frequency?I won't ask you to embarrass\nyourselves, but a few of youprobably got that\nwrong, all right?So there's a lesson in this\nthat I want you to go away with.and I'll say it once.And that is when\nan external forcehas nothing to do with\nthe motion coordinatesin the problem.It doesn't affect the\nnatural frequency.These come from external forces.These are these\npre-compressions, right?And I can separate them out and\nthey are not functions of x.The stuff on the right-hand\nside of the equation,that's not a function\nof the motion variable--cannot affect the\nnatural

kind of a nuisance\nterm in terms of dealingwith a differential equation.It'd be a lot nicer if the\nright-hand side were 0.So I want to make the\nright-hand side of this one 0.And draw a use of a\nconclusion from that.First thing I need\nto know is I'dlike to know what is the static\nequilibrium position of this.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And when you go to compute\nstatic

constant, justa value, plus a\ndynamic component I'llcall x of d, which moves.This is the function of time.This is a constant.It's not a function of time.And that means if I\ntake its derivative,I might need a value for x dot.That goes away.It's just xd dot.And x double dot\nis xd double dot.And let's substitute this\ninto my equation of motion.So it becomes m xd double\ndot plus k1 plus k2

the static case,then this goes away.For the static equilibrium\ncase, this term is 0.This term is 0 because\nthe dynamic motionis 0 in the static case.That xd is motion about the\nstatic equilibrium position.So for static case,\nthese two terms go awayand we know that\nthis equals that.But if that's true, we\ncan get rid of these.They cancel one another.These terms cancel and I'm\nleft with m xd

differential equation,you will find it advantageous to\nwrite your equations of motionaround the static\nequilibrium position.So I could have started\nthis problem by saying,whatever the static\nequilibrium position isof this thing, that's\nwhat I'm measuring x from.And then, I would have come\nto this equation eventually.You'd have to figure out what is\nthe static equilibrium

it'sgoing to change the\nbehavior of the systemfrom vibrating to not vibrating.So now, there's four\npossible solutions to this.I'm not going to elaborate on\nall of them, but zeta equals 0,we've already done.We know the answer to that.Response to initial\nconditions-- simple.We know that one.We have another solution\nwhen zeta's greater than 1.When zeta's greater than\n1, this quantity hereis the inside is greater than 1,\nso it's a real positive number.And both the roots of this\nthing are completely real.And you know that the--\nremember the response,we hypothesize in the\nbeginning that

these are just\npure real values.And you'll find out that the\nsystem from initial conditionson velocity and\ndisplacement just--[WINDS DOWN]and dies out.Zeta equals to 1.Then, st is just minus-- you get\na double root-- minus omega nt,twice.And the solution for this, I\ncan write out the whole thing.x of t here is just\nsome A1 plus t A2 eto the minus zeta omega n t.And again, it looks--\nit's just some kindof damp, not very interesting\nresponse, no oscillations.And then finally,\nzeta less than 1.And this is the only one--\nthis one produces oscillation.And the solution for st is plus\nor

answer,what does it tell you that\nthe solution looks like?AUDIENCE: Sines and cosines.J.

to this, what I'm coming upwith is a way of\nestimating-- purposelydoing this-- is this transient\ncurve we know is controlledby a damping, by zeta.I want to have an experimental\nway to determine what is zeta.And I do it by computing\nsomething calledthe logarithmic decrement.So if I take the natural\nlog of x of t over x of tplus n periods, it's the\nnatural log of this expression.So I just
