about the empirical\nproperties of stocks and bonds.I want you to\ndevelop an intuitionfor how to think about markets.We've already done that over the\ncourse of the last few lecturesby looking at market\nprices and understandinghow to price them,\nbut I'd like youto get some kind of a\nhistorical perspectivenow on specific asset classes.Because we're going to be\nrelying on market pricesto make inferences about\nother kinds of securitiesand other decisions\nyou're going to make.As I told you at the very\nbeginning of the course,we're going to rely on\nmarkets for information,because it's the wisdom of\ncrowds that really gets usthe information we\nneed in order to makegood financial decisions.So I want to begin that\nprocess of now giving youthe intuition about\nthe wisdom of crowdsby looking at the historical\nperformance of stocksand bonds.And then we're going\nto talk about howto quantify risk\nmore analyticallyand put it all together in the\nvery basics of modern portfoliotheory.So I want to start by\nasking the question, firstof all, what characterizes\nUS equity returns?How do we get our arms around\nthe behavior of that assetclass?And the way I'm\ngoing to do that is", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "to give you some\nperformance statisticsabout the volatility, about\nthe average return, about howpredictable they are,\nand also patternsof returns across\ndifferent kinds of stocks.So we're going to look at\nsome empirical anomaliesbefore actually turning to\nthe analytical work of tryingto figure out how to make\nsense of this from a moreformal mathematical framework.Before I do that, let me ask\nyou to think about the followingquestion, which is, if you are\ndesigning a market for stocks,what properties would you\nwant that market to have?And I'm going to\nargue that thereare a few properties\nthat all of us, I think,can recognize as being good\nproperties for stock prices.So the first is that\nstock market pricesare random and unpredictable.Now, that might seem a\nlittle counterintuitive,and certainly I think\nyou would acknowledgethat over the last\nseveral weeks markets havebeen supremely unpredictable.And that doesn't feel so good.It doesn't seem like\nthat's a good thing.But in a minute,\nI'm going to tryto make that a little\nbit more clear by lookingat the alternative\nof predictable--or unpredictable,\nwhich is predictable.So let me come\nback to that point.The second property that\nI think you'll agreeis a reasonable one\nfor us to expectis that prices should react\nquickly to new information.It should adjust\nto new informationreally without\nany kind of delay.And finally, we'd like to\nsee that investors shouldn'tbe able to earn abnormal returns\nafter you adjust for risk.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So in other words,\nonce risk adjustmentis taken into account,\nthere shouldn'tbe any additional\nreturn left over.That's what we think of as\na well-functioning market.Another way of putting\nit is that a marketis highly competitive.It's hard to make\nmoney in those markets.Now, they may not be markets\nthat you would enjoy tradingin, but that's not the question.The question is, what\nwould be a good market,an efficient market?So let me talk about\npredictability for a minute,because I said that it seems\na little counterintuitivethat a good market is one\nthat's not predictable.So let's pretend that\nthis is the stock market.This is the S&P 500.That looks nice-- a\nnice, regular curve.Anybody come up with\na prediction for this?How would you go about\npredicting the behaviorof this kind of a stock market?What's that?STUDENT: Cyclical.PROFESSOR: Cyclical.What kind of curve\nwould you fit to this?STUDENT: Sine wave.PROFESSOR: Yeah, sine wave.In fact, that's how\nI generated this.I used a sine wave, and\nthen I add a little noise.Now, why might this not be\na good model for a market?If this were the stock\nmarket, what would you do?Yeah?STUDENT: Everybody\nwould buy on the lowand sell them high\n[INAUDIBLE] the other end.PROFESSOR: Exactly.After a few of these cycles,\nyou sort of get the idea.And if you're down here, you're\ngoing to think, well, gee,I think it's likely\nto go back up so I'mgoing to buy a ton over here.And when you get right up there,\nyou'll say, gee, you know,I think it's time\nfor me to sell a ton.And you don't have to go\nthrough too many of thesebefore you get richer\nthan your wildest dreams.Yeah?STUDENT: I would think that\n[INAUDIBLE] regular marketlike that is not\ntrue, because as soonas you want it to raise,\nit's going to collapseat 50, 10 points below.PROFESSOR: That's exactly right.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So as soon as you\nstart doing this,as soon as you try to do this,\nwhat happens to the pattern?The pattern\ndisappears-- exactly.You see, this is\none of the reasonswhy finance is a lot more\nchallenging than physics.In physics, if you try to drop\na ball in a gravitational field,it won't change its\nmind and say gee,now I'm going to change the\ngravitational constant on youjust because you're testing me.But in financial\nmarkets, the momentyou try to take advantage\nof this pattern, the patternchanges.In fact, the more\nyou try to takeadvantage of it, the more\nquickly the pattern changes.In fact, if you do this a lot--if there are a lot of people\ntrying to predict patterns--then you know what you get?You get no pattern.You get randomness.That's the idea behind an\nefficient market being random.If it were not random,\nthen that meansthat there aren't\nenough people whoare bothering to try\nto forecast the priceand incorporate\ninformation into the price.Now, I said two things that\nat first seemed different,but in fact they're opposite\nsides of the same coin.When you are forecasting\nmarket prices,you know what you're doing?You're actually\nhelping markets becomemore efficient by incorporating\ninformation into that price.How do you do that?Well, if, for example,\nyou think that havinga presidential election\nwill cause volatilityto decline, then if\nyou know that there'sa presidential\nelection coming up,you will start trading in a way\nthat will ultimately be bettingon volatility declining.As you start that trading, you\nforce that volatility indexto go down.So the fact that\nyou've got informationand you think you\ncan forecast prices,when you use the\ninformation, whatdoes it mean to\nuse the informationwhen you buy or sell\nsecurities on the basis", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "of that information?Then the price of the\nsecurity ultimatelyreflects the information, right?So an efficient market is one\nwhere you don't have this.You don't have a very\nstrong predictability.If it is strongly\npredictable, then most likelyeither the market is rigged,\nor there aren't enough peoplethat are trading in order to\nmake prices fully reflectiveof all available information.Now, this is the way\nmarkets really look.These are random\nwalks with drift,drift meaning there's a positive\ntrend or, in some cases,a negative trend.But otherwise, it's\nrandom around that trend.So you can't really\neasily forecast it.And you can see that\nprices go up, they go down.There are long periods\nwhere they go up,but there are also, for other\nstocks, long periods wherethey go down.And you don't know what's\ngoing to happen next.This is a sign of a\nvery efficient market.A while ago, there\nwas an academic studythat was done to try\nto test for efficiency,and one of the tests was\nthat if the underlying priceseries was not very\nvolatile, that wasconsidered an efficient market.But it turned out\nthat was roundlycriticized because of the point\nthat just because a market isnot volatile, it doesn't\nmean that it's working well.And an example\nwas, at the time--this was, like, 20 or 30 years\nago-- the Chinese stock market,the Shanghai Stock Exchange.It was a relatively young\nmarket, and at that time,there were only two\nstocks that traded on it.It was the National Railroad\nCompany and the Bank of China.And at that time,\nwhich is, again,about 15 or 20 years\nago, it was considered", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "unpatriotic to sell the\nsecurity if you had bought it.So you could buy it, but you\nweren't allowed to sell it.And so the price went\nway up and up and up,and that's not an example\nof an efficient market.It was not at all volatile.But as a result, there\nwas no real informationreflected in that price.Yeah?STUDENT: India is talking\nabout getting out.It looks like somebody's doing\none of those roller coasterrides that goes up and\ndown and up and down.So is volatility a sign of [?\ninefficient ?] [INAUDIBLE]?PROFESSOR: Well, it's not\nvolatility, per se, but ratherthe combination of the\npredictability per unitvolatility.That's really what\nyou want to focus on.We're going to come back to that\nwhen we talk about portfoliotheory and look at this\ntrade-off between riskand expected return.But no, I wouldn't say that the\nIndian market is inefficient.It's undergoing some\npretty significant changes,as is the US and\nas is the world.But that's because\nthe global economyis contracting as\nwe know it becauseof this financial crisis.So I wouldn't characterize it\nas inefficient at this point,but that remains to be seen.Yeah?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] down\nthe road [INAUDIBLE] market[INAUDIBLE]?PROFESSOR: There isn't any\nhard and fast rule, no.But if you take a look\nat the trade-off of riskto reward, in other\nwords that ratioof expected return\nto volatility,you can come up\nwith rules of thumbthat will give you a sense\nof whether or not a market isefficient or inefficient.So we're going to\ncome back to that.In fact, we'll look at\nthat in just a minute.Let me turn to some\ndata now, and then wecan see exactly what those\ntrade-offs look like.Now, what's going to be\ninteresting about this partof the talk is that when I\ntell you about these numbers,these numbers are\nbased upon data fromI think it was 1946 to 2001.In fact, a lot of the data\nthat has been collectedover the last year is very,\nvery different from this,so it will be interesting\nto sort of compare the two.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So there are four\nempirical factsthat I want you to take with\nyou about the US stock market.The first is that interest\nrates, in general,have been slightly positive\non average, but not by much.In other words, the\nreal interest rate,the nominal interest rate\nminus inflation rate,has been pretty low over\nthe course of history.So the first fact\nis that real rateshave been slightly positive.So you can see, for example,\nthe average rate of returnfor the one-year T-bill\nis about 38 basispoints on a monthly basis.This is monthly.I haven't annualized it.But inflation over\nthat same periodis about 32 basis points.So when you subtract\nthe two, you'regoing to get six basis\npoints on a monthly basisas the real rate of interest.On the other hand, if you take\na look at the stock market,which is represented\nby VW stock index--VW doesn't mean\nVolkswagen. VW standsfor the value weighted index.It's an index of all\nthe stocks on the NYSE,Amex, and NASDAQ\nweighted accordingto their outstanding\nmarket capitalization.And you can see that\nthe valuated stockmarket over this period\nis about 1% per month.The equal weighted\nstock market, EW,is a little bit higher, 1.18.And Motorola over this period\nhad an expected rate of returnof about 1.66% per month.So the return has been\nhigher for these indexes.And if you want to get a\nsense of why that might be,take a look at the\nnext column, whichis the standard deviation.This, remember, is a measure of\nthe riskiness of the security.It's a measure of\nthe fluctuations.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And if you take a look\nat the equal weightedand the valuated,\nthe volatility is--they're both a lot\nhigher than for T-bills.So this is one of the reasons\nwe got the idea in financethat there's a\nrisk-reward trade-off.The more risky, the higher\nthe expected rate of return.And if you look at Motorola,\nthe riskiness of Motorolais much larger than that of\nany of the stock indexes.Instead of a 5% monthly\nstandard deviation,you're looking at\ndouble, or 10%,the monthly standard deviation.But look at the rate of return.The rate of return is\ncommensurately higher.Yeah, Remi?STUDENT: Professor, why\n[INAUDIBLE] standard deviationgreater than zero?Isn't that [INAUDIBLE]?PROFESSOR: Oh, because it\nfluctuates from month to month.So the idea is if you're buying\na T-bill and you're holding it,it still has price fluctuation.The other thing that\nI want you to seeis something along the lines\nof the minimum and the maximum.This is another\nway of representingthe riskiness of the security.So T-bills are bounded\nbetween 0.03 and 1.34 in termsof their return--very narrow band.Treasury notes, which\nare 10-year instruments,obviously are going to be\nswinging around much more, morethan a one year T-bill.So the longer the maturity,\nthe longer the duration,the riskier is the instrument.But if you take a look\nat the valuated returnand the equal weighted\nreturn and then Motorola,you can see progressively\nmore and more risk involvedin these kinds of securities.Now, if you look at their\ncompound growth rates,you get what you pay for,\nin the sense that you're", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "looking at T-bills down here.So $1 invested in\none of these guyswill give you maybe\n$10 at the end of 2001,but you're looking at a\nmuch, much larger returnfor either the valuated\nor equal weighted indexes.More risk, more\nexpected return--that's the message that you get\nfrom looking at the basic datahere.Now, that's just to give\nyou a sense of whereinterest rates have been.I think we discussed this\nwhen we did fixed income.Interest rates have really\nbeen all over the map.There was a point\nin our history,not that long ago, where\nthe short-term interestrate, the one year T-bill,\nwas something like 16% to 17%per year.That's the one-year T-bill.It's astonishing.But that was a\nperiod where therewas a large amount of\ninflation in the United States.On the other hand, if you take a\nlook at the more recent period,interest rates have\nbeen extremely low,and that's part of the reason\nwe're in a credit crisis,is because credit is very cheap.So you can get yourself\ninto a lot of troublewhen it's relatively\neasy for you to borrow,and it doesn't cost you that\nmuch in terms of the payments.Now, let me show you what\nthe total returns looklike for these\ndifferent asset classes.By total returns, I mean if you\nbought one of these instrumentsand you held it\na month at a timeand you computed the return\nfor holding that instrument.So for a bond, it includes\nwhatever coupons get paid,plus the price fluctuations.It's the total return.For stocks, it'll include\nthe dividends that got paidas well as the\nprice fluctuations.And I'm going to do this\non the exact same scale,from minus 25% to 25%.So these are monthly\nreturns now that I'mplotting from 1946 to 2001.And so you can see that\nthe total return for the US10-year bond actually has\ndifferent periods where,", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "in some cases, it's not very\nrisky but in other casesit bounces around a great deal.When there's a fair amount\nof interest rate uncertainty,you get a lot of volatility,\nbut when markets are notmoving around that much\non the interest rate side,you get periods that\nare relatively calm.Yes?STUDENT: In the previous\nslide, that interest rateare the yield to\nmaturities, right?PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.That's right.Correct.These are yields to maturity.These are total returns, though.These are what you\nget as an investor.This is what you get if you\nhold a particular securityto maturity.Basically, on a given day,\nyou will get these spot rates.You have a question?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] 10 year.So in '81 and '82,\nyou could buy any bondfrom the year '86 [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Yeah.STUDENT: So [INAUDIBLE] that\nincorporates future [INAUDIBLE]interest rates, right?PROFESSOR: Well,\nand also inflation.STUDENT: And that inflation--\nwas it people thinkingthat inflation was going to be\n[INAUDIBLE] 10% of the year,the 10 years out?PROFESSOR: Either\nthat, or they feltthat that, plus whatever\ninterest rate expectations,was going to be\nwhat you're goingto get over a 10-year period.Yep.That's right.STUDENT: And mentally, people\nthink that stock [INAUDIBLE][? upon ?] [? death.\n?] [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Apparently.And there was a time, in fact,\nwhen the stock market did yieldthat for quite a bit of time.Absolutely.On the other hand, let me\nturn it around and ask you,now that interest rates are at--I don't know, the 10-year I\nthink is at-- or the 30 year isat 4.17 this morning--do you think for the\nnext 40 years or 30 yearsthat treasury bills are only\ngoing to return 4% a year?", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Is that realistic?I mean, it's not so\neasy to say, is it?When you're in the midst of\nit, it's not so easy to say.Based upon historical\nevidence, itseems crazy to think\nthat we could possiblybe in such a low interest rate\nenvironment over the next 30years, especially given\nthat we're printing moneylike it's going\nout of style now.And we're going to be doing that\nover the next couple of years.We've got to, because\nsomebody's gotto pay for all of\nthese rescue packages.And so we basically\nhave to engagein some kind of inflationary\nmonetary and fiscal policy.But it's still saying\n4.17 as of this morning.So the market does the best\nit can, given the data,but it's hard to forecast.And we just said at the\nbeginning of this classthat it better be\nhard to forecast,because if it's not\nhard to forecast,then something's wrong.Then it means that\nit's not reflectingall available information.Yeah?STUDENT: When you showed that\ngraph in the previous slideof the stocks going way up,\nI'm wondering how much of thatis due to the fact that this\nwas just a really good periodof the United States and if\nyou compare to other countriesat other times.PROFESSOR: Yeah, that\nis definitely a factor.So I'm not trying to\nexplain the numbers,and I'm not trying\nto justify them.You're absolutely right.This is a very special country\nin a very special time.So you can either thank your\ngood fortune that you're here,or you can argue that, well,\nit's not going to persistand time to move to wherever.But I don't know.I don't know which that is.But it is very unusual.If you look at other\ncountries, thereare other countries that\nare having difficultiesduring this time period, but\nthere are other countriesthat are growing even faster.If you look at China\nover the last 10 years,the growth rate of\nthe Chinese economyis double to triple\nwhat the US economy.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Now, it was a smaller\neconomy, but stillover an extended\nperiod of time it'sgot tremendous growth rate.So that really is\nthe challenge, isto try to understand\nwhat's goingon in the context of where we're\nliving and how we're living.So let me go through and\nshow you some more numbers,and then we can talk about\nsome of the interpretations.So this is the total\nreturn for the US 10-year.You've get a sense\nof the scale--minus 25 to 25.Now, this is the\nreturn of the US stockmarket during that same\nperiod using that same scale--more risky.So you can see the\ndifference in fluctuations.And if this weren't\nexciting enough for you,this is Motorola.And there are many\nstocks like Motorola.So when you invest in\nan individual stock,you're getting not just the\nfluctuations of the economy,but you're getting\nthe fluctuations thataffect that specific company.So you should expect, if\nyou're taking on more risk,that you're going to be getting\na reward for these kindsof incredible bouncing around.And in fact, you do.The average return of\nMotorola is quite a bit higherthan that of the market.Now let me show you a little\nbit about predictability.We talked about a market\nthat's random as one thatis a good or efficient market.This plots the return\ntoday versus tomorrow,or yesterday versus today if\nyou want to think about that--pairs of returns for the\naggregate stock market.And this is done\non a daily basis.Now, if you look

days or two months,there's very little\npredictability.Now let me talk\nabout volatility.Your question?STUDENT: So on the last graph,\nGM is included in there, right?PROFESSOR: That's right.GM is one of the\nstocks in the S&P 500.STUDENT: So would you still\nsee that relationship if it waseverything but GM in the S&P?PROFESSOR: Oh, absolutely.In other words, it's\nnot any one stockthat gives this

rate you'regoing to get paid by\nthe US Government,versus over a one\nyear period whatis the interest rate you're\ngoing to get paid by the USGovernment?That's all.Now let me talk\nabout volatility.These are monthly estimates\nof US Stock Marketdaily volatility\nfrom 1926 to 1997.So every month I've\ngot 20 days or 21 days.I'm going to take\nthe daily returnsand calculate

annualized\nvolatility.But the point of this is that\nthere are periods of time wherethe market is\nextremely volatile,and there are periods of time\nwhere it's relatively quiet.And if I would have extended\nthis to the most recent period,you would see that within\nthe last several weekswe had a spike that was about\nas big as this spike over here.Anybody know what this spike is?You can sort of guess.Yeah, October 1987.That was the big stock\nmarket crash thatoccurred during that month.Volatility shot way up during\nthat month-- lots of risk.And right now we're\nin a situation wherethere is lots of risk as well.Now, I'm going to just\nconclude my overviewwith a few interesting anomalies\nthat I want to tease you withto get you to think\na little bit morecarefully about stock markets.What

you, for example,\nwhat this means here.This particular bin\nover here is the binof all stocks that\nhave the largest marketcapitalizations among all\nof the stocks in my sample.I've divided them up\ninto 10 equal groups.This is the largest\n10th, and I'mgoing to compute the\nreturns monthly for that binand then average that\nacross my entire sample.And I get an annual\nreturn of close to

seem to do\nbetter than large stocks.Now, there are lots of stories\nyou could tell about why.I'm not going to\ntell those stories,but I just want you\nto see the data.Now, you want to know\nwhat's weird about this?What's weird about\nthis picture isthat I'm going to change\nthe sample ever so slightly.What I'm going to\ndo is I'm goingto compute this graph only\nfor the month of Januaryand then

very small.But look at the January effect.That's big.And it turns out that this\nseems to be a phenomenon thathas become a little bit\nless pronounced recently,but for many years it was\nquite strong

to be aware of--and this, depending\non who you speak to,may not be considered\nan anomaly.For example, Warren\nBuffett wouldcall this genius and fact.This is the value premium.What this suggests is

with your portfolio,you are making a decision.So what we want to\ndo is to see if wecan think about making that\ndecision a little bit moresystematically.To do that, I want to define\nwhat I mean by a

securitieswhere the weights add up to one.Now, this is sort\nof the frameworkthat we use in terms\nof the notation.So omega, the\nGreek letter omega,when you write it\nas a vector, itdenotes the set

reason that this is an\ninteresting product is that--I have to give you a\nlittle bit of history.This is getting a\nlittle out of our area,but I'll give you a\npreview of Investments 433.Typically, when\ninstitutional investorslike pension funds or mutual\nfunds, when they invest,they are not allowed\nto short sell.This has nothing\nto do with the SEC.It has nothing to do with law.It has to do with the\nparticular entities thatare investing, because\nshort selling was viewed wayback as being a very risky\nendeavor because you could loseeverything and more.There's unlimited\namounts that youcould lose because your short\nselling a stock can go way upand you could lose\ntremendous amounts.So mutual funds\nwere originally notallowed to short sell at all.So for a mutual fund,\nthe portfolio weightswere restricted to\nbe non-negative,and certain pension funds were\nnot allowed to short sell.So if you were a pension\nplan or a state universityand you gave your money\nto investment manager xyz,that investment manager would\nbe required not to short sellfor your portfolio.", "start": 3240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "It was discovered over\nthe last several yearsthat this kind of\nconstraint artificiallydampened the return\nof a portfolio--not surprisingly, because\nwhen the market goes down,if you're long-only\nyou're going down with it.But if you have a\nshort position, thenat least the shorts would\nbe able to buffer someof the losses on the long side.So institutions have started\ngetting more and moresophisticated,\nthanks to hedge fundspushing them into this\narea because, of course,hedge funds can do anything.They can short, they can long,\nthey can go sideways, whatever.So hedge funds led\nthe pack by saying,we're going to\nactually short sellsome of your long-only\nportfolio to helpyou get a little bit of\nextra return on the downside.And so pretty soon,\ninstitutional investorssaid, well, I actually\nlike the idea of you shortselling a little bit but I don't\nwant you to do it too much.Because I don't really\nknow what the risks are.I'm new to this.I don't want to get the\nrisks out of control,so I'm going to limit how\nmuch you can short sell.The limit of how much\nyou can short sellimposes a limit on how much\nmore long you can go than 100%.Just like we said, if\nsomething's negative,then some of the weights have\ngot to be greater than one,or they got to add up\nto greater than one.So when you have\nthat situation whereyou have a limit on the total\nnegative position you can have,that limit puts a symmetric\nupper bound beyond the numberone of what you can go long.And so for reasons that are\nprobably a little bit too farafield to get into\nhere, 130-30 seemsto be a bit of a sweet spot\nfor managers out there.So they said, we will\nlimit our short positionsto no more than\n30% of the capital.So you give us $100\nmillion to manage,we will take no more than\n$30 million of shorts.And therefore, we will take\nno more than

portfolioand how you get those weights.That's pretty straightforward.Here's another example\nwhere you've nowgot some short positions\nhere, and the short positionsare not from short selling.But the short positions\nare in riskless bonds.In other words, now instead\nof shorting a stock,you're shorting a bond or\nselling a bond or borrowingmoney from a broker\nand getting leverage.So this is leverage where\nthe security that you'relevering up is using bonds,\nand you're levering upthe equity positions.So your portfolio\nweights look like this.Your equity positions,\nwhen you add up the

you\nget back 100%, or in this case,$50,000.So you start out\nwith $50,000 cashand then you buy\n$100,000 worth of stocksby borrowing an extra\n$50,000 from your broker.Yeah?STUDENT: I understand\nthe [? degree ?]of the portfolio [INAUDIBLE],\nbut I thought, fundamentally,it's to have different\nrisks and to manage that.PROFESSOR: Yes.STUDENT: So when\nyou are actuallystructuring portfolios, do

that.Stocks A, B, and C\nhave different risks,as does the bond.And so you're mixing and\nmatching and putting themtogether into what\nhopefully willbe an attractive portfolio.Now, we mentioned before\nthat when you get a mortgage,that's leverage, too.So this is an example\nof a situation whereyou buy a home for\n$500,000, but you onlyhave a $100,000 payment.Your equity in the\nhome is only $100,000.The bank has loaned\nyou $400,000.Your leverage ratio\nis 5:1, so if youwere to look at your\nportfolio weightsit would be 500% house minus\n400% bank or bonds or mortgage.That's very high leverage.And in that case, when\nyou're leveraged five to one,if the house price goes down by\nsomething like, I don't know,2%, you've lost 10% of\nthe value of your home--or the value of\nyour equity, rather.If the house price declines by\n15%, that's really bad news.So leverage is a\ntwo-edged sword.When things are working\nwell, it gives you a boost.When things are\nnot working well,",

that you\ndon't really knowhow to pick the right basket?And so therefore, whatever\nbasket you're watchingmay not be\nparticularly attractivebecause you picked\nthe wrong basket.So that's really the idea\nbehind portfolio theory.It's that not all of\nus are Warren Buffett.Not all of us want to\nbecome Warren Buffetts.We want to have a relatively\nsystematic approach to makinga good investment decision.We don't want to try\nto beat the market.We want to figure out\nwhether we can come upwith a responsible and\nattractive way of investingthat has some kind of\neconomic logic to it.So the point is that we don't\nknow which stock is best,and so we don't want to pick\njust one stock like Motorola.Because there are periods\nwhere Motorola looks fantasticand periods where\nMotorola looks

riskacross a number of securities,\nand portfolios can do that.But at the same time, they\ncan also create focused bets.So it's not just\nthe case that youhave to buy every possible stock\nthere is out there in orderto diversify.For example, you\nmay have informationor you may have conviction that\ninformation technology is goingto do really well over\nthe next couple of yearsbecause

make\na bet in an areawhere you think you have\nparticular expertise.And finally, portfolios\ncan customize and manageyour own personal\nrisk-reward tradeoffs.So for some of you,\nyou want a lot of

focus onfor purely statistical reasons.It's because those\nare easy to compute,and they are the\nfirst two statisticsthat one would\nlook at when you'relooking at an\ninvestment-- the meanand the standard deviation.So you might think that,\nnaturally, it would make senseto pick a portfolio\nthat's got high meanand low standard deviation.That's an assumption.In other words, we're\nassuming that we'regoing to measure risk\nby standard deviation,and we're assuming that\nwe're measuring returnby the actual expected\nrate of return.For certain investors,\nthose are not appropriate.For example, there\nare some investorsthat are really keen on\nsocially aware investingso they don't want to\ninvest in companiesthat pollute the environment.They don't want to\ninvest in companiesthat engage in nonunion\nworkers, or theydon't want to\ninvest in companiesthat happen to be exploiting\nlabor in unregulated markets.Those are examples of\nnon-pecuniary characteristicsthat figure into this\nchoice of stocks.We're going to\nabstract from that.So for our purposes, the\ncharacteristics that we'regoing to look at\nfor a good portfoliois, does it have a high\nreturn, does it have low risk?And the way we're\ngoing to measure riskis in terms of the volatility\nor standard deviation.Now, here, again, there's lots\nof ways of measuring risk.We can measure by the\nupper quartile, the 5% lossor spread, but in fact,\nwhat we're going to useis this standard\ndeviation measure.For symmetric distributions\nlike the normal,it turns out that that's\nnot a bad measure,but some people have argued\nthat by looking at spread", "start": 3960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "you're confusing the\nupside with the downside.Nobody has any problem\nwith upside risk or upsidedistribution.I haven't run across\nanybody that said, gee,this year I'm really\nmaking too much moneyand that's just\nnot a good thing.If you meet anybody\nlike that, introduce me.I'll help them out\nwith their problem.But the point is that for\na symmetric distribution,it doesn't matter, and in\nmore advanced approachesto investments people have\nused one-sided measures.But we're not going to\ndo that in this course.So we're going to focus on\nvariance or standard deviationas the measure of risk.And the assumptions\nthat I'm goingto make for the\nremainder of the courseis that all investors like\nhigher mean and all investorslike higher variance.Now, that's a really\nreasonable assumption,but you could\nchallenge it if youwanted to argue that investors\ncare about other things.So just be aware that I'm\nmaking an approximation,and the approximation is exactly\nthat, that mean and varianceare the only things that\nour prototypical investor isgoing to care about.So now, we actually are\npretty close to beingable to come up with an\nanswer to the question, what'sa good portfolio and\nhow do we pick stocks.One of the things that\nwe're going to answer overthe course of the\nnext few slidesis, how much does\na stock contributeto the risk and the expected\nreturn of a portfolio?So if you're thinking about\ninvesting in a new stock,it's like inviting\nsomebody into your club.You want to ask,\nwell, what are you", "start": 4080.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "going to contribute to my club?What are you going to\ncontribute to the portfolio?What will you add to\nwhat I already have?Are you going to help me\nwith my expected return?Are you going to help\nme lower my risk?And if the answer is no to both\nof them, then I don't want you.You're not going to\ndo anything for me.Why should you be\nin my portfolio?So that's the kind\nof argument we'regoing to make to be able to\nconstruct a good portfolio.So let's get a little bit\nmore specific about that.Here's a graph, and you're\ngoing to see this a lot.This graph is going\nto be one that we usefor all of portfolio analysis.It's where we plot on\ntwo-dimensional spacethe average return\nof the stock as wellas its risk, where\nrisk is now beingmeasured by standard deviation.So I've got five\nassets plotted here.Merck is one and General\nMotors is another one.Motorola is a third,\nMcDonald's a fourth,and I've got T-bills down\nthere on the lower left.This gives you a sense of the\ndifferent trade-offs there are.Clearly General Motors is\nlower risk that Motorola,but it's also lower return.And McDonald's is\ndefinitely goingto be higher risk than Merck,\nbut notice that McDonald's isalso lower return than Merck.So at least in this setting,\nnobody in their right mind--by that I mean, no\nrational investor--would ever want to hold\nMcDonald's over Merck--by our assumption.We're assuming that investors\nlike expected returnand they don't like risk.Question?Yeah?STUDENT: This [INAUDIBLE]\nthink that McDonald's willperform better.PROFESSOR: Exactly,\nthat's right.So I was waiting for\nsomebody to say that.", "start": 4200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Warren Buffett would\nsay that's the stupidestthing I've ever heard,\nbecause all you're doingis plotting history\non this chart.And this tells you nothing\nabout what might happenover the next 12, 24 months.It could be that health\ncare is going to just becomea real problem,\npharmaceutical companiesare going to get\nbattered becauseof the Democratic\nadministration.That's going to force\nthem to reduce the prices.And so over the next\nsix to 12 months,the only thing that\npeople will be able to dois to go to their neighborhood\nMcDonald's and just enjoya nice hamburger and\ncomplain about what'sbeen going on with the\npharmaceutical industry.In that case, McDonald's\nis a great betand Merck is a\nterrible investment.We abstract from all of that.We are not in the business\nof forecasting stock returns.Why?Because I just showed you\nin the previous set ofslides that it's\nhard to forecast.In fact, you told me that\nin an efficient marketit's actually hard\nto tell what's goingto happen with these stocks.And if you could\ntell, then peopleare going to start\nusing that information,and then the\ninformation is worthlessbecause it'll have already\nbeen taken into account.So you see, this\nis a very importantphilosophical difference between\nWarren Buffett and academics.Warren Buffett\nbelieves that thereare systematic mispricings\nout there that can befound and taken advantage of.Academic finance, as\nof the 1960s and 70swhen this theory was developed,\nstarted from the pointthat you just came\nto very quickly,which is that there are\nno patterns in the data.If there were, someone\nwould have already done it--which, by the way, Warren\nBuffett would answer by saying,you know what, that sounds\nlike a joke about the economistwalking down the road,\nsees a $100 bill,and walks right by it.And when somebody\nsays, why didn't youpick up the $100 bill, they\nsaid, well, if it were real,someone would have\nalready picked it up.I mean, that's the argument\nthat we made together.", "start": 4320.0, "heat": 0.1},

to\nargue with a $40-somethingbillionaire.I think that's his\nwealth, $40 billion.But that's not the\nperspective of this analysis.Mike?STUDENT: Well, let's say\nthe expected return wasyou had perfect\ninformation and that'swhat was going to be a\nperfect crystal ball.It would still be irrational\nto buy McDonald's versusMerck, so you'd short\nMcDonald's and long Merckuntil the returns became equal.PROFESSOR: Exactly.So I'm going to talk about\nthat for a little while,but you're right.So if you could short,\nthen what you'd want to dois exactly what you said.You want to basically long the\nlow risk, high yield asset,short the high risk, low\nyield asset, make that spread,and make it as\nriskless as you canbuy including other securities.Yes?STUDENT: Yeah, but\neventually it would collapse,and then the\nrelationship would--PROFESSOR: And then it should.That's right.So the argument that\neconomists would makeis that this picture is\nthe equilibrium of wherethese returns should be, given\nwhat the market determinestheir fair rates of return\nare, relative to their risks.So that's, again, a very big\nphilosophical difference.An economist would say,\nall of these securitiesare exactly where\nthey should be.And they may change over\ntime, but at any point in timethey are where they should be.Supply equals demand,\nmarket's clear,everything is equilibrium,\nand

you, this\nis a philosophical departurefrom what you're used\nto thinking and readingin the newspapers.Because the newspapers\nwould say, well,let's take a look at the\nearnings at McDonald's.Let's
