So the more peoplewith the threshold knowledge,\nthe more tests that are passed,and the more the course\nis passed by people.So the more photons coming\nin with that thresholdenergy, the

also be\nproblems on problems set tworelated to this topic.So photons-- also\ncalled light, alsocalled electric\nmagnetic radiation--may be described by their\nenergy, by their wavelength,or by their frequency.Whereas electrons, which\nare sometimes also calledphotoelectrons, may be described\nby their kinetic energy,their velocity, and, as you'll\nsee later, by their wavelength.So you'll be given\nproblems where,given different\npieces of information,you have to think about how\nyou're going to convert it.You've got to think about\nam I talking about a photon?Am I talking about an electron?And you also want to\nthink about units.You'll sometimes be\ntold about energy in eVsand sometimes be told\nabout energies in joules.So this is a conversion factor.All conversion factors are\ngiven to you on the exam.You do not need to memorize\nany kind of conversion factor.But you need to be\naware, when someonesaid joules, what's that a unit\nfor, or eV, what's that a unitfor.All right.So now we're going to do\nand in-class demonstrationof the photoelectric effect.But before we actually\ndo the experiment,we're going to predict what\nthe experiment will show.Always dangerous to\ndo that, so we'llhope it works after\nwe do the prediction.All right.So we're going to be\nlooking at whether we'regoing to get an injection of an\nelectron from a zinc surface.And we're given the

before we do the\nexperiment, let'sdo some calculations\nto see what we expect.So first, we want to\nsee what the energy,or calculate what the\nenergy, of the photonwill be that's a\nemitted by the UV lamp.And I will write this down.So what do we know?We know a bunch\nof things already.We know that energy is equal\nto Planck's constant timesthe frequency.We also know that the frequency\nis related to wavelengthby c, the speed of light.And then we can put\nthose two things togetherto say the energy, then, is\nalso the Planck's constant timesthe speed of light\ndivided by the wavelength.So we can use that last\nequation to do a calculation,and figure out the\nenergy that's associatedwith that particular\nwavelength of light.So here we have energy.We're going to write in Planck's\nconstant, 6.626 times 10to the minus 34.And the units are\njoules times secondsand the speed of\nlight, 2.998 times 10to the 8 meters per second.And we want to divide this,\nthen, by the wavelength.So we have

that the meters\nare going to cancel.The seconds cancel,\nand we're leftwith joules, which is good,\nbecause we want an energy.So joules is a\ngood thing to have.So there, we can do\na simple calculation.And we can look and say, OK,\nif the energy, then, associatedwith that wavelength\nis 7.82 times 10to the minus 19th joules, then\nwe ask, is this greater or lessthan the threshold

that should\nhave the energy that's needed.And so I will just write\nthese things down hereinstead of writing it again.So that was our UV.So now our red light, we have\n700 times 10 to the minus

photonsthat are emitted by\na laser in 60 secondsif you have an intensity\nof one milliwatt.And a milliwatt is equal\nto 10 to the minus 3 joulesper second.So we can just do that\ncalculation over

basically, when he charges\nthis, what's going to happenis that you have this plate,\nand you have this joint.And they're both going to\nbe electrically negative,because you've introduced\nsome electrons.And they're going\nto repel each other,because they're both negative.Two negative charges\nrepel each other.So you're going to see some\nspace develop as Eric's done.Now, what he's doing

really\namazing thing.This doesn't really\nshow up very well.It's a view of the Stata Center.Stata Center always has some\nreally spectacular sunlightcoming around it sometimes.All right.So now, if this is\ntrue, that meansthat photons that have\nthis quantized energyshould have momentum as well.And so Einstein was\nthinking about that.And so he reasoned that\nthis had to be true.There had to be some kind of\nmomentum associated with them.And so momentum, or p,\nhere is equal to Planck'sconstant times the frequency\ndivided by the speed of light,c.And since the speed of light\nis equal to the frequencytimes the wavelength\nof the light,then the momentum should be\nequal to Planck's constantdivided by the wavelength.So this is really-- we're\ntalking about momentumin terms of wavelength,

of masses.So this was really something.And this was basically\nhis PhD thesis.I think it maybe had\nmore pages than that,but this would have\nprobably been enough,this sort of cover page.This is my

think\nabout this a minute.And we can consider why,\nwhen you go to Fenway Park--and you should,\nbecause it's fun--and you watch someone\nthrow a fastball,why you don't see a wave\nassociated with that fastball.So we can consider a fastball\nand that the mass of a baseballis about 5 ounces,\nor 0.142 kilograms.And the velocity of a fastball\nis around 94 miles per hour,or 42 meters per

ball.And we can plug in these values.And here's Planck's\nconstant again.And now you'll note I did\nsomething with the units.So instead of joule\nseconds, I substitutedjoules with kilograms meters\nsquared seconds to the minus 2.And that's what's\nequal to a joule.And I'm going to do that so\nI can cancel out my units.And again, all of this will be\nprovided on an equation sheet.You do not need to remember\nall of these conversions.And so over the mass of the\nbaseball and the velocityof the baseball--\nand we're goingto put the velocity\nin meters per secondso our units can cancel

times 10 to the 34.And it is, in fact,\nundetectably small.OK.So now why don't you\ntry your hand at this,and we'll try a\nclicker question.Yeah, it's very tiny.All right.Let's take just 10 more

just realize the\nrelationship, the equation,involved.And so thinking about--\noops, I switched pointers.I like the green better.So think about the relationship\nbetween the velocityof the ball and the wavelength.And so Wakefield, who\nwas an knuckleballer,is the winner here, with\nthe longest wavelength.But still, the number\nfor this is 1.4 times 10to the minus 34.And so this is still\nundetectably small.So of course, no one had\nnoticed this property before.But it still, it still exists.So when you're talking\nabout a baseball,the wavelength is really\nnot very, relevant to you,because it is this incredibly\nsmall, undetectable number.But if you're talking\nabout an electron,it's entirely different.So now, if we think about a\ngaseous electron travelingat 4 times 10 to

share one with you.And this is a segment\nin their own words.So you're going to hear\nfrom Darcy, who was actuallya former TA for 5.111.So she is associated\nwith this class.She actually just got her\nPhD in the spring from MIT,and she now works at Google.But in this short,\nshe's going to tell youabout research in\nMoungi Bawendi's Lab,and why you should care\nabout quantum dots, whichare

number.So a particle this small has\nreally strange properties.Different things start to matter\nwhen you get really small.And just like an\natom, a quantum dot,or semiconductor nanocrystal,\nhas discrete energy levels.So if an electron is sitting\nat this energy level,and it absorbs\nlight, an electroncan get excited to a\nhigher energy level.And then, when that electron\nrelaxes back down to the groundstate, it emits light.And the energy of\nthat light is exactlythe difference between\nthese two energy levels.The difference between\nthe energy levelsis related to the\nsize of the dot.So in a really\nsmall quantum dot,the energy levels are far apart.So the light it emits\nis higher energy,because there's a large energy\ndifference between the energylevels.If we use a larger\nquantum dot, the distancebetween the energy levels is\nsmaller, so the light it emitsis lower energy, or redder.People in our lab are working\nto make quantum dots bindto a tumor.So when a doctor goes\nin to remove a tumor,they can see the shining\nof the UV light on it,and see whether\nit's all gone whenthey've taken out the tumor.They can also use quantum\ndots to label other thingsother than tumors,

like electrons,we need to consider the\nwavelike properties.It's really important when\nyou have a wavelength thatis so similar to the\nsize of the objectthat you're thinking about.So the Schrodinger\nequation reallybecame to quantum mechanics\nlike Newton's equationswere to classical mechanics.So what is the\nSchrodinger equation?So here's a picture\nof Schrodinger.And he looks so happy.I would be happy, too, if I\nhad come up with this equation,I think.So here's the simplest\nform of the equation", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.145}, {"text": "that you will probably ever see.And so we'll just define\nsome of these terms.So we have wave function, psi.And over here is\nthe binding energy,and that's the energy of binding\nan electron to a nucleus.And then an H with a hat, we\nhave our Hamiltonian operator.And in this course, you will\nnot be solving this equation.We're just going to be talking\nabout what sorts of thingscame out of this equation.So I'm going to give\nyou a little bit longerversion of the equation now.And so again, you're\nthinking about the electron.It has these\nwavelike properties.And it's somewhere in the atom,\nnot crashing into the nucleus.And it needs to be defined\nin three dimensions.And it has momentum,\nso it's moving.So we need to think about\nthis as an equation of motionin a three-dimensional space.And the equation\nis going to change.The math will change,\ndepending on wherethe electron is located,\nwhich you won't know exactly.So this is a very hard problem.But it's not totally\nwithout anythingto do with classical mechanics.And if we write\nthe longest versionyou'll see, at least in this\ncourse, for the hydrogen atom,I just want to show\nthis to point outthat there are some terms from\nclassical mechanics in here.This is Coulomb's energy,\nalso sometimes calledpotential energy.So we saw Coulomb's\nforce before.Here is Coulomb's energy.So some of the\nclassical mechanicsis contained within\nthis, but it expandsfrom classical\nmechanics to considerthe wavelike properties\nof the electrons.So whenever I talk\nabout this, I always", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.269}, {"text": "feel like I want to\nhave something betterto say about really what this\nis doing and where it came from.In terms of what it's doing,\nhow is solving this helping you?What are you learning\nfrom solving this?So one thing you're\nlearning from solvingthis is you're\nfinding E. And that'sreally important, the\nbinding energy of the nucleusand the electron.And we saw before\nthat, if you justused simple classical\nmechanics, youhave a positive and\nnegative charge thatare close to each other.Why don't they come and\ncrash into each other?We want to know how they are\nbonded to each other, what'sthe real energy of\nthat association.We also saw, with the\nphotoelectric effect,that it's not that\neasy to get an electronto eject from a metal surface.So it's bound in there.And what is that\nactual binding energy?So that comes out of the\nSchrodinger equation.This E here is the\nbinding energy.And also, solving it will tell\nyou about the wave functionor, as chemists\nlike to talk about,orbitals, where the electrons\nare, in what orbitals.So this is the\ninformation you get out.And importantly, it works.It matches experiment.So chemists are\nexperimentalists.We love experiments,\nand we see this data,and we want to understand it.And the Schrodinger equation\nhelps us understand it.It correctly predicts binding\nenergies and wave functions,and it explains why the hydrogen\natom is, in fact, stable,where you don't have crashing or\nexploding of the hydrogen atom.So where did this equation\ncome from that works so well?How did Schrodinger\ncome up with this?And this is always sort of\nthe puzzle when I teach this.I feel like I should have\nsomething profound to sayabout where this came from.And so I've done a little\nreading and looked,and I thought the best\nexplanation for thisthat I ever saw came\nfrom Richard Feynman.", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.354}, {"text": "And when he was asked\nhow Schrodinger came upwith this equation,\nhe said, \"it is notpossible to derive it\nfrom anything you know.It came out of the\nmind of Schrodinger.\"And I thought that\npretty much summed it up.So sometimes-- after\nclass last week,on Wednesday, someone\ncame down and said,you know, the\nThomson experiment,discovering the electron,\nwhy didn't someone elsedo that experiment?It seemed like it's\nnot a cathode ray.And you have to have a\nlittle phosphorous screen.Why didn't someone else\ndiscover the electron?And some of these other--\nde Broglie rearrangedsome equations, did it\nin a way that no one elsewas thinking, but still.Or plot solving the\nequation of a straight line.No one else was thinking\nabout it some way,using other people's data.They just sort of saw things in\ndata that other people didn't.But you think why didn't\nsomeone else see that, too?When it comes to the\nSchrodinger equation,the question is why didn't\nsomeone else or lots of peoplecome up with it?I think the question really\nis, how did Schrodingercome up with it?At least, that's\nthe question to me.And I have never really-- that's\nthe best explanation I have.It just came out of his mind.OK.So we're many years later.We've had the Schrodinger\nequation for a while.So this is an old story, right?Well, maybe for\nthe hydrogen atom,but this is still actually a\nvery active area of research.Oh, my startup disk is full.Thank you.Let's go back to that.All right.So I just thought--\nI always liketo give you examples of current\nresearch on these areas.And so I know a\nnumber of you wereinterested in potential of being\nchemical engineering majors,undergrads.And I'll tell you\nabout a new professorwho started about a\nyear ago, Heather Kulik.And her research group is\nreally interested in usinga quantum mechanical\napproach to study materialsand to study proteins.But when you get to\nthings like proteins,there's thousands and\nthousands of atoms around.Forget multiple electrons, we're\ntalking about multiple atoms", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.12}, {"text": "with multiple electrons,\nhuge complexes.How can you give a quantum\nmechanical analysisof things that are so large?And this is really important.I mean, I think that one of\nthe big problems moving forwardis solving the energy\nproblem and doing itin a way that doesn't\ndestroy our environment, sonew batteries, new\nelectrodes, new materials.We need to understand the\nproperties of different metalsto understand what will\nmake those good electrodes.And to really\nunderstand them, weneed a quantum\nmechanical approach.But these are big areas.There's a lot of things\nto consider here.So Heather is\ninterested in coming upwith improving algorithms,\nimproving the computation,to really give a quantum\nmechanical analysis to systemsthat have a lot\nof atoms in them.So if you're interested in\nthis area, you're not too late.You don't have to go\nback to the early 1900s.There's still a lot\nto do in this area.OK.So very briefly\nnow, let's just lookat the Schrodinger equation\nwe saw from the hydrogen atom.So we'll go back\nto understandingquantum mechanical analysis\nof photosynthesis-- amazing,don't understand how it works.That would be great if we did.That would really solve\na lot of energy problems.But we'll just go to hydrogen\natom, one electron back.So if you solve the\nSchrodinger equation for this--and I think I did this in\ncollege, not in freshman,chemistry, but somewhere\nalong the line--you'll come up with this term.So again, this is\nthe binding energy.We just want to know\nabout how the electron isbeing held by the nucleus.And there are some\nterms in here.We have the electrons\nmass-- that's known,the electrons charge.We have a permittivity\nconstant and Planck's constant.And if you look at this,\nyou go, wait a minute.That's a constant.That's a constant.That's a constant.That's a constant.We can simplify that.And we will.And that is the Rydberg's\nconstant, 2.18 times", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "10 to the minus 18th joules.So now it doesn't\nlook quite as scary.We can just substitute this RH.That makes us feel a lot better.It's one number that will be\ngiven on the equation sheet,so we don't even\nhave to remember it.And now we can rewrite this in\nterms of the binding energy.So again, the binding\nenergy, this is a constant.So now this turns into\nminus RH over n squared.And n, what is n?n is a positive integer\n1, 2, 3, up to infinity.And what's its name?What is n?You can you yell it out.Some of you know.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.The principle quantum\nnumber, that's right.So the principle\nquantum number comes outof the Schrodinger equation.And that's how we\ncan think about it.And again, here are these ideas.The binding energies\nare quantized.This is a constant over here.So the principle\nquantum number comes outof the Schrodinger equation.All right.So now, next time, we're\ngoing to think moreabout the Rydberg constant.And we're going to do a\ndemonstration next Fridayof the hydrogen atom spectrum\nto show that the Schrodingerequation, in fact, can\nexplain binding energies.So that's on Friday, and that's\nour first clicker competition.So come.Be ready with your clickers.You can sit in recitations.You can share answers\nbefore clicking in.It's not cheating.It's teamwork.OK.See you Friday.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.1}]
