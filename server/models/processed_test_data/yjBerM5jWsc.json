why not.That's in the column space.Those are independent and\nI've got the number right,I've got two.Actually, this is a key point.If you know the dimension of\nthe space you're working with,and we know that this column\n-- we know that the dimension,DIM, the dimension of\nthe column space is two.If you know the\ndimension, then --and we have a couple of\nvectors that are independent,they'll automatically be abasis.If we've got the number\nof vectors right,two vectors in this case,\nthen if they're independent,they can't help\nbut span the space.Because if they\ndidn't span the space,there'd be a third guy\nto help span the space,but it couldn't be independent.So, it just has\nto be independentif we've got the numbers right.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.153}, {"text": "And they span.OK.Very good.So you got the\ndimension of a space.So this was another basis\nthat I just invented.OK.Now, now I get to ask\nabout the null space.What's the dimension\nof the null space?So we, we got a\ngreat fact there,the dimension of the\ncolumn space is the rank.Now I want to ask you\nabout the null space.That's the other\npart of the lecture,and it'll go on to\nthe next lecture.OK.So we know the dimension of the\ncolumn space is two, the rank.What about the null space?This is a vector\nin the null space.Are there other vectors\nin the null space?Yes or no?Yes.So this isn't a basis because\nit's doesn't span, right?There's more in the null\nspace than we've got so far.I need another vector at least.So tell me another\nvector in the null space.Well, the natural choice, the\nchoice you naturally think ofis I'm going on to\nthe fourth column,I'm letting that free\nvariable be a one,and that free variable\nbe a zero, and I'm askingis that fourth\ncolumn a combinationof my pivot columns?Yes, it is.And it's -- that will do.So what I've written\nthere are actually the twospecial solutions, right?I took the two free\nvariables, free and free.I gave them the values 1 0\nor 0 I figured out the rest.So do you see, let me\njust say it in words.This vector, these vectors in\nthe null space are telling me,they're telling me\nthe combinations", "start":

that those questions\njust keep coming up all thetime.Are they a basis\nfor the null space?You can tell me the answer\neven though we haven'twritten out a proof of that.Can you?Yes or no?Do these two special\nsolutions forma basis for the null space?In other words,\ndoes the null spaceconsist of all combinations\nof those two guys?Yes or no?Yes.Yes.The null space is\ntwo dimensional.The null space, the\ndimension of the null space,is the number of free variables.So the dimension\nof the null spaceis the number of free variables.And at the last second,\ngive me the formula.This is then the key\nformula that we know.How many free variables are\nthere in terms of R, the rank,m -- the number of rows,\nn, the number of columns?What do we get?We have n columns, r of\nthem are pivot
