[{"text": "PROFESSOR ROBERT DORKIN:Hi, and\nwelcome to a help sessionon recombinant DNA.Today we will be talking about\nthe polymerase chain reactionas well as DNA sequencing.The polymerase chain reaction,\nalso known asPCR, has many uses.One of the most common\nuses is to amplify adesired section of DNA.What you need for the reaction\nis your DNA sequence ofinterest, DNA polymerase, DNA\nprimers, and then fourdifferent nucleotides.You combine all these together,\nand the first thingthat you do is you heat\nthe reaction up.What this does is that by adding\nheat to the system, youbreak the hydrogen bonds\nbetween the twodifferent DNA strands.This results in two separate\nDNA sequences.Now what happens is that you\nallow the system to cool.As it cools, the DNA primers are\nable to hybridize to thisseparate strands.Now as you remember from\nlecture, when you'resynthesizing DNA, you synthesize\nfrom the five primeto three prime direction.This means that the primers you\ndesign have to match thethree prime end of your\nsequences of interest.So for example, if we were\ndesigning primers for thesetwo sequences, one of them would\nbe GGTA and the otherone would be AGCT.Now, I've written four here.In actuality, these primers are\ngenerally longer, around", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.232}, {"text": "16 or so, 16 to 27.However, they can be a whole\ndifferent variety of lengthsdependent on numerous\ndifferent factors.The next thing that happens is\nthat the DNA polymerase isgoing to bind to the DNA\nsequence with the primer.Once the DNA polymerase is\nbound, it's going to take someof the free nucleotides in the\nsurrounding area and slowlyadd them to finish\nup the strand.And so on and so forth.Once it's completed, we are\ngoing to have now doubled ouroriginal DNA sequence.We're going to have two strands\nthat are identical tothe first one.As you can see, by repeating\nthe steps, heating it,allowing it to cool, allowing\nmore primers to bond, and thenallowing the DNA polymerase to\nelongate, we can double thenumber of sequences\nevery round.And you can rapidly\nget a large amountof the desired sequence.PCR has other uses though\nbesides simply increasing thetotal amount of DNA\nthat you have.One of the uses of PCR\nis to sequence DNA.Now, if we look over here,\nnormally DNA is form ofdeoxyribonucleic acids.You have the phosphate group\non the five prime end.You have a hydroxyl group\non the three prime end.This hydroxyl group\nis very important.That's because when a new\nnucleotide is added, thishydroxyl group undergoes a\ncovalent bond with thephosphate on the new nucleotide\nand then adds a newnucleotide that way.So you can see you're adding\nthe five prime", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.344}, {"text": "the three prime direction.However, it is possible\nto create adideoxyribonucleic acid.The dideoxyribonucleic acid,\ninstead of having a threeprime hydroxyl group, has\na three prime hydrogen.This three prime hydrogen is no\nlonger capable of forming acovalent bond with\na phosphate.That means as soon as the\ndideoxyribonucleic acid isadded to DNA, no further\nnucleotides can be added inthe series.Let's go back to our example\nwith the primers.What does that mean for here?Well, let's say you have a\nnormal PCR reaction, but inaddition to the four\ndeoxyribonucleic acids youhave, you also take a little\nbit of dideoxyribonucleicacids of one of the types.So let's say we add\nin some ddTTP.Now what happens is that your\nDNA polymerase will go alongadding nucleotides as normal,\nbut if it ever adds adideoxyribonucleic acid, the\npolymerase will stop.So if it adds, say\na normal T here--continues down, continues\ndown.If it adds a dideoxyribonucleic\nacid here,it's going to stop,\nand we're going toget a truncated sequence.And so you can see that at any\nposition that we have an A,it's going to be possible to\nhave a truncated sequence ofthat length.What this means that we're now\ngoing to, once the PCR iscomplete, have different DNA\nsequences of numerousdifferent lengths.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.457}, {"text": "But the one thing they're all\ngoing to have in common isthat they're all going to end\nwith a T. So you can imaginedoing this now for each of the\nfour different letters.Then we can take them and\nrun them out of a gel.Let's go look at such\na gel over here.Here we have a gel.Each of these letters\nrepresents whichdideoxyribonucleic acid was\nused for that experiment.And then the PCR was\nrun out on the gel.As you remember, the strands\nclose to the bottom are theshorter strands, and the strands\nclose to the top arethe longer strands.So if we look at this gel, we\nknow that the shortest strandends with a G. The next shortest\nstrand ends in a T.Oh, sorry, ends in\nan A, excuse me.Then the next short strand ends\nin a T, then two A's,then a G, then a C, then a T. So\nas you can see, this is oneway to determine the\nsequence of DNA.Another way has been devised,\nwhich is even faster.Instead of running the sequences\nall out in differentpolymerase chain reactions, what\nthey do is they have someof each of the\ndideoxynucleotides together.But now, they fluorescently\nlabel them, such that you havea different fluorescent\nlabel on eachdideoxyribonucleic acid.Now what happens is that\nyou can run it", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.61}, {"text": "out all on one column.And then by just looking at the\ncolors, you can determinewhat the sequence is.So once again, the sequence\nwould be GATAAGCT.And so this way, you can more\nefficiently, more rapidly,determine what the\nDNA sequence is.This has been two examples of\npolymerase chain reactions andtheir uses.This has been another help\nsession on recombinant DNA.We hope you join us\nagain next time.Thank you.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.816}]
