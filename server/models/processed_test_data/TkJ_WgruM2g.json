basic\nexperimental factsthat we will both\nhave to deal withand that our aim should\nbe to understand and modelthrough the rest of the course.Physics doesn't tell\nyou some abstract truthabout why the universe\nis the way it is.Physics gives you\nmodels to understandhow things work and predict\nwhat will happen next.And what we will\nbe aiming to do isdevelop models that give us\nan intuition for the phenomenaand allow us to\nmake predictions.And these are going to be the\nexperimental facts I would liketo both explain, develop\nan intuition for, and beable to predict consequences of.So we'll start off with--\nso let me just outline them.So, first fact, atoms exist.I'll go over some of\nthe arguments for that.Randomness, definitely\npresent in the world.Atomic spectre are\ndiscrete and structured.We have a photoelectric\neffect, whichI'll describe in some detail.Electrons do some funny things.In particular\nelectron diffraction.And sixth and finally,\nBell's Inequality.Something that we will come\nback to at the very endof the class, which\nI like to thinkof as a sort of a frame\nfor the entirety of 804.So everyone in here\nknows that atomsare made of\nelectrons and nuclei.In particular, you\nknow that electronsexist because you've\nseen a cathode ray tube.I used to be able to\nsay you've seen a TV,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.946}, {"text": "but you all have flat panel\nTVs, so this is useless.So a cathode ray tube is a\ngun that shoots electronsat a phosphorescent screen.And every time the\nelectron hits the screenit induces a little\nphosphorescence, a little glow.And that's how you see on a CRT.And so as was pithily\nstated long agoby a very famous physicist, if\nyou can spray them, they exist.Pretty good argument.There's a better argument for\nthe existence of electrons,which is that we can actually\nsee them individually.And this is one of\nthe most famous imagesin high-energy physics.It's from an experiment\ncalled Gargamelle,which was a 30-cubic meter tank\nof liquid freon pulsing justat its vapor pressure\n60 times a second.And what this image is is,\napart from all the schmut,you're watching a\ntrail of bubblesin this de-pressurizing freon\nthat wants to create bubblesbut you have to\nnucleate bubbles.What you're seeing there\nin that central line thatgoes up and then curls\naround is a single electronthat was nailed by a neutrino\nincident from a beam at CERNwhere currently\nthe LHC is running.And this experiment\nrevealed two things.First, to us it\nwill reveal that youcan see individual electrons and\nby studying the images of themmoving through\nfluids and leavinga disturbing wake of\nbubbles behind them.We can study their properties\nin some considerable detail.The second thing it taught us\nis something new-- we're notgoing to talk about\nit in detail--is that it's possible for a\nneutrino to hit an electron.And that process is called\na weak neutral currentfor sort of stupid\nhistorical reasons.It's actually a\nreally good name.And that was awesome\nand surprisingand so this picture\nis both a monumentto the technology\nof the experiment,but also to the physics of weak\nneutral currents and electrons.They exist if you can discover\nneutrinos by watching them.OK.Secondly, nuclei.We know that nuclei\nexist because youcan shoot alpha particles, which\ncome from radioactive decay,at atoms.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.708}, {"text": "And you have your atom which\nis some sort of vague thing,and I'm gonna make\nthe-- I'm gonnafind the atom by making\na sheet of atoms.Maybe a foil.A very thin foil of stuff.And then I'm gonna shoot\nvery high-energy alphaparticles incident of this.Probably everyone has\nheard of this experiment,it was done by Rutherford\nand Geiger and Marsden,in particular his students\nat the time or post-docs.I don't recall-- and you shoot\nthese alpha particles in.And if you think of these guys\nas some sort of jelly-ish lumpthen maybe they'll\ndeflect a little bit,but if you shoot a\nbullet through Jelloit just sort of maybe gets\ndeflected a little bit.But Jello, I mean, come on.And I think what was\nshocking is that you shouldthese alpha particles in\nand every once in a while,they bounce back at, you\nknow, 180, 160 degrees.Rutherford likened this\nto rolling a bowlingball against a piece of paper\nand having it bounce back.Kind of surprising.And the explanation here that\npeople eventually came up uponis that atoms are\nmostly zero density.Except they have very,\nvery high densitycores, which are\nmany times smallerthan the size of the atom\nbut where most of the massis concentrated.And as a consequence,\nmost of the inertia.And so we know that\natoms have substructure,and the picture we have\nis that well if you scrapethis pile of metal, you can\npull off the electrons, leavingbehind nuclei which have\npositive charge because you'vescraped off the electrons\nthat have negative charge.So we have a picture\nfrom these experimentsthat there are\nelectrons and thereare nuclei-- which, I'll\njust write N and plus-- whichare the constituents of atoms.Now this leads to a very natural\npicture of what an atom is.If you're a 19th-century\nphysicist, or evenan early 20th-century\nphysicist, it's very naturalto say, aha, well if I know\nif I have a positive chargeand I have a\nnegative charge, thenthey attract each other with\na 1 over r minus q1 q2--sorry, q1 q2 over r potential.This is just like\ngravity, right.The earth and the\nsun are attractedwith an inverse-r potential.This leads to Keplerian orbits.And so maybe an atom\nis just some sortof orbiting\nclassical combinationof an electron and a nucleus,\npositively charged nucleus.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.789}, {"text": "The problem with\nthis picture, as youexplore in detail in your first\nproblem on the problem set,is that it doesn't work.What happens when you\naccelerate a charge?It radiates.Exactly.So if it's radiating,\nit's gotta lose energy.It's dumping energy into\nthis-- out of the system.So it's gotta fall lower\ninto the potential.Well it falls\nlower, it speeds up.It radiates more.Because it's accelerating more\nto stay in a circular orbit.All right, it radiates more,\nit has to fall further down.So on the problem\nset you're goingto calculate how\nlong that takes.And it's not very long.And so the fact that we persist\nfor more than a few picosecondstells you that it's\nnot that-- this is nota correct picture of an atom.OK.So in classical mechanics,\natoms could not exist.And yet, atoms exist.So we have to explain that.That's gonna be our\nfirst challenge.Now interestingly Geiger\nwho is this collaboratorof Rutherford, a young junior\ncollaborator of Rutherford,went on to develop a\nreally neat instrument.So suppose you want\nto see radiation.We do this all the time.I'm looking at you and I'm\nseeing radiation, seeing light.But I'm not seeing ultra\nhigh energy radiation,I'm seeing energy radiation\nin the electromagnetic wavesin the optical spectrum.Meanwhile I'm also not\nseeing alpha particles.So what Geiger wanted\nwas a way to detectwithout using your eyes\nradiation that's hard to see.So the way he did this\nis he took a capacitorand he filled the--\nsurrounded the capacitorwith some noble gas.It doesn't interact.There's no-- it's\nvery hard to ionize.And if you crank up the\npotential across this capacitorplate high enough,\nwhat do you get?A spark.You all know this, if you crank\nup a capacitor it eventuallybreaks down because the\ndielectric in betweenbreaks down, you get a\nspontaneous sparking.So what do you\nfigure it would lookif I take a capacitor\nplate and I charge it up,but not quite to breakdown.Just a good potential.And another charged particle\ncomes flying through,like an alpha particle, which\ncarries a charge of plus 2,that positive charge\nwill disturb things", "start": 360.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "and will add extra\nfield effectively.And lead to the\nnucleation of a spark.So the presence of a spark\nwhen this potential is notstrong enough to induce\na spark spontaneouslyindicates the passage\nof a charged particle.Geiger worked later\nwith-- Marsden?Muller.Heck.I don't even remember.And developed this\ninto a device now knownas the Geiger counter.And so you've probably all\nseen or heard Geiger countersgoing off in movies, right.They go ping ping ping ping\nping ping ping ping ping, right.They bounce off randomly.This is an extremely\nimportant lesson,which is tantamount to the\nlesson of our second experimentyesterday.The 50-50, when we\ndidn't expect it.The white electrons\ninto the harness boxthen into a color box\nagain, would come out50-50, not 100 percent.And they come out in a\nway that's unpredictable.We have no ability\nto our knowledge--and more than our\nknowledge, we'llcome back to that with\nBell's Inequality--but we have no ability to\npredict which electron willcome out of that third\nbox, white or black, right.Similarly with a Geiger counter\nyou hear that atoms decay,but they decay randomly.The radiation comes out of a\npile of radioactive materialtotally at random.We know the probabilistic\ndescription of that.We're going to develop that,\nbut we don't know exactly when.And that's a really\npowerful example--both of those experiments\nare powerful examplesof randomness.And so we're going to\nhave to incorporate thatinto our laws of physics into\nour model of quantum phenomenaas well.Questions?I usually have a Geiger\ncounter at this point, whichis totally awesome, so I'll try\nto produce the Geiger counterdemo later.But the person with\nthe Geiger counterturns out to have\nleft the continent,so made it a little challenging.OK.Just sort of since we're at\nMIT, an interesting side note.This strategy of\nso-called hard scattering,of taking some\nobject and sending itat very high velocity\nat some other objectand looking for the rare\nevents when they bounce offat some large angle,\nso-called hard scattering.Which is used to detect\ndense cores of objects.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.78}, {"text": "It didn't stop with Rutherford.People didn't just\ngive up at that point.Similar experience\nin the '60s and '70swhich are conducted\nat Slack, wereinvolved not alpha\nparticles incidenton atoms but individual\nelectrons incident on protons.So not shooting into the\nnucleus, but shootingand looking for the effect\nof hitting individual protonsinside the nucleus.And through this process it\nwas discovered that in fact--so this was done in the '60s and\n'70s, that in fact the protonitself is also not a\nfundamental particle.The proton is itself composite.And in particular, it's made\nout of-- eventually peopleunderstood that it's made\nout of, morally speaking,and I'm gonna put this\nin quotation marks--ask me about it\nin office hours--three quarks, which\nare some particles.And the reason\nwe-- all this tellsyou is that it's some object and\nwe've given it the name quark.But indeed there are\nthree point-like particlesthat in some sense\nmake up a proton.It's actually much more\ncomplicated than that,but these quarks,\namong other things,have very strange properties.Like they have\nfractional charge.And this was discovered by\na large group of people,in particular led by Kendall\nand Friedman and alsoRichard Taylor.Kendall and Friedman\nwere at MIT,Richard Taylor was at Stanford.And in 1990 they\nshared the Nobel Prizefor the discovery of the\npartonic structure outof the nucleons.So these sorts of\ntechniques that peoplehave been using for\na very long timecontinue to be\nuseful and awesome.And in particular\nthe experiment,the experimental version of\nthis that's currently going on,that I particularly\nlove is somethingcalled the\nrelativistic heavy ioncollider, which is\ngoing on at Brookhaven.So here what you're doing is you\ntake two protons and you blowthem into each other\nat ultra high energy.Two protons, collide them\nand see what happens.And that's what happens.You get massive shrapnel\ncoming flying out.So instead of having a simple\nthing where one of the protonsjust bounces because there's\nsome hard quark, instead whathappens is just shrapnel\neverywhere, right.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.495}, {"text": "So you might think, well, how\ndo we interpret that at all.How do you make sense out of\n14,000 particles coming outof two protons bouncing\ninto each other.How does that make any sense?And the answer turns out\nto be kind of awesome.And so this touches\non my research.So I want to make a quick\ncomment on it just for color.The answer turns out to\nbe really interesting.First off, the interior\nconstituents of protonsinteract very strongly\nwith each other.But at the brief moment\nwhen protons collidewith each other, what\nyou actually formis not a point-like quirk\nand another point-like quark.In fact, protons aren't made\nout of point-like quarks at all.Protons are big bags\nwith quarks and gluonsand all sorts of particles\nfluctuating in and outof existence in a\ncomplicated fashion.And what you actually get\nis, amazingly, a liquid.For a brief, brief\nmoment of timethe parts of those\nprotons that overlap--think of them as\ntwo spheres and theyoverlap in some sort of\nalmond-shaped region.The parts of those\nprotons that overlapform a liquid at\nultra high temperatureand at ultra high density.It's called the RHIC fireball\nor the quark-gluon plasma,although it's not\nactually a plasma.But it's a liquid like water.And what I mean by saying\nit's a liquid like water,if you push it, it\nspreads in waves.And like water,\nit's dissipative.Those waves dissipate.But it's a really\nfunny bit of liquid.Imagine you take\nyour cup of coffee.You drink it, you're drinking\nyour coffee as I am wont to do,and it cools down over time.This is very frustrating.So you pour in a little\nbit of hot coffeeand when you pour\nin that hot coffee,the system is out\nof equilibrium.It hasn't thermalized.So what you want is you want\nto wait for all of the systemto wait until it's come to\nequilibrium so you don'tget a swig of hot\nor swig of cold.You want some sort of\nGoldilocks-ean in between.So you can ask how long\ndoes it take for this coffeeto come to thermal equilibrium.Well it takes a while.You know, a few\nseconds, a few minutes,depending on exactly\nhow you mess with it.But let me ask you\na quick question.How does that time scale\ncompare to the timeit takes for light\nto cross your mug?Much, much, much slower, right?By orders of magnitude.For this liquid that's formed\nin the ultra high energy", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.548}, {"text": "collision of two\nprotons, the time ittakes for the system--\nwhich starts outcrazy out of equilibrium\nwith all sorts of quarkshere and gluons there\nand stuff flyingabout-- the time it takes for it\nto come to thermal equilibriumis of order the time\nit takes for lightto cross the little\npuddle of liquid.This is a crazy liquid, it's\ncalled a quantum liquid.And it has all sorts of\nwonderful properties.And the best thing\nabout it to my mindis that it's very well\nmodeled by black holes.Which is totally separate\nissue, but it's a fun example.So from these sorts\nof collisions,we know a great deal\nabout the existenceof atoms and randomness,\nas you can see.That's a fairly random sorting.OK so moving on to\nmore 804 things.Back to atoms.So let's look at\nspecifics of that.I'm not kidding, they really\nare related to black holes.I get paid for this.So here's a nice fact, so\nlet's get to atomic spectra.So to study atomic\nspectra, here'sthe experiment I want to run.The experiment I want\nto run starts outwith some sort of power plant.And out of the power\nplant come two wires.And I'm going to run these wires\nacross a spark gap, you know,a piece of metal here,\na piece of metal here,and put them inside a\ncontainer, which has some gas.Like H2 or neon or\nwhatever you want.But some simple gas inside here.So we've got an\nelectric potentialestablished across it.Again, we don't want so much\npotential that it sparks,but we do want to excite the H2.So we can even make it spark, it\ndoesn't really matter too much.The important\nthing is that we'regoing to excite the hydrogen,\nand in exciting the hydrogenthe excited hydrogen is\ngoing to send out light.And then I'm going to take\nthis light-- we take the light,and I'm gonna shine this\non a prism, somethingI was taught to do by Newton.And-- metaphorically\nspeaking-- and look", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.853}, {"text": "at the image of\nthis light havingpassed through the prism.And what you find is you find a\nvery distinct set of patterns.You do not get a\ncontinuous band.In fact what you get-- I'm going\nto have a hard time drawingthis so let me draw down here.I'm now going to draw the\nintensity of the light incidenton the screen on this piece\nof paper-- people really usedto use pieces of\npaper for this, whichis kind of awesome-- as a\nfunction of the wavelength,and I'll measure\nit in angstroms.And what you\ndiscover is-- here'saround 1,000 angstroms--\nyou get a bunch of lines.Get these spikes.And they start to spread out,\nand then there aren't so many.And then at around 3,000,\nyou get another set.And then at around 10,000,\nyou get another set.This is around 10,000.And here's the interesting\nthing about these.So the discovery\nof these lines--these are named after a guy\nnamed Lyman, these are-- theseare named after a\nguy named-- Ballmer.Thank you.Steve Ballmer.And these are passion,\nlike passion fruit.So.Everyone needs a mnemonic, OK.And so these people\nidentified these linesand explained various\nthings about them.But here's an interesting fact.If you replace this nuclear\npower plant with a coal plant,it makes no difference.If you replace this prism\nby a different prism,it makes no difference\nto where the lines are.If you change this mechanism\nof exciting the hydrogen,it makes no difference.As long as it's hydrogen-- as\nlong as it's hydrogen in hereyou get the same lines, mainly\nwith different intensitiesdepending upon how exactly\nyou do the experiment.But you get the same\nposition of the lines.And that's a really\nstriking thing.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.793}, {"text": "Now if you use a different\nchemical, a different gasin here, like neon, you get a\nvery different set of lines.And a very different\neffective colornow when you eyeball this thing.So Ballmer,\nincidentally-- and I thinkthis is actually\nwhy he got blamedfor that particular series,\nalthough I don't knowthe history-- Ballmer noticed\nby being-- depending on whichbiography you read-- very\nclever or very obsessedthat these guys, this particular\nset, could be-- they'rewavelengths.If you wrote their\nwavelengths and labeled themby an integer n,\nwhere n ran from 3to any positive integer above\n3, could be written as 36.So this is pure numerology.36, 46 angstroms times\nthe function n squaredover n squared minus 4,\nwhere N is equal to 3, 4,dot dot dot-- an integer.And it turns out if you\njust plug in these integers,you get a pretty\ngood approximationto this series of lines.This is a hallowed\ntradition, a phenomenologicalfit to some data.Where did it come from?It came from his creative\nor obsessed mind.So this was Ballmer.And this is specifically\nfor hydrogen gas, H2.So Rydberg and Ritz, R and\nR, said, well actually wecan do one better.Now that they realized\nthat this is true,they looked at the\nwhole sequence.And they found a really\nneat little expression,which is that 1\nover the wavelengthis equal to a single\nconstant parameter.Not just for all these,\nbut for all of them.One single numerical coefficient\ntimes 1 over m squared minus 1over n squared-- n is an\ninteger greater than zeroand greater in\nparticular than m.And if you plug in any value\nof n and any value of m,for sufficiently\nreasonable-- I mean,if you put in 10\nmillion integersyou're not going to see it\nbecause it's way out there,but if you put in\nor-- rather, in here--if you put any value\nof n and m, youwill get one of these lines.So again, why?You know, as it's\nsaid, who ordered that.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.909}, {"text": "So this is experimental\nresult threethat we're going to\nhave to deal with.When you look at atoms and you\nlook at the specter of lightcoming off of them, their\nspectra are discrete.But they're not just\nstupidly discrete, they'rediscrete with real structure.Something that begs\nfor an explanation.This is obviously\nmore than numerology,because it explains with\none tunable coefficienta tremendous number\nof spectral lines.And there's a difference--\nand crucially, these bothwork specifically for hydrogen.For different atoms you need\na totally different formula.But again, there's\nalways some formulathat nails those spectral lines.Why?Questions?OK.So speaking of atomic\nspectra-- whoops,I went one too far-- here's\na different experiment.So people notice\nthe following thing.People notice that if\nyou take a piece of metaland you shine a light\nat it, by taking the sunor better yet, you know,\nthese days we'd use a laser,but you shine light on\nthis piece of metal.Something that is done all the\ntime in condensed matter labs,it's a very useful technique.We really do use\nlasers not the sun,but still it continues to be\nuseful in fact to this day.You shine light on a piece of\nmetal and every once in a whilewhat happens is electrons\ncome flying off.And the more light and the\nstronger the light you shine,you see changes in the way\nthat electrons bounce off.So we'd like to measure that.I'd like to make that precise.And this was done in a\nreally lovely experiment.Here's the experiment.The basic idea of the experiment\nis I want to check to see,as I change the features of\nthe light, the intensity,the frequency, whatever, I\nwant to see how that changesthe properties of the\nelectrons that bounce off.Now one obvious way--\none obvious featureof an electron that flew\noff a piece of metalis how fast is it going, how\nmuch energy does it have.What's its kinetic energy.So I'd like to build\nan experiment thatmeasures the kinetic energy\nof an electron that's", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.796}, {"text": "been excited through this\nphotoelectric effect.Through emission after shining\nlight on a piece of metal.Cool?So I want to build\nthat experiment.So here's how that\nexperiment goes.Well if this electron\ncomes flying offwith some kinetic\nenergy and I wantto measure that kinetic energy,\nimagine the following circuit.OK first off imagine I just\ntake a second piece of metalover here, and I'm going to put\na little current meter here,an ammeter.And here's what\nthis circuit does.When you shine light on\nthis piece of metal--we'll put a screen to protect\nthe other piece of metal--the electrons come flying\noff, they get over here.And now I've got a bunch of\nextra electrons over hereand I'm missing\nelectrons over here.So this is negative,\nthis is positive.And the electrons will\nnot flow along this wireback here to\nneutralize the system.The more light I shine,\nthe more electronswill go through this circuit.And as a consequence, there\nwill be a current runningthrough this current meter.That cool with everyone?OK.So we haven't yet measured\nthe kinetic energy, though.How do we measure\nthe kinetic energy?I want to know how much\nenergy, with how much energy,were these electrons ejected.Well I can do that by the\nfollowing clever trick.I'm going to put now\na voltage source here,which I can tune the voltage\nof, with the voltage V.And what that's going to do is\nset up a potential differenceacross these and\nthe energy in thatis the charge times the\npotential difference.So I know that the potential\ndifference it takes,so the amount of energy\nit takes to overcomethis potential difference,\nis q times V. That cool?So now imagine I send in an\nelectron-- I send in lightand it leads an\nelectron to jump across,and it has kinetic energy, kE.Well if the kinetic\nenergy is less than this,will it get across?Not so much.It'll just fall back.But if the kinetic energy\nis greater than the energyit takes to cross, it'll\ncross and induce a current.So the upshot is that, as a\nfunction of the voltage, whatI should see is that there is\nsome critical minimum voltage.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.477}, {"text": "And depending on how\nyou set up the sign,the sign could be the\nother way, but there'ssome critical minimal voltage\nwhere, for less voltage,the electron doesn't get across.And for any greater\nvoltage-- or, sorry,for any closer to zero\nvoltage, the electronhas enough kinetic\nenergy to get across.And so the current\nshould increase.So there's a critical\nvoltage, V-critical,where the current running\nthrough the systemruns to zero.You make it harder\nfor the electronsby making the voltage in\nmagnitude even larger.You make it harder for the\nelectrons to get across.None will get across.Make it a little easier, more\nand more will get across.And the current will go up.So what you want to do to\nmeasure this kinetic energyis you want to measure\nthe critical voltageat which the current\ngoes to zero.So now the question is\nwhat do we expect to see.And remember that things we\ncan tune in this experimentare the intensity\nof the light, whichis like e squared\nplus b squared.And we can tune the\nfrequency of the light.We can vary that.Now does the total energy,\ndoes that frequencyshow up in the total energy of a\nclassical electromagnetic wave?No.If it's an electromagnetic\nwave, it cancels out.You just get the\ntotal intensity,which is a square of the fields.So this is just like\na harmonic oscillator.The energy is in the amplitude.The frequency of the\noscillator doesn't matter.You push the swing harder,\nit gets more kinetic energy.It's got more energy.OK.So what do we expect\nto see as we vary,for example, the intensity?So here's a natural gas.If you take-- so you can\nthink about the light hereas getting a person literally,\nlike get the person next to youto take a bat and\nhit a piece of metal.If they hit it really\nlightly they'reprobably not going to excite\nelectrons with a lot of energy.If they just whack\nthe heck out of it,", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.435}, {"text": "then it wouldn't\nbe too surprisingif you get much more energy\nin the particles thatcome flying off.Hit it hard enough,\nthings are justgonna shrapnel and disintegrate.The expectation here\nis the following.That if you have a\nmore intense beam,then you should get more--\nthe electrons coming offshould be more energetic.Because you're\nhitting them harder.And remember that\nthe potential, whichI will call V0, the\nstopping voltage.So therefore V0 should\nbe greater in magnitude.So this anticipates\nthat the way this curveshould look as we vary the\ncurrent as a function of v,if we have a low voltage--\nsorry, if we havea low-intensity beam-- it\nshouldn't take too muchpotential just to\nimpede the

high-intensity\nbeam you're justwhacking those\nelectrons really hardand they're coming off with\na lot of kinetic energy.So this is high intensity.Everyone down with\nthat intuition?This is what you get from\nMaxwell's electrodynamics.This is what you'd expect.And in particular,\nas we vary-- sothis is our predictions--\nin particularas we vary-- so this is 1,\n2, with greater intensity.And the second prediction\nis that V-naughtshould be independent\nof frequency.Because the energy density\nand electromagnetic waveis independent of the frequency.It just depends\non the amplitude.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.471}, {"text": "And I will use nu to\ndenote the frequency.So those are the predictions\nthat come from 802 and 803.But this is 804.And here's what the experimental\nresults actually look like.So here's the intensity,\nhere's the potential.And if we look at\nhigh potential,it turns out that--\nif we look, sorry,if we look at\nintermediate potentials,it's true that the high\nintensity leads to a largercurrent and the low intensity\nleads to a lower current.But here's the funny\nthing that happens.As you go down to\nthe critical voltage,their critical\nvoltages are the same.What that tells you is that\nthe kinetic energy kicked out--or the kinetic\nenergy of an electronkicked out of this piece\nof metal by the lightis independent of how\nintense that beam is.No matter how intense\nthat beam is, no matterhow strong the light you\nshine on the material,the electrons all come\nout with the same energy.This would be like\ntaking a baseballand hitting it with a really\npowerful swing or a reallyweak swing and seeing that\nthe electron dribbles awaywith the same amount of energy.This is very counter-intuitive.But more surprisingly,\nV-naught is actuallyindependent of intensity.But here's the real shocker.V-naught varies linearly\nin the frequency.What does change V-naught\nis changing the frequencyof the light in this incident.That means that if you take\nan incredibly diffuse light--incredibly diffuse light,\nyou can barely see it--of a very high frequency,\nthen it takes a lot of energyto impede the electrons\nthat come popping off.The electrons that come popping\noff have a large energy.But if you take a low-frequency\nlight with extremely high", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.536}, {"text": "intensity, then those electrons\nare really easy to stop.Powerful beam but\nlow frequency, it'seasy to stop those electrons.Weak little tiny beam\nat high frequency,very hard to stop the\nelectrons that do come off.So this is very\ncounter-intuitiveand it doesn't fit at all\nwith the Maxwellian picture.Questions about that?So this led Einstein\nto make a prediction.This was his 1905 result.One of his many totally\nbreathtaking papersof that year.And he didn't really\npropose a modelor a detailed theoretical\nunderstanding of this,but he proposed a\nvery simple idea.And he said, look, if\nyou want to fit this--if you want to fit\nthis experimentwith some simple equations,\nhere's the way to explain it.I claim-- I here means\nEinstein, not me--I claim that light comes\nin packets or chunkswith definite energy.And the energy is linearly\nproportional to the frequency.And our energy is equal\nto something times nu,and we'll call\nthe coefficient h.The intensity of\nlight, or the amplitudesquared, the intensity is\nlike the number of packets.So if you have a more intense\nbeam at the same frequency,the energy of each individual\nchunk of light is the same.There are just a lot more\nchunks flying around.And so to explain the\nphotoelectric effect,Einstein observed the following.Look, he said, the electrons\nare stuck under the metal.And it takes some\nwork to pull them off.So now what's the kinetic\nenergy of an electron thatcomes flying off-- whoops, k3.Bart might have a\nlaugh about that one.Kinetic, kE, not 3.", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.744}, {"text": "So the kinetic energy of\nelectron that comes flying off,well, it's the energy\ndeposited by the photon,the chunk of light,\nh-nu well we haveto subtract off\nthe work it took.Minus the work to extract the\nelectron from the material.And you can think of\nthis as how much energydoes it take to suck\nit off the surface.And the consequence of this\nis that the kinetic energyof an electron should be--\nlook, if h-nu is too small,if the frequency\nis too low, thenthe kinetic energy\nwould be negative.But that doesn't make any sense.You can't have negative\nkinetic energy.It's a strictly\npositive quantity.So it just doesn't work until\nyou have a critical value wherethe frequency times h--\nthis coefficient-- isequal to the work\nit takes to extract.And after that,\nthe kinetic energyrises with the frequency\nwith a slope equal to h.And that fits the\ndata like a chain.So no matter-- let's think\nabout what this is saying again.No matter what you do, if your\nlight is very low-frequencyand you pick some definite\npiece of metal thathas a very definite\nwork function, verydefinite amount\nof energy it takesto extract electrons\nfrom the surface.No matter how intense your\nbeam, if the frequency isinsufficiently high,\nno electrons come off.None.So it turns out none is\nmaybe a little overstatementbecause what you can have is\ntwo photon processes, wheretwo chunks hit one\nelectron at the right, justat the same time.Roughly speaking the same time.And they have twice\nthe energy, but youcan imagine that the\nprobability of twophoton hitting one electron at\nthe same time of pretty low.So the intensity has to\nbe preposterously high.And you see those sorts\nof multi-photon effects.But as long as we're not\ntalking about insanelyhigh intensities, this is an\nabsolutely fantastic probeof the physics.Now there's a whole\nlong subsequent storyin the development\nof quantum mechanicsabout this particular effect.And it turns out that\nthe photoelectric effectis a little more\ncomplicated than this.But the story line\nis a very useful one", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.596}, {"text": "for organizing\nyour understandingof the photoelectric effect.And in particular, this relation\nthat Einstein proposed outof the blue, with\nno other basis.No one else had ever seen\nthis sort of statementthat the electrons, or that\nthe energy of a beam of lightshould be made up of some\nnumber of chunks, each of whichhas a definite minimum\namount of energy.So you can take what you've\nlearned from 802 and 803and extract a little bit\nmore information out of this.So here's something\nyou learned from 802.In 802 you learned\nthat the energyof an electromagnetic\nwave is equal to ctimes the momentum carried by\nthat wave-- whoops, over two.And in 803 you\nshould have learnedthat the wavelength of\nan electromagnetic wavetimes the frequency is equal\nto the speed of light, C.And we just had Einstein\ntell us-- or declare,without further evidence,\njust saying, look this fits--that the energy of\na chunk of lightshould be h times the frequency.So if you combine\nthese together,you get another\nnice relation that'ssimilar to this one, which says\nthat the momentum of a chunkof light is equal\nto h over lambda.So these are two enormously\ninfluential expressionswhich come out of this argument\nfrom the photoelectric effectfrom Einstein.And they're going\nto be-- their legacywill be with us throughout\nthe rest of the semester.Now this coefficient has a name,\nand it was named after Planck.It's called Planck's Constant.And the reason that it's\ncalled Planck's Constanthas nothing to do with\nthe photoelectric effect.It was first this idea that\nan electromagnetic wave,that light, has an energy\nwhich is linearly proportional", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.996}, {"text": "not to its intensity\nsquared, none of that,but just linearly\nproportional to the frequency.First came up an analysis of\nblack body radiation by Planck.And you'll understand,\nyou'll go through thisin some detail in 804\nlater in the semester.So I'm not going\nto dwell on it now,but I do want to give you\na little bit of perspectiveon it.So Planck ran across this\nidea that E is equal to h/nu.Through the process of trying\nto fit an experimental curve.There was a theory\nof how much energyshould be emitted\nby an object that'shot and glowing as a\nfunction of frequency.And that theory turned out\nto be in total disagreementwith experiment.Spectacular disagreement.The curve for the\ntheory went up,the curve for the\nexperiment went down.They were totally different.So Planck set about writing\ndown a function thatdescribed the data.Literally curve-fitting,\nthat's all he was doing.And this is the\ndepths of desperationto which he was led,\nwas curve-fitting.He's an adult.He shouldn't be doing this,\nbut he was curve-fitting.And so he fits the\ncurve, and in orderto get it to fit the only thing\nthat he can get to work evenvaguely well is if he puts\nin this calculation of h/nu.He says, well, maybe when I sum\nover all the possible energiesI should restrict\nthe energies whichwere proportional\nto the frequency.And it was forced on him because\nit fit from the function.Just functional analysis.Hated it.Hated it, he\ncompletely hated it.He was really\nfrustrated by this.It fit perfectly, he\nbecame very famous.He was already famous, but he\nbecame ridiculously famous.Just totally loathed this idea.OK.So it's now become a cornerstone\nof quantum mechanics.But he wasn't so happy about it.And to give you a\nsense for how boldand punchy this paper by\nEinstein was that said,look, seriously.Seriously guys. e equals h/nu.Here's what Planck\nhad to say whenhe wrote a letter\nof recommendationto get Einstein into the\nPrussian Academy of Sciencesin 1917, or 1913.So he said, there is hardly\none among the great problemsin physics to which\nEinstein has notmade an important contribution.", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.992}, {"text": "That he may sometimes have\nmissed the target in hisspeculations as in his\nhypothesis of photons cannotreally be held too\nmuch

photons.Because of guys\nlike Planck, right.This is crazy.So this was a pretty bold idea.And here, to get\na sense for why--we're gonna leave that up\nbecause it's just sort of funto see these guys

happy\nhome and, you know.I've got that one.That's the one\nthat matters to me.So why is this so surprising?And the answer is really simple.We know that it's false.We know empirically, we've known\nfor two hundred and some yearsthat light is a wave.Empirically.This isn't like\npeople are like, oh Ithink it'd be nice\nif it was a wave.It's a wave.So how do we know that?So this goes back to the\ndouble-slit experimentfrom Young.Young's performance\nof this was in 1803.Intimations of it\ncome much earlier.", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.523}, {"text": "But this is really where\nit hits nails to the wall.And here's the experiment.So how many people\nin here have notseen a double-slit\nexperiment described?Yeah, exactly.OK.So I'm just going to quickly\nremind you of how this goes.So we have a source for waves.We let the waves get big until\nthey're basically plane waves.And then we take a barrier.And we poke two slits in it.And these plane\nwaves induce-- theyact like sources at the\nslits and we get nu.And you get crests and troughs.And you look at\nsome distant screenand you look at the pattern,\nand the pattern you gethas a maximum.But then it falls off,\nand it has these wiggles,these interference fringes.These interference fringes are,\nof course, extremely important.And what's going on here is that\nthe waves sometimes add in--so the amplitude of the\nwave, the height of the wave,sometimes adds constructively\nand sometimes destructively.So that sometimes you\nget twice the heightand sometimes you get nothing.So just because it's\nfun to see this,here's Young's actual diagram\nfrom his original noteon the double-slit experiment.So a and b are the slits, and\nc, d and f are the [INAUDIBLE]on the screen, the\ndistant screen.He drew it by hand.It's pretty good.So we've known for a very\nlong time that light, becauseof the double-slit experiment,\nlight is clearly wavy,it behaves like a wave.And what are the senses in\nwhich it behaves like a wave?There are two\nimportant senses here.The first is answered\nby the question,where did the wave\nhit the screen?So when we send in a wave,\nyou know, I drop a stone,one big pulsive wave comes out.It splits into-- it leads to\nnew waves being instigated hereand over here.Where did that wave\nhit the screen?", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.384}, {"text": "Anyone?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.It didn't hit this wave--\nthe screen in any one spot.But some amplitude\nshows up everywhere.The wave is a\ndistributed object,it does not exist at one spot,\nand it's by virtue of the factthat it is not a localized\nobject-- it is nota point-like object-- that\nit can interfere with itself.The wave is a big large\nphenomena in a liquid,in some thing.So it's sort of essential

get somedistribution if you look\nat where they all hit.Yeah?Everyone cool with that?And if we had covered\nover this slot, or slit,and let the baseballs\ngo through this one,same thing would have

calculations\ninvolving these interferenceeffects.And I'm going to\nbrush over them.Anyway the point of the\ndouble-slit experimentis that whatever else you\nwant to say about baseballsor anything else,\nlight, as we'velearned since 1803 in Young's\ndouble-slit experiment,light behaves like a wave.It is not localized, it hits the\nscreen over its entire extent.And as a consequence,\nwe get

the square\nof a1 plus a2 squared,has interference terms, the\ncross terms, from this square.So light, from\nthis point of view,is an electromagnetic wave.It interferes with itself.It's made of

best of both worlds.Everyone will be satisfied,\nunless you're notfrom the US, in which case\nthis is deeply disturbing.So of course the original\nSuperchunk is a band.So we've learned now from\nYoung that light is a wave.We've learned from the\nphotoelectric effectthat light is a bunch of chunks.OK.Most experimental\nresults are true.So how does that work?Well, we're gonna have\nto deal with

intuition.But here's a crucial thing.Before doing anything\nelse, we can just think,which one of these two is more\nlikely to describe electronswell.Well electrons are localized.When you throw an\nelectron at a CRT,it does not hit the whole\nCRT with a wavy distribution.When you take a single electron\nand you throw it at a CRT,it goes ping and there's\na little glowing spot.Electrons are

detector.And I'm now going\nto build supernova.OK.And they are creeping\nunder this black hole,and it's going to create\ngiant gravitational waves.And we're gonna use\nthose gravitational wavesand detect them with\nthe super advanced LIGO.And I'm gonna detect which\nslit it went through.But gravitational waves,\nthose aren't photons.So I really can make a\nlow-intensity gravitationalwave, and

like 10 slitsand individual particles\ngoing through one at a timeand hitting the screen\nand going, bing.So what you see is the\nlight going, bing, on a CCD.It's a pretty\nspectacular experience.So

if the distance between\nthese crystal planesis L-- or, sorry,\nd-- let me call it d.If the distance between\nthe crystal planesis d, what they discover is\nthat the interference effectsthat they observed,\nthese maxima and minima,are consistent with the\nwavelength of light.Or, sorry, with the\nelectrons behavingas if they were waves with\na definite wavelength,with a wavelength lambda\nbeing equal to some integer,n, over 2d sine theta.So this is the data-- these\nare the data they actually saw,data are plural.And these are the data\nthey actually saw.And they infer from\nthis that the

resolve\nindividual electrons.But that is what they see.And so in particular,\nplugging all of this backinto the experiment, you\nsend in the electronswith some energy,\nwhich correspondsto some
