did.Any questions from last time?No?OK.So what I want to do\ntoday is to continuetalking about futures\nand forward contracts.Today we're going to finish\nup on these interestinginstruments, with a\ncouple of examples,and then with a specific method\nfor pricing forward and futurescontracts.So let me refresh your memory,\nit's been a week, so I know.So we're going to go back and\nlook at a specific futurescontract.And I'm going to\ntake this contractand then try to talk a bit about\nhow you might use contractslike this in hedging\nyour risks, as wellas in making certain kinds\nof bets, if you will.So remember that this\ncontract is a contract thatwas issued on July 27, 2007--so it was the middle\nof the summer--for oil to be\ndelivered in December.And there's a specific\ndate in Decemberwhere all oil futures contracts\nof this type will settle--that is will come\nto maturity-- wherethe date is going to\nbe specified in advanceand everybody knows it.And so in July, when\nyou buy this contract", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.263}, {"text": "at a price of $75.06 per\nbarrel, and each contractis for 1,000 barrels.When you quote\n\"buy the contract,\"what that means is that you\nare agreeing today, July 27--you are agreeing\ntoday, that comeDecember you are going to\nbuy 1,000 barrels at a priceof $75.06 per barrel.So that's the agreement.And the party who is selling you\nthe contract, the counterparty,is agreeing to provide\nyou with that oilat that price in December.So the futures price is $75.06.And as we said last\ntime, the current marketprice on July 27, 2007,\nthat's called the spot price.The spot price may be higher or\nlower than the futures price,depending on what\nexpectations arefor what's going to happen with\noil over the subsequent sixmonth period.Now the initial margin,\nas I mentioned last time,was $4,050.The maintenance\nmargin, the marginthat you need to maintain.So that if the initial\nmargin goes down in value,you have to actually put\nmoney back into your brokerageaccount, your margin account.And if you fall below\nthat $3,000 threshold,you'll get a phone call, which\nis known as a margin call.Several weeks ago,\nsomebody told methat they've been getting\nlots of phone callsall from the same person,\na person called margin.And you know that can\nhappen when markets go awry.Now again no cash\nchanges hands today,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.158}, {"text": "because the value of the\ncontract when it's struckis a zero NPV transaction.And how do you\nknow it's zero NPV?Again, because if it's\npositive for one party,it's coming from\nthe other party.So which party would\nyou like to be?You'd like to be the party\nreceiving that positive NPV,nobody wants to be the party\nthat is losing the NPV.So the futures price\nwill adjust, in orderto make it zero NPV.In fact, that's what we mean\nwhen we say that it's zero NPV.It is the futures\nprice that makes it so.So I'll give me an example.If it turns out that somebody\nsuggests a futures priceof $60 a barrel on that day.Lots and lots of\npeople are goingto want to buy that\ncontract, because that'sa good deal relative to\nwhere oil really should be.And that means lots of people\nare going to want to buy,but nobody's going to want\nto sell at that price of $60.So if everybody wants to buy\nand nobody wants to sell,what has to happen to the price?Exactly, it goes up.And it keeps going up\nuntil the number of buyersequals the number of sellers.That's the point at which\nit's a zero NPV transaction.Now let's take a look\nat what the payoff isof such a contract on day zero,\nin this case July 27, 2007,the contract is worth nothing.But if the futures\nprice moves tomorrow,then the contract could\nactually have value.And a diagram of how that\nworks is something like this.If the futures price--not the spot-- the spot\nobviously will move also.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.224}, {"text": "But I'm talking about\nthe futures price,because

line\nshows you the payoffif you're holding a\nlong position in oneof these contracts-- if\nyou bought a contract.If you sold the contract,\nthen your payoff diagramis the dotted line.Now the blue line basically\nsays that if the futuresprice goes above $75.06,\nthen you make money.If the futures price goes\nbelow $75.06, you lose money.So when you buy a\ncontract like this,it is as if you\nactually bought the oil.But you haven't\nreally bought the oil,all you've done is\nto buy the rightand obligation to purchase\nthe oil in the future.Let me let me give you\nanother example that willmake this even more concrete.The only way to\nunderstand this--because this is not a natural\nsecurity for most of us--stocks and bonds you\nmight find natural,futures contracts are\nweird in that theyhave zero investment today,\nand so they're worthless today.But they're not worthless\nafter the initial date whenyou enter into that agreement.So let's do an\nexample Yesterday,you bought 10 December live\ncattle contracts on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange at a\nprice of $0.7455 per pound.OK, so you basically\nbought some cows.And the contract size\nis 40,000 pounds of cow.", "start":

but rather\nyou have the obligationto buy the cows in December for\na price of $0.7455 per pound,and there is 40,000\npounds of it.So the value of your\nposition is the sizeof the contract, multiplied\nby the futures price,multiplied by the\nnumber of contracts.So it's $298,200.That's the size\nof your position,or sometimes that's also\ncalled the notional size.You've heard that term over\nthe last few weeks-- notional.Well, this is an\nexample of a notional.So you don't actually\nown $298,200 of anything,because of course, we've said\nthat the contract is zeroNPV when you enter into it.All you've done is to agree\nto buy 40,000 pounds of cowin December at a\nparticular price.So the idea is that you\ncontrol the notional amountof $298,200, and what\nyou do specificallyget is the profits and\nlosses from that notional.So let's do an example.That was the position yesterday.No money changed hands.You got some initial margin\nthat you had to put down,but that's really your money\nin a brokerage account.You're not giving it to anybody.It's safety money,\nit's collateral.Now today what happens?Let's suppose that\ntoday the futures pricecloses at $0.7435.All right, it's

cattle farmerand you sold the contract,\nyou did a good thing,because you locked in\nthe price of $0.7455,and now the price went down.So let's calculate what the\nvalue of the notional sizeof the position is.It's $297,400.That yields a loss of $800.So you know what happens today?Today, your broker will\ndeduct $800 from your account,from your margin account,\nand take that $800and put it into the\ncattle farmer's account.So now he has the $800.Now, if the day\nafter, if tomorrow, itturns out that the\nprice of cattlegoes up by 2/10 of a cent,\nit goes back to $0.7455.You know what happens?You get $800 back.Now the cattle farmer loses that\n$800 and gives it back to you.You see this way you\nalways settle up every day.So if for some reason the cattle\nfarmer ends up going

get\nprotection under Chapter 7.But that will hurt\nyour credit ratingsand all other nasty things will\nhappen to you if that occurs.AUDIENCE: So when you're\nsaying that they close outyour account,

point.Is it generally possible\nthat your losses are greaterthan the amount of margin?So in that case, who gets\nleft holding the bag?You know who gets\nleft holding the bag?That blue box in the middle, the\nFutures Clearing corporation.But the reason that they\nestablish a particular levelof margin is to be able\nto ensure that that'sa very unlikely event.And it goes back to what\nare the

increased\ntheir margin levels.It's because the daily swings\nhave gotten much bigger.But as long as they can\ncover the one day movement,they don't have to go after\nyour home or your other assets.Yeah, Dennis.AUDIENCE: You said if I\nbought a contract now,then I just have to sit\non the same contract.What happens if I bought at\na $1.00, it's at $0.50 now,I can't sell at a $1.00.ANDREW LO: Oh, no.You certainly cannot\nsell at the $1.00,you have to sell at $0.50.SaysAUDIENCE: So I'm not\nreally out of the position.ANDREW LO: You are\nout of the position,because you don't\nhave a claim, or youdon't have a commitment to enter\ninto that trade in December.That's what I mean when I say\nyou're out of the position.You also happen to be out\nof money in your example.[LAUGHTER] In other\nwords, you lost $0.50.That's not coming back.But what it means\nto sell is that youbought a contract that\nsays in December you'regoing to buy 40,000 of cattle--you're committed to doing that.Now if on the other\nhand, the next dayyou decide you want to get\nout of that commitment--the way to get out\nof it is not to tryto contact the\ncounterparty and say,would you mind\ncanceling my trade.The way to do it is to simply\nsell a commitment at 40,000pounds of cattle for December.So your commitment to\nbuy and your commitmentto sell, basically\ncancel each other out.So on settlement date, the\nFutures Clearing corporationwill net out all of\nthese buys and sells,and the net amount\nwill be transactedbetween the providers\nof the cattleand the buyers of the cattle.AUDIENCE: So this\nmeans that there'sno physical delivery then.ANDREW LO: That's right.So that's an example where\nif you bought and sold,", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.279}, {"text": "then you would be netted\nout

percentage of--how do they make money?ANDREW LO: Well, their job\nis really not to make money,but to create an\nexchange for its members.So many exchanges\nare not for profit.Some of them are for\nprofit, but the objectiveof the Futures\nClearing corporationis really not to\nmake a lot of money.What they're trying to do\nis just create a marketand let people who want\nto trade with each other,trade freely and efficiently.They will charge perhaps\na small transactionfee, that you have\nto pay in orderto support the operations.But they're not trying to make\ntons of profits off of thatnecessarily.Now they may be trying\nto make profits offof other activities, but the\nobjective of the ClearingCorporation itself is not\nto make tons of profit,It's really just to provide\na stable environmentwhere people can transact.And in some cases, the\nmembers of the exchangeown the Clearing Corporation.So it's their own\ndollars that supportthe actual physical operations\nof the organization.AUDIENCE: And just\ngoing back to that pointyou had about no\nphysical delivery.Two or three weeks\nago, the priceof oil spiked,\n[INAUDIBLE] I thinkthe way I read in the\npapers, was peoplewere trying to sell it, not\nbuy it, because otherwise theywould get physical delivery.So do you recall that?ANDREW LO: I recall the spike.I certainly don't recall the\nlogic about physical delivery.I mean it could be that\nthere are a number of peoplewho are long the oil\ncontracts that basicallywant it to be cash settled.And the way that they\nhave it cash settledat a particular point in\ntime, before settlement date,is they close out\ntheir positions.And so by closing\nout their positions,they basically\nreverse the trade,and that would actually\npush down the oil price.",

risk involvedin a forward contract is\nsomewhat similar to the creditrisk in credit default swaps?And if so, is there something\nanalogous to a credit defaultswap that's similar\nto a futures contract?ANDREW LO: So the answer\nto your first questionis yes, because a credit default\nswap contract is basicallya kind of a forward contract.It does involve\nintermediate payments,but if it turns out that the\ncredit changes dramatically,those intermediate\npayments eithermay be too much or not enough\nto cover the underlyingvalue of the contract.And after you strike\na credit default swap,it will take on value.As for an exchange,\nwhat a wonderful idea.That is exactly what's\nbeing proposed now.It hasn't been\ndone yet, but therehave been a number of\nproposals to set upexactly a structure like this\nfor credit default swaps.In order to do that, you have\nto standardize those contracts,and you have to be able to do\nthe paperwork in a relativelyefficient manner.And so that's actually\nbeing discussed, debated,and I think that there's\na proposal by the ChicagoMercantile Exchange\nto start doing that.If you do start doing that, you\nwill see that market growingeven bigger than it is\ntoday, and at the same time,the risks are actually\ngoing to decrease.Because with daily settlement\nof credit default swaps,just like with futures\ncontracts, all you needis one day margin in order to\neliminate 99% of the problems.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.397}, {"text": "ANDREW LO: So let me--\nthat's a good question.Let me now talk about\nhow to price futuresand we'll take in\ninterest rates explicitly.So the question is what\ndetermines either a forwardor a futures price?You now know what a\nfutures price is, right?It's the price at which\nyou're willing to doa future transaction.What determines that price?We say supply and\ndemand and the market,but is there some logic that\nwe can give to this process?And the answer is\nyes, we're goingto use the exact same\nargument that we usefor pricing everything else.We're going to come up with\ntwo identical cash flows.And two assets that have\nidentical cash flowshave to have the same what?AUDIENCE: Price.ANDREW LO: Price, value, right.So for now, I'm going to\nactually ignore the differencebetween futures and forwards.The only difference is the\nback and forth amount of moneythat we give to each\nother, and therefore,the accumulated interest\nor foregone interestthat we pay when we put\nour money back and forthinto each other's accounts.So let me abstract\nfrom that and-- youknow if you're interested,\nyou can actuallysee the derivation of\nthat in recitation.I want to focus on\nthe bigger questionof how these things are priced\nwith respect to other prices.So let me start\nwith some notation.I've got a particular\ncontract, let's say a futuresor a forward contract.And I've also got the\nspot price of the assetat a point in time.So I'm going to let St\ndenote my spot price.I'm going to let F\nof little t big Tdetermine the forward price.And H of little t big\nT, the futures price.And for now, I'm\ngoing to just assume", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.285}, {"text": "that H and F are pretty close.Now notice that\nwhen I write downa futures price or\na forward price,I've got two sub-indexes.I've got little t\nand big T. The reasonI need two is that for every\nforward or futures contract,there are two dates you\nneed to worry about.The date at which you are\npricing the contract, namelytoday, and the settlement date.So you need to have\nthose two indexes.So right away we know\nthat this contractis a little bit more\ncomplicated than say a stock,where there is no\nsettlement date.So I want to go back\nto a comment thatwas made by one of you when\nwe first started talkingabout futures and forwards.And the comment was why\ngo to the trouble of usingthese contracts,\nwhen you could justbuy the asset itself\nand hold onto it.If you need oil in\nDecember, in orderto make sure you\nhave oil in December,why don't you just\nbuy it in Octoberand hold it for two months.Then you have it in December.And in fact, that's\nexactly what we'regoing to do to figure out\nwhat the appropriate price isof the specific futures\nor forward contract.So here we go.I'm going to do my\nexact same analysisthat I've done\nmany times before,when we tried to price\nbonds, and stocks,and other basic securities.The left hand\ncolumn here is goingto be the cash flows\nassociated witha typical forward contract.So a forward\ncontract is one way.You enter into the contract,\nlet's say at date zero.And you pay nothing\nfor the contract right,this is a zero NPV transaction.And you are long the\nforward contract,with the forward price F of 0,T.The only cash flow that\noccurs with a forward contractis on settlement date.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.27}, {"text": "And on settlement date,\nyou've agreed to pay F of 0,Tfor delivery of whatever it\nis that you bought the forwardcontract on.So the only cash flow that\ncomes out of a forward contractis this F right here.Everybody see that?Nothing up my sleeve, it's\nvery simple calculation.Now, I want you to look at\nthe right hand column, whichis going to be less simple.The right hand\ncolumn, I want youto imagine doing the following.I want you to imagine buying\nthe commodity at date zero.However, I don't want\nyou to use any money.I want you to buy it\nwith no money down.That's the start of a\nscam, it sounds like it,but I promise you it's not.So the way you're going\nto buy the commodityis you have to pay the\nprice, the spot price.And the spot prices\nis S sub 0 You don'thave S sub 0, so borrow it.Now, I'm going to\nabstract from creditrisk, which I know is on\neverybody's minds today.But let's suppose that\nyou're all good credits,so I'm not worried about loaning\nyou the money at the riskfree rate.So now you've borrowed\nS sub 0 dollars,and then you spent it right\naway buying the asset.So as of date zero, in the right\nhand column, you own the asset.Now you have to wait T\nperiods, and while you waityou may have some costs.For example, if the asset\nthat you bought is gasoline,well you've got to store\nit in just the right way.You probably don't\nwant to put it", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.27}, {"text": "next to your furnace\nin the basement.You probably want to put it\nin a cool place, isolated,and so on and so forth.On the other hand, if what\nyou bought is pork bellies,you probably want to put that\nin a freezer compartment, asopposed to in your garage.So you might have to\npay costs for storing.And at the end of\nthat time T, youhave to pay interest\non your loan.So you borrowed S\nsub 0 dollars, youdon't get that for free, you\ngot to pay interest on it.This is a question\nabout interest,so you've got to pay\ninterest on that money.And so you have to pay\nback at this point T--you have to pay back\nthe money you borrowed--S sub 0, 1 plus R\nto the capital T,plus whatever your\nstorage costs are.But I'm going to allow\nthat having the assetaround might be\nkind of convenient.There might be a benefit to\nhaving the asset around--a convenience yield.Maybe if you need to use it\nsooner, you have it there.And having it there saves you a\nlittle bit of trouble in orderto be able to get\nwhatever it is youneed to get done with\nthat underlying asset.So I'm going to deduct from\nmy cumulative storage costsany convenience yield--that's future speak for\nany kind of benefitsthat you get from holding\nonto the physical asset.So your net storage\ncosts are given here--that's what you pay at\nthe end of T periods.I argue that these two\ncash flows give youthe exact same\nvalue of the asset.In other words,\nin both cases youhappen to have the\nasset at the time T.So these two contracts\nhave to have the same value", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.269}, {"text": "because they offer

end,they've got to sell\nfor the same price.So this has to equal this.That's it.That's the simple argument.And the counter argument or\nproof that this has to be trueis-- let's assume it's not.Let's assume that this is\na lot bigger than this.Well, if this is bigger than\nthis, then what should you do?What?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]ANDREW LO: Right.Which one?Which one?Sell the forward\ncontract, and

if you\ncan, and then take the moneyand lend it out at interest\nrate r, and dot dot dot,you follow the logic.So that gives us a relationship\nbetween the forward priceand other stuff.And what is the

cumulative\nsum is going to end upbeing approximately the same.So for the purposes\nof this class,I'm going to assert that this\nis approximately the same.In fact, you can\nshow that there'sanother relationship that\nlooks at the interestrate per period.And it's a little bit\nmore complicated, but notmuch more complicated.You can see that in your\ntextbook, if you're interested.But for now, I want to just\nfocus on this relationship.This relationship tells us how\nto price futures and forwards.And now if I divide by 1 plus r,\nf to the T, then what I've gotis that the forward price\ndivided by the interest rate,that calculates the current\nvalue of that forward price,has got to equal the spot\nprice plus the present valueof the net storage costs.This is the relationship\nthat we've been looking for,and you guys have been\nstruggling for the last coupleof lectures.You've been asking well,\ngee, doesn't the interestrate belong in there, and\nwhat about having the asset,wouldn't it be nice to have\nit, and so on and so forth.All of those considerations\nare summed upin this one expression.A very nice expression.Very intuitive.What you pay at date T,

having the thing\nbetween now and settlement.That's it.Now this is for\nthe very beginningwhen you strike the contract.What about at an arbitrary\npoint in time between 0 and T?Well, all of these arguments\nwork exactly the same waywhen you're looking at two dates\nt and T, as opposed to 0 and T.So the relationship\nthat I showed you,it's a little bit\nmore complicated now,because you've got to take into\naccount the fact that the timeto settlement is\nnot capital T, it'scapital T minus\nwhere you are today.But that's the only change.Other than that,\neverything is the same.And you have to make\nsure that you accumulatethe future value of all\nthe net storage costs,so that you actually move\nall of the costs to the end,and then you bring\nit back to time T.Now, let's take\nthis out for a spin.Let's see how this works.Let's take a look at gold.Gold is easy to store.There's no storage costs really.I mean gold is relatively\ncompact, a little heavy,so you're going to have to lift\nit and put it in your vault,as some of you, I'm\nsure, are doing nowadays.[LAUGHTER] But the bottom\nline is that the storage costsare negligible.There are no dividends.Gold does not pay out dividends.There are no real\nbenefits either,there is no convenience yield.It's not like you need\na little piece of goldevery once in a while\nfor your pleasure,and so you want to scrape\nthat off and enjoy it.[LAUGHTER] It just\nsort of sits there.So if that's the\ncase, you factor thatinto that relationship\nthat I showed you,and that last term, the PV of\nnet storage costs is nothing.", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.299}, {"text": "And so the relationship\nis really simple.The forward slash\nfutures price todayis just equal to\nwhat the current spotprice is multiplied by 1 plus\nthe risk free rate of interestbetween today and\na settlement date.If this relationship\nis violated--when you look at gold\nfutures, and gold spot,and you see that this\nrelationship was violated,that's a sign that\nthere's an arbitrage.You can make money off of that.So that really is the way\nto make a million dollarswith no money down--is to try to find violations\nof this arbitrage relationship.It's going to be hard, because\nthere are a lot of people thatare looking at it all the time.And so when there is an\ninequality of some sort,it's probably not\ngoing to be very big,and it probably\nwon't last very long.But to the person\nwho found it first,they might actually be able\nto make a little bit offof that discrepancy, by\neither buying or selling gold,and transacting these\nmarkets quickly.Let me do another example.So this is gold.What about gasoline?Gasoline it turns out, is\nvery different from gold.First of all, it's a pain\nin the neck to store safely.So if you don't want to be\nblown up in the middle--and this is what I really mean\nby blowing up right, gasoline--you want to prevent\nthat from happening,you've got to pay\na storage cost.On the other hand, there\nis a convenience yield.If you've got the\ngasoline, you can actuallyuse it along the way.You have to replenish\nit, in orderto get the same level\nof stock at the end,but it's convenient\nthat you have it,instead of having to go get it.Because getting it\ninvolves trouble and costs.So that's the convenience yield.So if you factor that in, then\nwhat you get is the futures",

going\nto want to short it and dothe opposite.After Hurricane\nKatrina hit, we hadviolations from this for a\nperiod of time, which suggestedthat it was actually\nworthwhile for youto go out and build your\nown storage facilities,because the storage\nfacilities were destroyed.Now it's only if you\nhad the technologyto build those storage\nfacilities that youcould actually profit from it.But there are periods of time\nwhere market dislocation canoccur, and the discrepancy\nbetween futures prices and spotprices--that gives you\nvaluable informationabout what's happening in\nmarkets, and in some cases,in non-financial contexts,\nlike commodities.Whether there's a shortage\nor whether there's a glut.Weather impacts\nthese commodities.And so by looking\nat this relationshipyou gather very\nvaluable information.Here's another example.Another example is financials.I'm going to take this\nexample as the last onethat I want to\nfocus on, because Iwant to now talk about how to\nuse this for your own purposes.A financial future\nis a futures contracton an index like the S&P 500.So there, all of those\ncontracts are cash settled,there is no physical delivery.", "start": 2280.0,

future\nis really a pure beton an underlying index.And it gives you, the\ninvestor or the hedger,a way to get exposure or get out\nof exposure of that underlyingin a very direct way.Now in this case, there's\nno real convenience yield,but there is a\ndividend that getspaid by the particular\nset of securities.So if you're holding\nthe S&P 500 portfolio,then you're going to be\ngetting paid

to subtract offof this relationship.So you don't have\na cost of storage,because this is a\nfinancial futures,but you do have a convenience\nyield, in terms of a paymentif you held the

is, and thencalculate those weights.And then you've got to give\nthis order to your broker,and $1 million dollars\nisn't what it used to be,so I suspect that\nthat would generatesome pretty tiny trades.You got 500\nsecurities, and you'vegot a bunch of different\nodd lot trades.Good luck finding\na broker that'swilling to do it at\na reasonable price.It's a pretty long list.Or you can buy a\nfutures contract.In particular, you\ncan buy a contracton the S&P 500 futures.So I want to go through and\nshow you what that involves.Now let's take your $1\nmillion and let's depositit at the Futures\nBrokerage account.So the money is sitting there,\nearning whatever interest theypay you on that account.Which is not much, it's probably\nakin to a money market return.So what you do is you want\nto buy futures contractsand you want to\nhave the equivalentexposure of $1 million\ninvested in the S&P 500.Now the way that the S&P\n500 futures contract works,is that the value of the\ncontract, the notional amountof the contract, is\n250 times the index.Whatever the index is worth,\nthey just make up a number,like I don't know\n250, and multiply thatby the value of the index.And they say that is what your\nexposure is for one contract.So what is that?Let's suppose the the S&P\nindex is now at a 1,000.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.159}, {"text": "So the value of the

a pure bet that\nis equivalent to 250 timesthe S&P 500.So let's take a look\nat what that means.Suppose that the S&P index\nfluctuates, bounces around,then it turns out that you'll\nsee that your cash

notional valueof your portfolio with\nfour contracts is $900,000.So you've actually\nlost $100,000,and that's going to be\ndeducted from your account.If on the other hand,\nthe S&P goes up by 100,then your cash portfolio\nwill be worth $1,100,000,and your futures portfolio\nwill be worth the same.You will now get $100,000\ndeposited into your account.By holding this\nfutures contract,it's as if you

want to be able\nto let them do that,and allow them to basically\neither hedge their risks,or take on risks that\nthey're able to do.So this is an example of that.You're an investor.You want to

Notice that K\ndoes not have a time subscript,because it's fixed at the\ntime the options are issuedand it doesn't change throughout\nthe life of that option,it's part of the contract terms.And then the call price is C,t.Put price is P,t.And the value of these\ncontracts at maturityis actually pretty simple.If today a particular stock\nis trading at $60 a share,and you purchase an option to\nbuy that stock at $70 a sharein three months, does that\npiece of paper have any value?The current price is\n$60, this piece of papergives you the right to buy\nit at $70 in three months.Is that worthless?Why not?The price is at $60, you\ncan get it at $60 today.So why would you want it at\n$70 three months from now?Exactly the price may go up.The reason the piece\nof paper is not worthzero today is that\nthere is a chance,no matter how small\nyou might think it is,there is still a chance that\nsomething wonderful mighthappen in the next\nthree months, and thenthe price will go up to $80.And if it goes up to\n$80, you'll be very happythat you have the\nright to buy it at $70.How happy will you be?You'll be $10 per share happy.[LAUGHTER] That's what\nthat expression says.", "start": 3960.0, "heat": 0.305}, {"text": "On the expiration date,\nyou get to buy the shares--if you're holding a call\noption, you get to buy it for Kdollars, but in fact the market\nhas determined that the priceat that time is\nreally S,T dollars.So if you're holding this piece\nof paper, this is your profit--S,T minus K per share.Now if it turns out that\nyou get to buy it for $60,and it ends up trading\nat $40, well thenyou're not going to\nexercise that right.You're going to let\nthe option expire,and when it expires\nit'll be worthlessif this number is negative.It can be negative of\ncourse, but you're notobligated to buy it.On the other hand, if this\nwere a futures contract,you certainly are\nobligated to buy itand then you'd get\na negative return.But an option is a\nwonderful thing, in thatthe payoff is never negative.It's either zero or it's S,T\nminus K. That's for a call.Now a put option, it's\nexactly the reverse.If you get to sell the\nstock, then your profitis what you get to\nsell it at versuswhat it's really trading at.And so you actually\nhope that it's reallytrading at a very low price.Because if you get to\nsell it at a high price,but it's trading at a low price,\nyou profit the difference.So the payoff for a\nput option is exactlythe reverse, maximum\nof zero and K minus S.Now, it's very important that\nyou understand this asymmetry,because that asymmetry\nis going to leadto all sorts of interesting\nthings about these instruments.And before we go and talk\nabout that kind of asymmetry,I want to give you another\nway of looking at options.", "start": 4080.0, "heat": 0.22}, {"text": "Which is to look at options as\na kind of insurance contract,because actually all\ninsurance contracts area form of an option.So let me give you an example.Suppose that you want to insure\nthe value of a particular stockthat you're holding.You're holding General\nElectric and it'strading at $20 a\nshare, and you'dlike to make sure that it\nnever goes below $18 a share.You want to buy insurance that\nif it goes below $18 a share,you will get paid $18 a share.Well, the way you do that\nis you buy a put option.A put option on General\nElectric where the strikeprice is $18 a share.Because if it goes\nbelow $18 a share,you get to sell General\nElectric for that $18.So you'll get the\n$18, regardlessof whether it goes to $10,\nor $5, or who knows what.It turns out that the put option\nis exactly like insurance,and let's take a\nlook and see why.These are the typical terms\nof an insurance contract.What's the asset\nthat you're insuring?General Electric.What's the current asset value?$20 a share.What's the term of the policy?How long do you\nhave the policy for?It's the time to maturity.What's the maximum coverage?What are you covered for?$18 a share, that's right.That's what you bought\nthe coverage for,that's what you're going\nto get if it goes below.What's the deductible?How much could you lose\nbefore the insurance kicks in?$2 a share, exactly.That's the deductible.And finally, what\ndoes it cost youto buy this insurance,\nwhat's the insurance premium?", "start": 4200.0, "heat": 0.225}, {"text": "Exactly, the price of the put.That's it.Beautiful thing.A put option is nothing more\nthan an insurance contracton the value of a stock.And it's going to\nturn out that a calloption will be intimately\ntied to what a put option is.So every call option can be\nconverted into a portfolio thatincludes a put.So all options you can think\nof as insurance contracts,but there are a few differences.The difference\nbetween an option isthat you can exercise it early.So for example, for\nwhatever reason,if you decide that you want\nto buy General Electric at $18a share, when it's\ntrading at $17.50,and you still have\none month to go.But you want to get paid that\n$18 now, you can do that.You can't do that with\nyour car insurance, right?I guess you could, you\ncould ram it into a post,and I want to get\npaid now, so let's--[LAUGHTER] But that's not\nreally considered a proper thingto do.So early exercise\nis one difference.Second difference\nis marketability.If at some point you don't\nwant the insurance anymore,you can't get rid of it and\ngive it to somebody else.You can't transfer your auto\ninsurance to your friend,if you decide you\ndon't need it anymore.But you can transfer the\ninsurance policy here.You can sell the\noption, you can sell it.And also there\nare dividends thatare being paid on the stock\nthat you have to worry aboutwith options, whereas with\na typical insurance contracta car doesn't necessarily\npay dividends.And the reason that's important\nis when it pays dividends,the value goes down, and so\nyou have to make adjustmentsfor that with an option.You have to protect an\noption for dividend payments.You don't need to do\nthat for insurance,because typically you don't\nassume that the insurancevalue, the value of the asset\ngoes down that much over time.", "start": 4320.0, "heat": 0.287}, {"text": "Yep?AUDIENCE: When they\nbuy the put option,they also eliminated\nthe chance to enjoy it,from the prices\nare going to go up,with the futures we'd\nhave a higher value.ANDREW LO: Well, no\nthat's actually not true.With the put\noption, it gives youthe right to sell the stock.If you buy the stock\nand you hold onto it,and you also buy a put,\nthat protects the downside.But the upside,\nthat's all yours.Because as the\nstock goes up, whathappens to the value of the put?AUDIENCE: It's going to zero.ANDREW LO: Exactly,\nit stops at zero.So as the stock goes up, the put\ndoesn't have any value anymore.It becomes worthless,\nworth less and less.And on the date of\nexpiration, if the stockis way above the\nvalue of the strike,then it expires worthless.It doesn't go negative.If it went negative, if\nyou had a futures position,then you'd be right, you've\nactually capped your gains.But this doesn't.See with this you get the\nbest of both, or so it seems.You get the upside, but\nit protects the downside.And as you all probably\nknow, insurance is not cheap.So it sounds good, but\nyou've got to pay for this.And so you bet that the price\nof a call option or put optionis not zero when you strike it.Unlike a futures contract\nthat's worthless,an option is not\nworthless on day zero.It's worth a lot.For example, right now\nwhat's really expensive--and if you want to check this,\nyou could take a look for

things is is it worth it?In order to decide\nwhether it's worth it,you've got to do two things.First look into the inner\nmost workings of your own souland ask how frightened\nyou truly are.And the
