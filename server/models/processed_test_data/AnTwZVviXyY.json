[{"text": "PROFESSOR: This is a\nfull semester classdivided into two\nhalf semester pieces.15.871 is the six\nunit H-1 class.That's what probably most of\nyou are thinking about doing.What I would urge you to\ndo is to take both halves,because you and I will\nco-teach the fall semester.The second half\nis called 15.872.And although we think\nthis first half is good,the real value in\nterms of developinga meaningful capability\nfor you to beable to use system dynamics and\nsystems thinking effectivelywill come if you take\nthe full semester.You don't have to exercise\nthat real option today.You can wait make that\ndecision a little later.But think about it for right\nnow for your semester planning.There are five assignments over\nthe course of this semester.So the good news is\nthere are no exams.The bad news is that\nthere are five assignmentsand this class has a\nreputation that I believeis reasonably well deserved\nfor having a heavy workload.The reason for that is clear.I can't teach you anything.I know you're\ngiggling over there.But it's absolutely true.I can't teach you anything.All that I can do--\nall that we can dois create an opportunity for\nyou to learn for yourself.You have to do it,\ntry it, practice it,if you're going to\ndevelop the capability.That is not going to\nhappen by coming to class.Now, you need to come to\nclass, and participationis part of the grade.But that's not sufficient.It's also necessary for\nyou to try everything out.And that is why we\nhave those assignments.You also are going to need\nto read the textbooks.So this is the book.And it's pretty fat and heavy.You're not going to be asked\nto read the whole thing.The bad news on\nthat is I wrote it.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "So I can tell you that it'll\ndefinitely cure your insomnia.I don't care if you buy it.Although I always\nsay, if you buy two,then you can kind of\ngo like this all day,and you can save money by\nquitting your gym membership.But I don't care if you buy it.I do care that you read it.You can't do well\non the assignmentsunless you read the material\nin the book carefully,and work through some\nof those examples.Chapter one is what you\nneed to be reading first.The syllabus tells you\nwhat to read for every day.In addition, from\ntime to time, weare asking you to read\na couple of short casestudies or other material.And we'll provide\nfollow up articlesfrom the professional literature\nfrom time to time as well.So the question is why?Why do we need something like\nsystem dynamics and systemsthinking?And I think the\nanswer is not simplythat the world is changing\nfaster and faster.Things are accelerating.Everybody knows that.That's kind of the price of\nadmission to the world today.It's that, despite all the tools\nand methods that we've got,all the analytic power\nand our cleverness,things are getting\nharder and harder.And more and more of the\npolicies that we implementare failing to solve\nthe pressing challengesthat we face.And this is not\nwhat I'm saying thisis what the senior leaders and\norganizations with whom I work,what they tell me.And the thoughtful ones--\nthe most thoughtful ones--they say it's not\njust the thingsare getting harder\nand more difficult,despite our cleverness\nand our analytic power,but because of it.That we're too clever\nfor our own good.And I illustrate this\ntraditionally with this pictureof one of the leaders\nof an organizationthat I've worked with.And here is the poor\nguy in this office.Now many of you have\nseen this before,but I think it's just a great\nrepresentation of what'sgoing on.Like most senior managers\nor lower level managers,he is completely squeeze\nby pressures on all sides.Can't breathe.Claustrophobic.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.144}, {"text": "And what you're asked to do as\na manager is to be decisive.You've got to make decisions.Boo.Things are now much\nbetter for you.Now you can begin to\nbreathe more easily,see out to the side.Relief.Things are great.But as you may\nsuspect, there couldbe some unanticipated\nside effects.Now, the reason I like\nthis and the reasonI'm showing it to\nyou again, so Ithink it's a great way to\ncapture the core of whata lot of systems\nthinking is about.Why does this happen?Why does this happen?And why don't people learn?So it's not just\nthat it happens once,but people do it\nover and over again.So why?That's a real question for you.So what do think?Why might this happen?And why might this\nphenomenon persist?Yeah go ahead.AUDIENCE: It's only\nin the short term,and the short-term\nimplications of that action.PROFESSOR: Great.So short-term time\nrise and not thinkingabout what might happen later.So apres-moi le deluge.I don't care.I'll do what's good for\nme in the short run.I don't care if it\ndestroys the world later.OK great.What else?Yeah go ahead.AUDIENCE: Feedback loops.So you would get some\nfeedback and you won't reallyconsider it the way\nthat it really is.PROFESSOR: So there's definitely\na feedback loop here, right?And the problem is that\nit takes too much timefor that to happen.So the time delay in\ngetting the feedback-- maybemissing feedback-- is connected\nto the short time horizon.In fact, what's going to\nhappen in most organizationsto this manager right about now?He solved the problem, right?So what happens to him.AUDIENCE: He gets promoted.PROFESSOR: Of course.He gets promoted.You get to sit in the chair.It's a combination of\nshort time horizon,and not only by that\nguy, but the peoplewho are evaluating\nhis performanceand maybe encouraging him to\nhave a short time horizon.That's not going to be good\nfor anybody in this situation.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "What else?What else might be going on?We get somebody\nover on this side?[? Argoff, ?] what do you think?AUDIENCE: I think it's\nalso, like you said it was,when you're thinking\nonly short term,you find that can you make\na decision without thinkingabout what the impact of--PROFESSOR: This is a\nreally important point.And let me put it\ninto our terms.When people say, it wasn't my\nfault, the reason we failedwas some outside effect, some\nunanticipated side effect,something that came\nfrom out there.It wasn't my fault.They're trying to persuade\nyou that they, in fact, aregreat managers and shouldn't\nbe held responsiblefor the bad outcome.In fact, almost all the time,\nit is at least partiallythe result of their\nown past decisions.Feedback they didn't understand\nand didn't recognize.And what they're\nactually trying to dois persuade you that\nit wasn't their fault.But what they're\nreally communicatingis how narrow and\nblinkered and inadequateis their understanding of\nthe system in which they'reembedded, what we would\ncall their mental model.I think that's where\nyou were going.So that's a really\nimportant ideain what we're going to be about.So one of the mental\nmodels that I thinkis the most damaging out there\nis this open loop mental model.And here's the question.In a project that\nyou've been involved inor that you were\nreviewing, how many timeshave you seen this picture?Can I see hands?Who's seen it?Almost everybody.Who's drawn it in one of\ntheir project proposals?About 3/4 of the same hands.This is a very interesting,\nunintended revelationof mental models\nthat people holdabout complex dynamical systems.And it basically says, there's\na beginning and middle and endto the project.We're going to\nidentify the issue.We're going to gather the\ndata, evaluate our choices,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "select the optimal solution,\nand then implement.And of course, the students\nin the last class when I said,what's wrong with this picture?They all said, oh well.You know.You're a professor.So you've never implemented\nanything in your life.OK.Now, in fact, a\nlot of my researchis devoted to the\nquestion of whyimplementation so often fails.We're going to talk about that.System dynamics isn't useful\nunless you can actuallymake things different.If you can't catalyze\nchange in your organizationsin which you're engaged,\nnone of this is meaningful.You might as well\nbecome a professor.So we're going to\ntalk a lot about--and I mean that in all\nthe negative sensesthat you're laughing about.We're going to talk about\nsystem dynamics in action,especially in the second\nhalf of the class.You're going to see a lot of\ncase studies of how people havebeen able to use these\ntools effectivelyin difficult political\norganizational settings.So that's an issue.But it's not the real problem.The real problem with this\nis that it has this open loopone-way sequential\nperspective thatsays there's a beginning,\nmiddle and end to the project.I don't know about you, but no\nproject I ever been involved inhas ever gone that way.There's always\niteration, feedback.We have to go back to the\nbeginning, almost alwaysunintended, unplanned\niteration, because we go throughand we find out as\nwe gather the data,we interview the folks\nthat are engaged.And we evaluate\nour technologies,supply chain for the new\nproduct or whatever it is.We really didn't\nunderstand the situation.We really didn't understand\nwhat the real problem is.We have to loop back\nto the beginning.This happens continually all\nthe way through the project.And it's that feedback\nthat's critical here.So this is the metaphor that I\nwant you to fix in your mind.You make decisions.Your decisions change the world.And then that creates\nnew informationwhich changes your next decision\nin a continual, emergent,iterative set of\nfeedback processes.Now let me make this\na little more formal.Again, this is a slight\nreview for those of youwho have had me in orientation.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "But it's worth it,\nespecially if youhaven't seen this for awhile.So here's that open\nloop perspective.People say, I know my goals.I want better market share.I want more profitability.I want a bigger house, or a\nnicer car, whatever it is.That's going to\nmotivate my decisions.And then my decisions\nare going to changethe state of the world, state\nof the system, problem solved.That's wrong.I can't know what\ndecisions to makejust because I know\nwhere I want to be.I have to also know\nwhere I am right now.There has to be a feedback.So the example I always give is\nthat, I'm a bicycle commuter,and as I was riding\ninto MIT from Lexingtonthis morning, as\nevery day, I mustkeep my bike on the right\nhand side of the path.If I don't, I'm going\nto have a crash.So just knowing that I need\nto be on the right hand sideis not enough for me to know\nhow to turn the handlebars.I have to have the feedback\nfrom where my bicycle actuallyis in order to know which\nway to turn the handlebars.It is the same for you, driving\nyour car or flying an aircraft.Now if flying your organization\nthrough hostile skies, dogfighting with the\ncompetition, keeping investorshappy and calm in the\nback, and serving themnice drinks and hors d'oeuvres--\nif flying your companywas just as easy as\nflying an aircraft, whichisn't that easy by the was.It doesn't take much bad\nweather, fatigue, or substancesin your bloodstream to\ndegrade your abilities somuch that you're going to crash\nthe plane, crash your car,or crash your bicycle.But if it was as easy to\nrun your company as itis to ride a bike, no problem.We wouldn't need this class.But it's not.And it's not easy in part,\nbecause that feedback loop,which represents the intended\neffects of your decisions,but doesn't capture\nthe unintended effects.It's only piece of the system.So you're embedded in a much\nmore intricate complex systemin which that's what's\ngoing on for you.That represents mental models\nof what you ought to do.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "But mental models are limited.And all the impacts of your\ndecisions-- all the effectsof your decisions that you\ndidn't think about in advance,and that aren't part\nof your mental model,they're going to manifest\nas so-called side effects.Remember there's no such\nthing as a side effect.There's just the effects\nthat are in your mental modelthat you were counting\non and everything elseis going to manifest as\na so-called side effect.And they're usually\ngoing to feedbackin a way that's\nopposite to your goals.Much more interesting,\nyou're notthe only player in the world.So there's all the\nother actors out there,all the other agents out there.And they have their own\ngoals, which are typicallydifferent from your goals.You want more market\nshare, so do they.There is only 100% to divide up.And every time you\nmake decisions,even if they're\nefficacious that pulledthe world closer to\nyour goals, they'renecessarily going to be\npulling the world fartheraway from those\nother folks goals--your customers, your suppliers,\nyour employees, the investors,the competitors, the communities\nin which you operate,the natural world in which\nall of that is embedded.That's all going to be there.And those goals are going to\nmotivate them to take action,to try to bring the\nstate of the worldback to what they want it to be.Their mental models\nare limited too.And so they're going to generate\nunintended so-called sideeffects.And now this is getting to\nbe a fairly complex thingto manage-- not as easy\nas riding a bicycle.The whole story here is about\nexpanding the boundariesof your mental models so that\nmore and more of this structureis something that you can\nbegin to think about and tryto take into account\nwhen you make decisions.You're never going\nto get it all,because all models are wrong.Model is not the real system.Only the reality is the reality.And everything in your head is\na limited, filtered, imperfectrepresentation.But we can do a lot better\nthan the mental modelsthat we have now.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So what are we going to do?What we're going to\ndo is develop toolsin this class to elicit\nyour mental models,articulate them, and do that\nin the context of busy peoplein organizations.We're going to explicitly\naccount for feedback,and stocks and foils, and time\ndelays, and non-linearities,and the other elements of\ncomplex dynamical systems.And then we're going\nto use simulationto figure out what that means.Not because the model is\ngoing to give us the answer--all models are wrong-- because\nthe simulation models are goingto give us insight that\nimproves our mental modelsand the mental models\nof all the peoplewho need to be involved in\norder for change to happen,so that people are empowered\nwith high leverage,effective policies to go out\nthere and make a difference.You can read in the syllabus\nhow we're going to do that.But I think there\nare three core ideasI'd like to leave you with\nbefore we break for today.The first is that it's the\nstructure of complex systemsthat generates their behavior.That structure\nconsists of the physicsof the system, the information\nthat's available to you,and then the decision\nrules that youused to turn that\ninformation into action.All three of those\nare relevant here.Mental models matter a lot.It is not enough just to come\nup with the right answer.And it's not enough\njust to changethe physics of the system, or\nthe information with a new ITsystem, or the incentives\nthat people face.All those are\nimportant, but theyaren't generally sufficient.And one of the very powerful\nmental models that's out thereis what we call the\nfundamental attributionerror in psychology.And this is an idea you should\nhave learned at the beer game.And it's the idea that if you\nask me why I've screwed up,I've got reasons\nknown as excuses.It was the customer's fault.It was somebody else's fault.The sun was in my eyes.But if I'm asked to\nexplain why use screwed up,It's because you're not capable.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "You don't have what it takes,\nyou and everybody like you.And that is almost always wrong.And it's low leverage.It doesn't help.So to put that into\npractice in this class, whenwe come in here, and you\nwork with us this semester,we're going to make the\nfollowing basic assumption.We believe that everybody\nin this room is intelligent,is capable, cares about doing\ntheir best, and
