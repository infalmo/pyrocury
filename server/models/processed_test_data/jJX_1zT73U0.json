About--?AUDIENCE: The exam.PROFESSOR: The exam.Yes, absolutely.So the exam is, as you all\nknow, on Thursday, a week hence.So on Tuesday we\nwill have a lecture.The material Tuesday will\nnot be covered on the exam.The exam will be a\nreview of everythingthrough today's lecture,\nincluding the problems that,which for some\ntechnical reason I don'tknow why didn't get posted.But it should be up\nafter lecture today.The exam will be a\ncombination of short questionsand computations.It will not focus on an\nenormous number of computations.It will focus more\non conceptual things.But there will be a few\ncalculations on the exam.And I will post some\npractice problemsover the next couple of days.AUDIENCE: Do we have a\nproblem set due next week?PROFESSOR: You do have a\nproblem set due Tuesday.And that is part of your\npreparation for the exam.Here's a basic strategy\nfor exams for this class.Anything that's on a\nproblem set is fair game.Anything that's not\ncovered on a problem setis not going to be fair game.If you haven't seen\na new problem on it,broadly construed,\nthen you won't--I won't test you on a topic\nyou haven't done problemson before.But I will take\nproblems and ideasthat you've studied before and\nspin them slightly differentlyto make you think through\nthem in real time on the exam.OK?", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "From my point of view,\nthe purpose of these examsis not to give you a grade.I don't care about the grade.The purpose of these\nexams is to give youfeedback on your understanding.It's very easy to slip through\nquantum mechanics and think,oh yeah, I totally--I got this.This is fine.But it's not always\nan accurate read.So that's the point.Did that answer your question?Other questions?Exam or-- yeah.AUDIENCE: About the harmonic\noscillator actually.PROFESSOR: Excellent.AUDIENCE: So when\nwe solved it Tuesdayusing the series\nmethod, so thereare two solutions\ntechnically, the even solutionand the odd term solution.So did boundary conditions\nforce the other oneto be completely zero, like\nthe coefficient in front of it?So there's like an A0 term which\ndetermines all the other ones.But there's an A0 term and an\nA1 term for the evens and odds.So did the other ones\njust have to be 0?PROFESSOR: This is a\nreally good question.This is an excellent question.Let me ask the question\nslightly differently.And tell me if this\nis the same question.When we wrote down our\ndifferential equation--so last time we did the\nharmonic oscillator.And Barton did give you\nthe brute force strategyfor the harmonic oscillator.We want to find the\nenergy eigenstates,because that's what we do to\nsolve the Schrodinger equation.And we turn that into a\ndifferential equation.And we solve this\ndifferential equationby doing an asymptotic analysis\nand then a series expansion.Now, this is a second order\ndifferential equation.Everyone agree with that?It's a second order\ndifferential equation.However, in our\nseries expansion weended up with one integration\nconstant, not two.How does that work?How can it be that there was\nonly one integration constantand not two?It's a second order\ndifferential equation.Is this he question?AUDIENCE: Yeah.PROFESSOR: OK, and this\nis an excellent question.Because it must be true,\nthat there are two solutions.It cannot be that there\nis just one solution.It's a second order\ndifferential equation.Their existence in uniqueness\ntheorems, which tell us thereare two integration constants.So how can it possibly be\nthat there was only one?Well, we did something\nrather subtlein that series expansion.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "For that series expansion\nthere was a critical moment,which I'm not going\nto go through but youcan come to my office\nhours again, but justlook through the notes.There's an important moment\nin the notes when we say, aha,these terms matter.But what we did is we\nsuppressed a singular solution.There's a solution of\nthat differential equationwhich is not well-behaved,\nwhich is not smooth,and in particular\nwhich diverges.And we already did, from\nthe asymptotic analysis,we already fixed that the\nasymptotic behavior wasexponentially falling.But there's a second solution\nwhich is exponentially growing.So what we did, remember\nhow we did this story?We took our wave\nfunction and we said,OK, look, we're\ngoing to pull off--we're going to first\nasymptotic analysis.And asymptotic analysis\ntells us that either wehave exponentially growing\nor exponentially shrinkingsolutions.Let's pick the exponentially\nshrinking solutions.So phi e is equal\nto e to the minusx over 2a squared\nsquared, times some--I don't remember what\nBarton called it.I'll call it u of x.So we've extracted, because\nwe know that asymptotically ittakes this form.Well, it could also\ntake the other form.It could be e to the\nplus, which wouldbe bad and not normalizable.We've extracted that, and then\nwe write down the differentialequation for u.And then we solve that\ndifferential equationby series analysis, yeah?However, if I have a secondary\ndifferential equation for phi,this change of variables\ndoesn't change the factthat it's a secondary\ndifferential equation for u,right?There's still two\nsolutions for u.One of those solutions will be\nthe solution of the equationthat has this asymptotic form.But the other solution\nwill be one that has an eto the plus x squared\nover a squaredso that it cancels off\nthis leading factorand gives me the exponentially\ngrowing solution.Everyone cool with that?So in that series\nanalysis there'ssort of a subtle moment\nwhere you impose that youhave the convergent solution.So the answer of, why did we\nget a first order relation,is that we very carefully,\nalthough it may nothave been totally obvious,\nwhen doing this calculation", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "one carefully chooses the\nconvergent solution thatdoesn't have this\nfunction blowing up soas to overwhelm the envelope.That answer your question?AUDIENCE: Yep.PROFESSOR: Great.It's a very good question.This is an important\nsubtlety thatcomes up all over the place\nwhen you do asymptotic analysis.I speak from my heart.It's an important\nthing in the researchthat I'm doing right\nnow, getting these sortsof subtleties right.It can be very confusing.It's important to think\ncarefully through them.So it's a very good question.Other questions\nbefore we move on?OK.So I'm going to erase this,\nbecause it's not directlygermane, but it is great.OK, so one of the lessons\nof this brute force analysiswas that we constructed\nthe spectrum, i.e., the setof energy eigenvalues allowed\nfor the quantum harmonicoscillator, and we constructed\nthe wave functions.We constructed\nthe wave functionsby solving the\ndifferential equationthrough asymptotic analysis,\nwhich give us the Gaussianenvelope, and series expansion,\nwhich give us the Hermitepolynomials.And then there's some\nnormalization coefficient.And then we got the energy\neigenvalues by asking,when does this series\nexpansion converge?When does it, in fact\ntruncate, terminate,so that we can write\ndown an answer?And that was what gave\nus these discrete values.But fine, we can see that\nit would be discrete values.We're cool with that.In fact, Barton went through the\ndiscussion of the node theoremand the lack of degeneracy\nin one dimensional quantummechanics.So it's reasonable that we\nget a bunch of discrete energyeigenvalues, as we've talked\nabout now for two lectures.However, there's\na surprise here,which is that these\naren't just discrete,they're evenly spaced.We get a tower, starting with\nthe lowest possible energycorresponding to a-- sorry, E0--starting with the lowest\npossible energy, whichis greater than 0, and a\ncorresponding ground state wavefunction.And then we have a whole bunch\nof other states, phi 1, phi 2,phi 3, phi 4, labeled\nby their energies", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.268}, {"text": "where the energies\nare evenly spaced.They needed to be discrete,\nbecause these are bound states.But evenly spaced is a surprise.So why are they evenly spaced?Anyone, based on the\nlast lecture's analysis?Yeah, you don't\nhave a good answerto that from last\nlecture's analysis.It's one of the\nmysteries that comes outof the first analysis.When you take a\ndifferential equation,you just beat the crap out of\nit with a stick by solving it.With differential equations\nstrategies like thisyou don't necessarily get some\nof the more subtle structure.One of the goals\nof today's lectureis going to be to explain\nwhy we get this structure.Why just from the\nphysics of the problem,the underlying\nphysics, should youknow that the system is going to\nhave evenly spaced eigenvalues?What's the structure?And secondly, I want to\nshow you a way of repeatingthis calculation without doing\nthe brute force analysis thatreveals some of that more fine\ngrain structure of the problem.And this is going\nto turn out to beone of the canonical\nmoves in the analysisof quantum mechanical systems.So from quantum mechanics\nto quantum field theorythis is a basic\nseries of logic moves.What I'm going to do today\nalso has an independent lifein mathematics, in algebra.And that will be\nsomething you'llstudying in more detail in\n8.05, but I would encourageyou to ask your recitation\ninstructors about it,or me in office hours.So our goal is to understand\nthat even spacing and alsoto re-derive these\nresults without the sortof brutal direct assault\nmethods we used last time.So what I'm going to\ntell you about todayis something called\nthe operator method.It usually goes under the\nname of the operator method.To get us started let's go back\nto look at the energy operator", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.284}, {"text": "for the harmonic\noscillator, whichis what, at the end of\nthe day, we want to solve.p squared over 2m plus m omega\nsquared upon 2, x squared.And this is the operator\nthat we want to--whose eigenvalues we\nwant to construct,whose eigenfunctions\nwe want to construct.Before we do anything else, we\nshould do dimensional analysis.First thing you when\nyou look at a problemis do some dimensional analysis.Identify the salient\nscales and make things,to the degree possible,\ndimensionless.Your life will be better.So what are the parameters\nwe have available to us?We have h bar, because\nit's quantum mechanics.We have m, because we have\na particle of mass, m.We have omega,\nbecause this potentialhas a characteristic\nfrequency of omega.What other parameters do\nwe have available to us?Well, we have c.That's available to us.But is it relevant?No.If you get an answer that\ndepends on the speed of light,you made some horrible mistake.So not there.What about the number\nof students in 8.04?No.There are an infinite\nnumber of parameters thatdon't matter to this problem.What you want to know is, when\nyou do dimensional analysis,what parameters matter\nfor the problem.What parameters could possibly\nappear during the answer?And that's it.There are no other\nparameters in this problem.So that's a full set of\nparameters available to us.This has dimensions of\nmomentum times length.This has dimensions of mass,\nand this has dimensions of oneupon the time.And so what\ncharacteristic scales canwe build using these\nthree parameters?Well, this is a\nmoment times a length.If we multiply by a mass, that's\nmomentum times mass times x,which is almost momentum again.We need a velocity\nand not a position,but we have 1 over time.So if we take h bar\ntimes and omega,so that's px times\nm over t, thathas units of momentum squared.And similarly, this\nis momentum which", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.156}, {"text": "is x, which is length\nmass over time.I can divide by mass\nand divide by frequencyor multiply by time,\nso h bar upon m omega.And this is going to have\nunits of length squared.And with a little bit of\nforesight from factors of twoI'm going to use these to\ndefine two link scales.x0 is equal to h bar--I want to be careful\nto get my coefficients.I always put the two\nin the wrong place.So 2 h bar upon m omega.Square root.And I'm going to define p0 as\nequal to square root of 2 h bartimes m omega.So here's my claim.My claim is at the end of\nthe day the salient linkscales for this problem should\nbe integers or dimensionlessnumbers times this link scale.And salient momentum scales\nshould be this scale.Just from dimensional analysis.So if someone at\nthis point says,what do you think is\nthe typical scale, whatis the typical size of\nthe ground state wavefunction, the typical link scale\nover which the wave function isnot 0?Well, that can't possibly\nbe the size of Manhattan.It's not the size of a proton.There's only one link scale\nassociated with the system.It should be of order x0.Always start with\ndimensional analysis.Always.OK, so with that we can\nrewrite this energy.Sorry, and there's\none last energy.We can write an energy,\nthe thing with energy,which is equal to h bar omega.And this times a frequency\ngives us an energy.So we can rewrite this energy\noperator as h bar omegatimes p squared over p0.So this has units of energy.So everything here\nmust be dimensionless.And it turns out to be p squared\nover p0 squared plus x operator", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.343}, {"text": "squared over x0 squared.So that's convenient.So this has nothing to do\nwith the operator method.This is just being reasonable.Quick thing to note,\nx0 times p0 is just--the m omegas cancel, so we get\nroot 2h bar squared, 2 h bar.Little tricks like\nthat are useful to keeptrack of as you go.So we're interested in\nthis energy operator.And it has a nice form.It's a sum of squares.And we see the sum of squares,\na very tempting thing to dois to factor it.So for example, if I have\ntwo classical numbers,c squared plus d squared,\nthe mathematician in mescreams out to write c\nminus id times c plus id.I have factored this.And that's usually a step\nin the right direction.And is this true?Well yes, it's true. c\nsquared plus d squaredand the cross terms cancel.OK, that's great.Four complex numbers,\nor four C numbers.Now is this true for operators?Can I do this for operators?Here we have the energy\noperator as a sum of squares.Well, let's try it.I'd like to write that\nin terms of x and p.So what about writing the\nquantity x minus ip over x0over p0, operator, times\nx over x0 plus ip over p0.We can compute this.This is easy.So the first term gives us\nthe x squared over x0 squared.That last term gives\nus-- the i's cancel,so we get p squared\nover p0, squared.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.391}, {"text": "But then there are cross terms.We have an xp and a minus\npx, with an overall i.So plus i times xp\nover x0 times p0.x0 times p0,\nhowever, is 2 h bar.So that's over 2 h bar.And then we have the\nother term, minus px.Same thing.So I could write that as\na commutator, xp minus px.Everyone cool with what?Unfortunately this is\nnot what we wanted.We wanted just p\nsquared plus x squared.And what we got\ninstead was p squaredplus x squared close\nplus a commutator.Happily this\ncommutator is simple.What's the commutator\nof x with p?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.Commit this to memory.This is your friend.So this is just i h bar, so this\nis equal to ditto plus dittoplus i h bar.Somewhere I got a minus sign.Where did I get my minus\nsign wrong? x with ip.Oh now, good.This is good.So x with p is i--so we get an i h bar.No, I really did\nscrew up the sign.How did I screw up the sign?No I didn't.Wait.Oh!Of course.No, good.Sorry, sorry.Trust your calculation,\nnot your memory.So the calculation gave us this.So what does this give us?It gives us i h bar.So plus.But the i h bar times i is\ngoing to give me a minus.And the h bar is\ngoing to cancel,because I've got an h bar\nfrom here and an h barat the denominator minus 1/2.So this quantity is equal to the\nquantity we wanted minus 1/2.And what is the\nquantity we wanted,x0 squared plus p0 squared?This guy.So putting that\nall together we canwrite that the

tempting\nto say, well that isn't reallymuch an improvement.You've just made it uglier.But consider the following.And just trust me on this one,\nthat this is not a stupid thingto do.That's a stupid

before I move on, questions?OK.So here's a mathematical\nseries of a facts and claims.I claim the following.Given any linear\noperator we can build--there's a natural way\nto build without makingany additional assumptions or\nany additional ingredients.We can build another\noperator, o dagger, hat, hat,in the following way.Consider the inner\nproduct of f with g,or the bracket of f with g.So

says\nis, take your function g.Act on it with the operator o.Multiply by the\ncomplex conjugate.Take the integral.This is what we\nwould have done if wehad taken the inner product\nof f with the function weget by taking o and\nacting on the function g.So here's the thing.What we want-- just an aside--", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "what we want to do is\ndefine a new operator.And here's how I'm\ngoing to define it.We can define it by\nchoosing how it acts.I'm going to tell you\nexactly how it acts,and then we'll\ndefine the operator.So this operator, o with a\ndagger, called the adjoint,is defined in the following way.This is whatever\noperator you need, suchthat the integral gives you--such that the following is true.Integral dx o on f,\ncomplex conjugate, g.So this is the\ndefinition of this daggeraction, the adjoint action.OK so o dagger is the adjoint.And sometimes it's called\nthe Hermetian adjoint.I'll occasionally say\nHermetian and occasionally not,with no particular order to it.So what does this mean?This means that\nwhatever o dagger is,it's that operator\nthat when acting on gand then taking the\ninner product with fgives me same answer as\ntaking my original operatorand acting on f and taking\nthe inner product with g.Cool?So we know how-- if we know\nwhat our operator o is,the challenge now is\ngoing to be to figure outwhat must this o\ndagger operator be suchthat this expression is true.That's going to be my\ndefinition of the adjoint.Cool?So I'm going to do\na bunch of examples.I'm going to walk through this.So the mathematical\ndefinition isthat an operator o\ndefined in this fashionis the Hermetian adjoint of o.So that's the\nmathematical definition.Well, that's our version of\nthe mathematical definition.I just came back from\na math conference,so I'm particularly chastened\nat the moment to be careful.So let's do some quick examples.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.168}, {"text": "Example one.Suppose c is

integral dx of c\non f complex conjugate times g.But what is this?Well, c is just a number.So when we take its\ncomplex conjugatewe can just pull it out.So this is equal to the\nintegral dx c complex conjugate,f star g.But I'm now going\nto rewrite this,using the awesome power of\nreordering multiplication,as c star.And I'm going to put\nparentheses around thisbecause it seems like fun.So now we

must be this state,and there must be this state,\nand there must be this state.Yeah?OK, so that's good so far.But what happens?Well, A on this guy gave me 0.And this is going to\nbe some phi tilde 0.Suppose that this tower ends.And now you have to\nask the question,can there be two\ndifferent stateswith two different\nenergies with a0?Can there be two\ndifferent statesthat are annihilated by a0?Well, let's check.What must be true of any\nstate annihilated by a0?Well, let's write the energy\noperator acting on that state.", "start": 4080.0, "heat": 0.231}, {"text": "What's the energy of that state?Energy on phi 0 is\nequal to h bar omega.This is a very good question,\nso let's go through it.So it's equal to h bar\nomega times a daggera plus 1/2 on phi 0.But what can you say about this?Well, a annihilates phi 0.It gives us 0.So in addition to a being called\nthe lowering operator it's alsocalled the\nannihilation operator,because, I don't know, we're\na brutal and warlike species.So this is equal\nto h bar omega--this term kills phi 0--\nagain with the kills--and gives me a\n1/2 half leftover.1/2 h bar omega phi 0.So the ground state, any state--any state annihilated by a\nmust have the same energy.The only way you can\nbe annihilated by ais if your energy is this.Cool?So what does that tell you\nabout the second ladderof hidden seats that we missed?It's got to be degenerate.It's got to have\nthe same energies.I drew that really\nbadly, didn't I?Those are evenly spaced.So it's got to be degenerate.However, Barton proved for you\nthe node theorem last time,right?He gave you my spread\nargument for the node theorem?In particular, one of\nthe consequences of thatis it in a system\nwith bound states,in a system with\npotential that goes up,you can never have\ndegeneracies in one dimension.We're not going to prove\nthat carefully in here.But it's relatively\neasy to prove.In fact, if you come\nto my office hoursI'll prove it for you.It takes three minutes.But I don't want to set\nup the math right now.So how many people know\nabout the Wronskian?That's awesome.OK, so I leave it to you as an\nexercise to use the Wronskianto show that there cannot be\ndegeneracies in one dimension,which is cool.Anyway, so the Wronskian for the\ndifferential equation, which isthe energy eigenvalue equation.There can be no degeneracies\nin one dimensional potentials", "start": 4200.0, "heat": 0.605}, {"text": "with bound states.So what we've just shown is\nthat the only way that therecan be extra states\nthat we missedis if there's a tower with\nexactly identical energies allthe way up.But if they have exactly\nidentical energies,that means there's a degenerate.But we can prove that there\ncan't be degeneracies in 1D.So can there be an extra\ntower of states we missed?No.Can we have missed any states?No.Those are all the\nstates there are.And we've done it without\never solving a differentialequation, just by using\nthat commutation relation.Now at this point it's\nvery tempting to say,that was just sort of\nmagical mystery stuff.But what we really did\nlast time was very honest.We wrote down a\ndifferential equation.We found the solution.And we got the wave functions.So, Professor Adams,\nyou just monkeyed aroundat the chalkboard with\ncommutators for a while,but what are the\ndamn wave functions?Right?We already have the answer.This is really quite nice.Last time we solved that\ndifferential equation.And we had to solve that\ndifferential equationmany, many times,\ndifferent levels.But now we have a very\nnice thing we can do.What's true of the ground state?Well, the ground\nstate is annihilatedby the lowering operator.So that means that a acting\non phi 0 of x is equal to 0.But a has a nice expression,\nwhich unfortunately I erased.Sorry about that.So a has a nice expression.a is equal to x over\nx0 plus ip over p0.And so if you write\nthat out and multiplyfrom appropriate\nconstants, this becomesthe following\ndifferential equation.The x is just multiplied by x.And the p is take a\nderivative with respectto x, multiply by h bar upon i.And multiplying by i over\nh bar to get that equation,this gives us dx plus\np over h bar x0--sorry, that shouldn't be an i.That should be p0.x on phi 0 is equal to 0.", "start": 4320.0, "heat": 0.668}, {"text": "And you solved this\nlast time when youdid the asymptotic analysis.This is actually a\nridiculously easy equation.It's a first order\ndifferential equation.There's one\nintegration constant.That's going to be the\noverall normalization.And so the form is\ncompletely fixed.First order\ndifferential equation.So what's the\nsolution of this guy?It's a Gaussian.And what's the width\nof that Gaussian?Well, look at p0 over h bar x0.We know that p0 times\nx0 is twice h bar.So if I multiply by x amount\non the top and bottom,you get 2 h bar.The h bars cancel.So this gives me\ntwo upon x0 squared.Remember I said it would\nbe useful to rememberthat p0 times x0 is 2h bar?It's useful.So it gives us this.And so the result is\nthat phi 0 is equal to,up to an overall normalization\ncoefficient, e to the minusx squared over x0 squared.Solid.So there.We've solved that\ndifferential equation.Is the easiest, second\neasiest differential equation.It's our first\norder differentialequation with a linear term\nrather than a constant.We get a

top of your head?How do you solve what it is?How do we get phi 3?First off, how do we get phi 1?How do we get the next\nstate in the ladder?How do we get the wave function?Raising operator.But what is the\nraising operator?Oh, it's the differential\noperator I take with--OK, but if I had a\ndagger, it's justgoing to change the sign here.So how do I get phi 1?Phi 1 is equal to up\nto some normalization.dx minus 2 over x0\nsquared, x0, phi 0.So now do I have to solve\nthe differential equationto get the higher states?No.I take derivatives and\nmultiply by constants.", "start": 4440.0,

function,and an extremely efficient\nway to write downthe Hermite polynomials.They're the things\nthat you get by actingon this with this operator\nas many times as you want.That is a nice formal definition\nof the Hermite polynomials.The upshot of all of\nthis is the following.The upshot of all this is\nthat we've derived thatwithout ever solving\nthe differentialequation the spectrum just\nfrom that commutation relation,just from that\ncommutation relation--I cannot emphasize\nthis strongly enough--just from the\ncommutation relation,Ea is minus a times the\nconstant, and Ea daggeris a dagger times the constant.We derive that the energy\neigenstates come in a tower.You can move along this tower\nby raising with the raisingoperator, lowering with\nthe lowering operator.You can construct\nthe ground stateby building that simple wave\nfunction, which is annihilatedby the lowering operator.You can build all\nthe other statesby raising them, which is\njust taking derivativesinstead of solving differential\nequations, which is hard.And all of this came from\nthis commutation relation.And since we are going to see\nthis over and over again--and depending on how\nfar you take physics,you will see this in 8.05.You will see this in 8.06.You will see this in\nquantum field theory.This shows up everywhere.It's absolutely at the\ncore of how we organizethe

we're\ngoing to do a review whichis going to introduce a slightly\nmore formal presentation of allthese ideas.That's not going to be\nmaterial covered on the exam,but it's going to help\nyou with the
