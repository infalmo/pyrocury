[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Welcome\nback to recitation.In this video we're going to\ndo another solid of revolutionproblem.So what I'd like to\ndo in this problem isto find the volume of the\nsolid generated by rotatingthe region bounded by the\nfollowing curves: y equals 0,x equal 4, and y equals square\nroot of x, around the line xequals 6.And you can choose your\nfavorite method to do this.What I would like\nfirst, when you'redoing this kind\nof problem, is geta rough sketch of the region.So you have some\npicture of what'sactually going to happen.You don't necessarily need\na three-dimensional picture.But at least have the\ntwo-dimensional regionand understand the where the\nrotation line is, with respectto that region.So I will give you\na little bit of timeto work on that problem.And when I come back I'll\nshow you how I do it.OK, welcome back.So again, what we're\ndoing in this video iswe're going to be looking,\nfinding the volumeof a solid of revolution.And as I mentioned, the\nfirst thing you want to dois get a rough picture\nof what the region lookslike that's being rotated.So I'm going to draw a\nrough sketch of that.Right here.So my axes, here's my x-axis\nand my y-axis, and I will draw,first the curve y equals 0.That's y equals 0.And I'm next going to draw the\ncurve y equals square root of xto make this a little easier for\nmyself, to do that one first.So y equals square root of\nx looks something like this,roughly.And then, x equal 4, because\nit's a very rough sketch,I can just draw\nthis line right hereand say that line's x equal 4.And I want the region bounded\nby those three curves.So, this region right here.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And my rotating line, in\nthis case, is x equals 6.So to give myself\nsome perspective,I remember this is x equals\n4, here's x equals 0.So x equals 6, which\nmay be right about here,I'll draw a dotted line.And I'm going to draw a\nlittle arrow around thereso I know that's the\nline I'm rotating about.Now we notice there's a\nlittle bit of a gap here.But you can actually work on\nthis problem quite simply.If we use the shell\nmethod, we won't haveto worry about the gap at all.We will have to be careful in\nhow we determine our radius.That's actually where you'll\nsee this sort of gap coming up.So when I rotate\nthis around, I'mgoing to get some\nobject that's goingto have a nice curve here.And there's going to be a little\ncut-out, a cylinder missingin the middle when I rotate it.So I'm going to use\nthe shell method.I like the shell method\nfor this problem.You could use the washer\nmethod for this problem,but I like the shells and\nthat's what I'm going to use.So to do the shell method,\nremember we are going to beinterested in 2*pi*r*h.That's really what we need.And now what we\nwant to figure outis, do I want to do this in\nterms of x or in terms of y?All right?When I talk about\nthese shells isit better to think about\nthem as functions of x or y?And it will, you'll\nsee we sort ofhave to think about\nthem in a certain way.So if I draw, let's think about\nif I draw a straight line downand I rotate it\naround the line xequals 6, which I should\nhave labeled here,then I get my shell.So I need these lines\nto go from 0 to 4.I need to have those\nlines go from 0 to 4.And so I see that it's the\nx-value I'm varying over.So I know this is all going to\nbe an integral in terms of x.So let's keep that in mind.So r I should write as a\nfunction of x, and h I shouldwrite as a function of x.So if I examined this\nsegment again here,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "the height is fairly simple.Because what is this curve?This is the curve y\nequals square root of x.So the height is just\nsquare root of x.So h is equal to\nsquare root of x.And so now I just\nneed r in terms of x.Well let's look at\nthis segment again.It's just a generic position.How would I find that radius?What is the radius?Well I'm going to draw the\nthree-dimensional picture overhere.That that's this\ncurve, this segment,rotated about the\nline x equals 6.Right?And the radius is not x.It's the distance from x\nequals 6 to my segment.That's an important distinction\nwe should understand.If we come back and\nlook at this picture,this is not the radius.Right?The radius is the distance from\nthis value to this value in x.And how do I measure that?Well that's fairly\nstraightforward.That's the difference in x\nvalues between these two.The x value here is 6.And the x value here,\nthis is a generic x.So the difference, the\ndistance, is just 6 minus x.Right?This is just a simple case\nof the distance formula.Because I'm not interested\nin the changes in y, at all.I'm just interested in the\ndifference between these twox values.So it's simply 6 minus x.That's our radius.So now I have the\nradius in terms of x.And I have the\nheight in terms of x.So I can completely\nset up my integral.So let me come a\nlittle bit further overand set up the integral.So I know I'm\nintegrating-- we evensaid what we were integrating\nfrom and to already.I'm starting x at 0.And I'm stopping\nit at x equal 4.And then I want to\nintegrate 2*pi*r*h.So I'll put the\n2*pi out in front.The radius is 6 minus x.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And the height is\nsquare root of x.And then I'm integrating\nit all in dx.And at this point,\nsolving the problemis fairly straightforward.I can write square root\nof x as x to the 1/2to make myself feel a\nlittle better about it.I can then distribute.And then I just use the power\nrule to do the integrationand evaluate to get an actual\nnumber, to get that volume.So I'm going to go\nback and just makesure we remember what\nall the pieces areand that we feel\ncomfortable with doingthis type of problem.And I'll let you\nfinish and evaluatethat if you would like\nto know an actual number.So let's come back over.We were finding the volume\nof a solid generatedby rotating a certain region\naround the line x equals 6.The way this might be\ndifferent from someof the problems\nyou've seen before,is it's not the x or y axis.And the region has a gap.The region is not connected\nto the line of rotation.So if we come to\nsee our picture,we can see that clearly.The rotating region\nis the blue region.The line of rotation\nis the dotted line.So there's a little\nbit of a gap there.I let you pick your\nfavorite method.I chose shells,\nbecause I didn't haveto worry about subtracting off\npieces, this little piece here.It was inherent in\nthe radius, the wayI determined the radius and\nthe x values that I chose.So I used shell method.And so how did I, I had to\nfigure out a couple things.I had to figure out\nfirst, what variableI was doing this in, x or y.And then I had to figure\nout the radius and heightin terms of that variable.You figure out what variable\nyou need by saying, OKif I'm doing shells, I'm looking\nat these kinds of segments.And I'm varying\nthe x-values, then,as I move and look at\nthose different segments.So I know that this is\na dx type of problem.I know I'm integrating\nsomething in x.So then I have to find radius\nand height in terms of x.The height's the freebie.It's just from 0\nup to the function.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "The radius is maybe\na little harder.But that's still\njust the distancebetween the line of rotation\nand the point where you are.And so that's 6 minus x.And then I just set up\nthe integral from there.So that's really\nwhat the idea isin doing these\ntypes of problems.And because we get to pick\nour simplest way, for meit was shells.Maybe you picked washers.But for me, this problem,\nthe simplest way is shells.So I guess that's\nwhere I'll stop.", "start":
