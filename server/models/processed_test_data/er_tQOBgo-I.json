[{"text": "JOEL LEWIS: Hi.Welcome back to recitation.Today I wanted to talk\nabout something that'smentioned in the notes but\nwasn't covered in lecturebecause of the exam review.So this is, the subject is\nhyperbolic trig functions.So first I just wanted to define\nthem for you and graph themso we can get a little\nbit of a feeling for whatthese functions are\nlike, and then I'mgoing to explain to you why\nthey have the words hyperbolicand trig in their names.So these are some\ninteresting functions.They're not, they don't--\naren't quite as importantas your usual, sort of\ncircular trig functions.But yeah, so let me introduce\nthem and let me jumpin just with their definition.So there are two\nmost important ones.Just like a regular\ntrigonometric functionsthere's the sine and\nthe cosine and thenyou can write the other\nfour trigonometric functionsin terms of them.So for hyperbolic\ntrig functions wehave the hyperbolic cosine\nand the hyperbolic sine.So the notation here,\nwe write c o s h.So the h for hyperbolic.So hyperbolic cosine.And usually we\npronounce this \"cosh.\"And similarly, for\nthe hyperbolic sinewe write s i n h,\nfor hyperbolic sine,except in the reverse order.And we usually pronounce this\n\"sinch,\" so in American Englishas if there were an\nextra c in there.Sinch.OK.So these functions have\nfairly simple definitionsin terms of the exponential\nfunction, e to the x.So cosh of x is defined to be e\nto the x plus e to the minus xdivided by 2.And sinh of x is defined to be\ne to x minus e to the minus xdivided by 2.So if you remember what\nyour graph of e to the xlooks like, and your\ngraph of e to the minus x,it's not hard to see that the\ngraphs of cosh x and sinh xshould look sort of like this.So for cosh x, so we see as\nx gets big, so e to the minus", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.259}, {"text": "x is going to 0.It's not very important.So it mostly is driven\nby this e to the x part.And as x gets negative and\nbig, then this is going to 0and this is getting\nlarger and larger.So we got something\nthat looks like this.So it looks a little\nbit, in this pictureit looks a little\nbit like a parabola,but the growth here is\nexponential at both sides.So in fact, this is growing\nmuch, much, much fasterthan, say, 1 plus x squared.So it's a much steeper curve.OK.And it reaches its\nminimum here at xequals 0-- it has the\nvalue 1 plus 1 over 2.So its minimum there\nis at x equals 0,it has its minimum value 1.For sinh, OK, so we're taking\nthe difference of them.So it's similar when x\nis positive and large,e to the x is big,\nand e to the minusx is pretty small,\nalmost negligible.So we got exponential\ngrowth off that side.When x becomes\nnegative and large,e to the x is going to 0, e to\nthe minus x is becoming large,but it's-- we've got\na minus sign here.So as x goes to minus\ninfinity, this curvegoes also to minus infinity.And again, the growth here\nis exponential in both cases.And if you were curious, say\nabout what the slope thereat the origin is, you could\nquickly take a derivativeand check that that's passing\nthrough the origin with slope 1there.OK.So this is a sort\nof basic pictureof what these curves look like.They have some nice properties,\nand let me talk about them.So for example,\none nice thing youmight notice about\nthese functionsis that it's easy to\ncompute their derivatives.Right?So if we look at d/dx of cosh\nx, in order to compute that,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.204}, {"text": "well, just look at the\ndefinition of cosh.So it's really just a sum of\ntwo exponential functions.Exponential functions are\neasy to take the derivatives.Take the derivative of e to\nthe x, you get e to the x.Take the derivative of e to\nthe minus x, well, OK, soit's a little chain rule, so\nyou get a minus 1 in front.So the derivative of cosh x is\ne to the x minus e to the minusx over 2.But we have a name for this.This is actually just sinh x.So the derivative\nof cosh is sinh,and the derivative\nof sinh, well, OK.You look at the same\nthing, take this formula,take its derivative.Well, e to the x, take its\nderivative, you get e to the x.e to the minus x,\ntake its derivative,you get minus e to the minus\nx, so those two minus signscancel out and become a plus.So this is e to the x plus\ne to the minus x over 2,which is cosh x.So here you have\nsome behavior that'sa little bit reminiscent of\nthe behavior of trig functions.Right?For trig functions, if you\ntake the derivative of sineyou get cosine.And if you take the\nderivative of cosineyou almost get back sine,\nbut you get minus sine.So here you don't have\nthat extra negative signfloating around.Right?So you, when you take\nthe derivative of coshyou get sinh on the nose.No minus sign needed.So that's interesting.But the real reason\nthat these havethe words trig in their name is\nactually a little bit deeper.So let me come over here\nand draw a couple pictures.So the normal trig\nfunctions-- what sometimes wecall the circular trig functions\nif we want to distinguish themfrom the hyperbolic trig\nfunctions-- they're closely--so circular trig\nfunctions, they'reclosely related to\nthe unit circle.So the unit circle\nhas equation x squared", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.155}, {"text": "plus y squared equals 1.It's a circle.Well, close enough, right?And what is the\nnice relationshipbetween this circle\nand the trig functions?Well, if you choose any\npoint on this circle,then there exists\nsome value of tsuch that this point\nhas coordinatescosine t comma sine t.Now it happens\nthat the value of tis actually the angle\nthat that radius makeswith the positive axis.But not going to worry\nabout that right now.It's not the key idea of import.So as t varies through\nthe real numbers,the point cosine t,\nsine t, that variesand it just goes\naround this curve.So it traces out\nthis circle exactly.So the hyperbolic\ntrig functions show upin a very similar situation.But instead of\nlooking at the unitcircle, what we\nwant to look at isthe unit rectangular hyperbola.So what do I mean by that?Well, so instead of\ntaking the equationx squared plus y squared\nequals 1, which gives a circle,I'm going to look at a\nvery similar equation thatgives a hyperbola.So this is the equation\nx squared minus y squaredequals 1.So if you if you graph this\nequation, what you'll seeis that, well, it passes\nthrough the point (1, 0).And then we've got\none branch here,we've got a little\nasymptote there.So it's got a right\nbranch like that,and also it's symmetric\nacross the y-axis.So there's a symmetric\nleft branch here.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So this is the graph\nof the equationx squared minus y\nsquared equals 1.So it's this hyperbola.Now what I claim is\nthat cosh and sinh havethe same relationship to this\nhyperbola as cosine and sinehave to the circle.Well, so I'm fudging\na little bit.So it turns out it's only the\nright half of the hyperbola.So what do I mean by that?Well, here's what\nI'd like to do.Set x equals-- so we're going\nto introduce a new variable,u-- I'm going to set x equal\ncosh u and y equals sinh u.And I'm going to\nlook at the quantityx squared minus y squared.So x squared minus y squared.So this is, so we use\nmost of the same notationsfor hyperbolic trig\nfunctions that wedo for regular trig functions.So this is cosh squared\nu minus sinh squared u.And now we can plug in the\nformulas for cosh and sinhthat we have.So this is equal to e to the u\nplus e to the minus u over 2,quantity squared, minus e to\nthe u minus e to the minusu over 2, quantity squared.And now we can expand\nout both of these factorsand-- both of these squares,\nrather, and put them together.So over 2 squared is\nover 4 and we square thisand we get e to the 2u.OK, so then we get 2 times e to\nthe u times e to the minus u.But e to the u times e to the\nminus u is just 1, so plus 2.Plus e to the minus 2u minus\ne to the 2u minus 2 plus eto the minus 2u-- so same\nthing over here-- over 4.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "OK, so the e to the 2u's cancel\nand the e to the minus 2u'scancel and we're left\nwith 2 minus minus 2.That's 4.So this is 4 over 4,\nso this is equal to 1.OK.So if x is equal to cosh u\nand y is equal to sinh u,then x squared minus y\nsquared is equal to 1.So if we choose a point\n(cosh u, sinh u) for some u,that point lies\non this hyperbola.That's what this says.That this point-- OK, so\nthe point (cosh u, sinh u)is somewhere on this hyperbola.And what's also true is the\nsort of reverse statement.If you look at all such points,\nif you let u vary and look--through the real\nnumbers and you askwhat happens to this\npoint (cosh u, sinh u),the answers is that it\ntraces out the right halfof this hyperbola.If you go back to the\ngraph of y equals cosh x,you'll see that the hyperbolic\ncosine function is alwayspositive.So we can't-- over here, we\ncan't trace out this leftbranch where x is negative.Although it's easy\nenough to say what doestrace out this left branch.Since it's just\nthe mirror image,this is traced out by\nminus cosh u comma sinh u.So there's a-- so the\nhyperbolic trig functions havethe same relationship to\nthis branch of this hyperbolathat the regular trig\nfunctions have to the circle.So there's where the words\nhyperbolic and trig functionscome from.So let me say one\nmore thing about them,which is that we\nsaw that they havethis analogy with\nregular trig functions.Right?So instead of satisfying\ncosine squaredplus sine squared equals 1, they\nsatisfy cosh squared minus sinhsquared equals 1.And instead of satisfying\nthe derivative of sineequals cosine and the derivative\nof cosine equals minus sine,", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "they satisfy derivative\nof cosh equalssinh and derivative\nof sinh equals cosh.So similar relationships.Not exactly the\nsame, but similar.So this is true of a lot\nof trig relationships,that there's a corresponding\nformula for the hyperbolic trigfunctions.So one example of such\na formula is your--for example, your angle\naddition formulas.So I'm going to just leave\nthis is an exercise for you.So let me, I guess\nI'll just stick itin this funny little\npiece of board right here.So, exercise.Find sinh of x plus y and cosh\nof x plus y in terms of sinhx, cosh x, sinh y, and cosh y.So in other words, find\nthe corresponding formulato the angle addition\nformula in that caseof the hyperbolic\ntrig functions.So I'll leave you with that.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}]
