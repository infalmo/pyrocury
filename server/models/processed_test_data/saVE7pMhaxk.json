and it'spretty close to to the spectrum withwhatever colors uh i hadnowthe the visible range as we all knowextends from about 4 500 angstroms toabout 6500 angstroms in the in the redwhich is about what two thousandangstroms or soand that's that's the visibleessentially that's the visible rangenow when we compareuh light sourcesto this to this range for example thespectral lamp that has a very

angstromokay or 0.1 angstroms orin terms of uh frequency it's uh 10 10gigahertzand then you can getsome lamps that have smaller line widthsor you can even get them with broaderline width depending on on theconditions of the discharge and so onand when we come to to lasersthe line width is extremely narrow thespectral width is extremely narrow andit can be in the megahertzbut can also be in the

to take my word for it let'ssee how you might measure it well if youtook a typical spectral lamp here andthen collect some of the light from itand put it into a spectrometer or someother devicedevice that measures the spectrum thenwhat you get you get a plot like thisintensity versus wavelength and here youcan either plot wavelength or you canplot frequency depending onthe kind of work you doand then you'll see some blob like thisand it has a certain width over whichthe the the source radiates and we callit either delta lambda for the width oror delta fnowwhen we compare it with awith a laser

isextremely narrow and we see thatelectrical oscillators all the time andwe don't even think about itnownow i would like totell you a little bit about how anoscillator is madeand once we understand oscillators madethen we can extend it to to the opticaldomain and and then be able to explainhow a laser works okay so let's reviewsome background here in in oscillatorswell there are all kinds of uhoscillators i'm going to start with witha pendulumhere's a simple pendulum length length dand i let it i let it swingwhat does it do when i let it swing wellit will go backwards and forwards justlike this willgenerate an oscillation here of thependulum which will die downand the frequency of this oscillation isgiven by1 over 2 pi the square root ofg the acceleration of gravity divided byd the length of the of the pendulumnowthe uh so the thelonger d is thesmaller the the frequency of oscillationbut but as we can see this oscillationdies down and the question why does itdie down well why does it die downbecause there are some lossesand the losses for example come in thispivot here comes pushing air around andso on but basically it will die downbecause it's difficult to get rid ofall these losses so we don't have thatconstant oscillation that i showed youbeforenow we go to the frequency domainreminding you what we did before becausei have a dying oscillation like thisthen if the time constant is is tauthen the line width is going to beapproximately uh delta f which is", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.985}, {"text": "approximately one over tauand and that is proportional directlyproportional to the losses the higherthe losses the largerlarger is the line width and the shorteris the uh the uhthe decay timeall right so thatif i improve the losses if i reduce thelosses then i can get this to narrowdown and i can get this to last to lastuh longernow the umif i as i just mentioned just now thisis in in pictorial form if i reduce thelosses if i'm clever in reducing thefriction in this pivot and so on i canmake the wave lastlonger and this width getsgets narrower but in order to make itconstant amplitude i have to dosomething elseall right this is what i have to do ihave to call on this fellow here to topush on this pendulum to push on thispendulum so thatit stops it from fromdying down in a way what this fellow isdoing by doing his pushing at the righttime it's really overcoming the losseswhether at the the pivot here or pushingair around and and so on so in orderinstead of having just the dyingoscillation like this where i end upwith a constant amplitude because ofthis fellow here is putting energy intothis system and compensating forso as the amplitude here becomes becomesconstant then the line width herestarts the delta f starts to shrink andgoes close to zero so in this way iproduce a an oscillator and in this caseof course it's a it's a pendulumoscillator that's used like a clock andand so on but i do needthis energy source this person here toovercome to overcome the lossesnow this is not the only type of uh ofoscillator i have all kindsuh let's say i have a mass spring systemi can make that into oscillator let's", "start":

going to be a dyingoscillation like this because of wellfrictionmass friction has a friction between thefriction between the mass and and thestable and losses in the spring and soon the frequency here will be determinedby thesquare root of the of the springconstant k and divided by the massif i change the mass i change thefrequency and and so on and so so againjust like in the pendulum it's a dyingoscillation and has a in the frequencydomain has a certain width and the widthis proportional toone overone over tau and that's againproportional to lossesif i look at a stretch stringhere straight string if i hit it then itit bobs up and down here in the middleand then the frequency will bedetermined by the speed of sound in thematerial divided by by twice theseparation between the ends and again itdies down okay this bubbling up and downwill die downbecause again of losses and also we'llhave we'll have a widthand then finally here if i have an lccircuitinductor in a capacitor again if i if iinject a pulse into it i see that againi get an oscillation if i look let's saythe voltage across the capacitor here ihave this oscillation that dies downand the frequency is given by in thiscase by the square root of 1 over lc lbeing the inductor c is the is the valueof the capacitanceand the this decay is due to losses nowin electrical circuit where the lossescome from well they
