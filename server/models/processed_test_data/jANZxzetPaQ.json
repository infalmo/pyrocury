[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Very good.So it's time to start.So today, I want to talk about\ngeneral features of quantummechanics.Quantum mechanics is something\nthat takes some time to learn,and we're going to be doing some\nof that learning this semester.But I want to give you a\nperspective of where we'regoing, what are the\nbasic features, howquantum mechanics looks,\nwhat's surprising about it,and introduce some\nideas that willbe relevant throughout\nthis semester and somethat will be relevant for\nlater courses as well.So it's an overview\nof quantum mechanics.So quantum mechanics,\nat this moment,is almost 100 years old.Officially-- and we will hear--this year, in 2016, we're\ncelebrating the centenaryof general relativity.And when will the centenary\nof quantum mechanics be?I'm pretty sure it\nwill be in 2025.Because in 1925,\nSchrodinger and Heisenbergpretty much wrote down the\nequations of quantum mechanics.But quantum mechanics\nreally begins earlier.The routes that led to quantum\nmechanics began in the lateyears of the 19th century\nwith work of Planck,and then at the\nbeginning of the century,with work of Einstein and\nothers,m as we will see todayand in the next few lectures.So the thoughts, the\npuzzles, the ideasthat led to quantum\nmechanics begin before 1925,and in 1925, it\nsuddenly happened.So what is quantum mechanics?", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.199}, {"text": "Quantum mechanics is really\na framework to do physics,as we will understand.So quantum physics has\nreplaced classical physicsas the correct description\nof fundamental theory.So classical physics may\nbe a good approximation,but we know that at some\npoint, it's not quite right.It's not only not\nperfectly accurate.It's conceptually very\ndifferent from the way thingsreally work.So quantum physics has\nreplaced classical physics.And quantum physics\nis the principlesof quantum mechanics applied to\ndifferent physical phenomena.So you have, for example,\nquantum electrodynamics,which is quantum mechanics\napplied to electromagnetism.You have quantum\nchromodynamics, whichis quantum mechanics applied\nto the strong interaction.You have quantum optics when\nyou apply quantum mechanicsto photons.You have quantum\ngravity when youtry to apply quantum\nmechanics to gravitation.Why the laughs?And that's what gives rise\nto string theory, whichis presumably a quantum\ntheory of gravity,and in fact, the quantum\ntheory of all interactionsif it is correct.Because it not only\ndescribes gravity,but it describes\nall other forces.So quantum mechanics\nis the framework,and we apply it to many things.So what are we going\nto cover today?What are we going to review?Essentially five topics--\none, the linearityof quantum mechanics, two, the\nnecessity of complex numbers,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "three, the laws of\ndeterminism, four,the unusual features\nof superposition,and finally, what\nis entanglement.So that's what we\naim to discuss today.So we'll begin with\nnumber one, linearity.And that's a very\nfundamental aspectof quantum mechanics,\nsomething that we haveto pay a lot of attention to.So whenever you\nhave a theory, youhave some dynamical variables.These are the variables\nyou want to findtheir values because they are\nconnected with observation.If you have dynamical\nvariables, youcan compare the values\nof those variables,or some values deduced\nfrom those variables,to the results of an experiment.So you have the equations\nof motion, so linearity.We're talking linearity.You have some equations\nof motion, EOM.And you have\ndynamical variables.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "If you have a theory,\nyou have some equations,and you have to solve for\nthose dynamical variables.And the most famous example\nof a theory that is linearis Maxwell's theory\nof electromagnetism.Maxwell's theory\nof electromagnetismis a linear theory.What does that mean?Well, first, practically,\nwhat it meansis that if you have a solution--for example, a plane wave\npropagating in this direction--and you have another solution--a plane wave propagating\ntowards you--then you can form\na third solution,which is two plane waves\npropagating simultaneously.And you don't have\nto change anything.You can just put them together,\nand you get a new solution.The two waves propagate\nwithout touching each other,without affecting each other.And together, they\nform a new solution.This is extraordinarily\nuseful in practicebecause the air\naround us is filledwith electromagnetic waves.All your cell phones send\nelectromagnetic wavesup the sky to satellites\nand radio stationsand transmitting stations, and\nthe millions of phone callsgo simultaneously without\naffecting each other.A transatlantic cable can\nconduct millions of phone callsat the same time, and as much\ndata and video and internet.It's all superposition.All these millions\nof conversationsgo simultaneously\nthrough the cablewithout interfering\nwith each other.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Mathematically, we have\nthe following situation.In Maxwell's theory, you\nhave an electric field,a magnetic field, a charge\ndensity, and a current density.That's charge per unit\narea per unit of time.That's the current density.And this set of data\ncorrespond to a solutionif they satisfy\nMaxwell's equations,which is a set of equations\nfor the electromagnetic field,charged densities,\nand current density.So suppose this is a solution,\nthat you verify that itsolves Maxwell's equation.Then linearity\nimplies the following.You multiply this by alpha,\nalpha e, alpha b, alpha rho,and alpha j.And think of this as\nthe new electric field,the new magnetic field,\nthe new charged density,and the new current\nis also a solution.If this is a solution,\nlinearity impliesthat you can\nmultiply those valuesby a number, a constant number,\na alpha being a real number.And this is still a solution.It also implies more.Linearity means\nanother thing as well.It means that if you have two\nsolutions, e1, b1, rho 1, j1,", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and e2, b2, rho 2, j2--if these are two\nsolutions, then linearityimplies that the sum e1 plus e2,\nb1 plus b2, rho 1 plus rho 2,and j1 plus j2 is\nalso a solution.So that's the meaning, the\ntechnical meaning of linearity.We have two solutions.We can add them.We have a single solution.You can scale it by a number.Now, I have not shown\nyou the equationsand what makes them linear.But I can explain this\na little more as towhat does it mean to\nhave a linear equation.Precisely what do we mean\nby a linear equation?So a linear equation.And we write it schematically.We try to avoid details.We try to get\nacross the concept.A linear equation, we write\nthis l u equal 0 whereu is your unknown and l is what\nis called the linear operator,", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.101}, {"text": "something that acts on u.And that thing, the equation,\nis of the form l and u equal 0.Now, you might say,\nOK, that alreadylooks to me a little strange,\nbecause you have just oneunknown, and here we\nhave several unknowns.So this is not very general.And you could have\nseveral equations.Well, that won't change much.We can have several\nlinear operatorsif you have several equations,\nlike l1 or something,l2 on something, all\nthese ones equal to 0as you have several equations.So you can have several\nu's or several unknowns,and you could say something\nlike you have l on u, v,w equals 0 where you\nhave several unknowns.But it's easier to just\nthink of this first.And once you understand this,\nyou can think about the casewhere you have many equations.So what is a linear equation?It's something in which this l--the unknown can\nbe anything, but lmust have important properties,\nas being a linear operatorwill mean that l on a times\nu, where a is a number,should be equal to alu and l\non u1 plus u2 on two unknownsis equal to lu 1 lu 2.This is what we mean by\nthe operator being linear.So if an operator\nis linear, you alsohave l on alpha u1 plus beta u2.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.292}, {"text": "You apply first the second\nproperty, l on the first plusl on the second.So this is l of alpha\nu1 plus l of beta u2.And then using the\nfirst property,this is alpha l of\nu1 plus beta l of u2.And then you realize that\nif u1 and u2 are solutions--which means lu 1\nequal lu 2 equals 0if they solve the equation--then alpha u1 plus\nbeta u2 is a solution.Because if lu1 is 0 and lu2 is\n0, l of alpha u1 plus beta u2is 0, and it is a solution.So this is how we write\na linear equation.Now, an example\nprobably would help.If I have the\ndifferential equationdu dt plus 1 over\ntau u equals 0,I can write it as an\nequation of the form luequals 0 by taking\nl on u to be definedto be vu vt plus 1 over tau u.Now, it's pretty much--", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.279}, {"text": "I haven't done much here.I've just said, look, let's\ndefine l [? active ?] [? on ?]u to be this.And then certainly, this\nequation is just lu equals 0.The question would be maybe\nif somebody would tell youhow do you write l alone--well, l alone, probably\nwe should write itas d dt without anything\nhere plus 1 over tau.Now, that's a way\nyou would writeit to try to understand\nyourself what's going on.And you say, well, then when\nl acts as the variable u,the first term takes\nthe derivative,and the second term, which is\na number, just multiplies it.So you could write\nl as this thing.And now it is\nstraightforward to checkthat this is a linear operator.l is linear.And for that, you have to\ncheck the two properties there.So for example, l on\nau would be ddt of auplus 1 over tau au,\nwhich is a times du d tauplus 1 over tau u, which is alu.And you can check.I asked you to check\nthe other propertyl on u1 plus u2 is\nequal to lu 1 plus lu 2.Please do it.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}]
