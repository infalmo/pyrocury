guess you still hopefullyare in the right\nplace, because we'regoing to have a good\ntime this semester.My name is Gary Gensler.I'm a Senior Lecturer\nhere at MIT Sloan.I'm also an advisor over\nat the MIT Media Lab.And I've spent a lifetime\naround the world of finance,and money, and public policy.And I've been at MIT\nthis last eight months.And we're going to\nlearn a lot togetherabout blockchain and money.We're going to have\na little bit of funhere and see what\nwe're going to do.So we're talking about\nblockchain and money.That's where we are.By the way, I do cold call.I do call on you-- so if\nyou want to leave now,I understand--because I want to have an\ninteraction a little bitabout it.So my first question\nfor the class,for everyone, whether registered\nor not, how many of youhave ever owned\na cryptocurrency?Wait, wait, let's see.It seems like it's\nabout 45% of you or so.All right, so it gives me--Alin you want to keep\nyour hand up long?And how many of you\nhave ever workedon any blockchain-related\nprojects,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.418}, {"text": "in an entrepreneurial setting,\na corporate setting, anywhere?All right, good, so about\na third in the

lecture\nreally is, what is blockchain?And why might it be a catalyst?And I emphasize the word \"might\"\nit be a catalyst for changein the world of finance.We could talk a lot\nabout things outsideof the world of finance.And blockchain may indeed have\na lot of applications outsideof finance, but\nI've chosen to tryto just narrow the scope a bit.So this semester is really\nabout blockchain and moneyor blockchain and finance.And secondly, you\nwill see index cardson every one of\nthese round tables.One assignment, by\nthe end of the class--you could do it now or later--I would like each of\nyou to anonymously writeon the card what you want\nto achieve in this semester.It could be anything\nfrom this class,from learning about blockchain,\nfrom making money on Bitcoin,from--I don't care if you tell me\nit's meeting your future spouse.Like, what do you want\nto achieve in this class?I can't help you\non the third, but Iwill try to help you on the\nthings I can help you on.And

about, well,what is blockchain?What is it really about?Well, the internet started many\ndecades ago, before most of youwere born, but 1974-ish.I mean, there is\nsome predecessorseven from the late '60s, the\nethernet, which is reallyhow two computers communicate.And then you had\nTCP/IP, which was reallythe internet protocol of\nmultiple computers compute--talking to each other.And then later

a\nparticular text suchthat it's not readable\nby someone elsewithout having the\ndecryption code.GARY GENSLER: OK, so it's\nhow do you encrypt somethingso it's not\ndetectable by others.Or in essence,\nit's communicationsin the presence of adversaries.You have an adversary who\nwants the communication.You want to communicate and\nnot let your adversariesknow that communication.And this is true\nfor ancient times.So in ancient times, there was\nsomething called the cipher.And this was a way that\nyou'd take a piece of leatheror a piece of cloth and\nhave a lot of letters.And both sides,

1930s before theyfell to the Germans.And Turing built on all of\nthat and cracked it further.And then in the 1970s--and this was here at\nMIT, to some extent--there is private-key\npublic-key

we'll read Nick Szabo's\nis a piece on smart contractslater, Adam Back who\ncreated Hashcash.Some of these innovations were\nwhat Satoshi Nakamoto laterused.Some innovations which were\nreally helpful and workedwere Alipay and M-Pesa.Does anybody know\nwhat M-Pesa is?AUDIENCE: I think it's\nused in Kenya as, like,mobile cellular-enabled cash.GARY GENSLER: Right.In essence, they\nfound out in Kenya--this was 10, 12 years\nago-- that peoplewere trading mobile minutes.They were unbanked, but\nthey had cellular phones.And they were trading their\nminutes as a form of currency.And Safaricom

still unbanked,but half of that half\nhas mobile phones.M-Pesa has 20 million\ncustomers in Kenya right now.So it's a form of\nmoney that's kindof swapping mobile minutes.But the riddle remained, how

insurance,\nthat's a transference of risk.When you buy an equity stock,\nthat's a transference of risk.If you enter into a complex\ncredit default swap,that's a transference of risk.So finance is not just\nthe movement of money.It's the movement of risk as\nwell, throughout the economy.And I always think,\nfinance, I always--I've thought this when I was\nat Goldman Sachs for 18 years--that finance

peoplein this world who are unbanked.And so we don't think of\nit as much in the developedcountries, but it's certainly\ntrue in many productseven here in the US.And these are, to me,\nthe

Securities\nand Exchange Commissionsays, you do about 30,000\ntransactions a second,but we need you to scale.And your computers\nand everythinghave to be resilient to\n100,000 transactions a second.Bitcoin, you can do about\nseven transactions a second.Visa currently-- it\ndepends on the second--does anywhere from 20,000\nto 70,000 a second.So it's just a sense of\nscalability and performance.We might get there.It might be three\nto seven years away.I'm optimistic,\nbut there is stilla bunch of performance\nand scalability issues.Privacy and security--\nblockchains, by their nature,are public.So they're not fully\ncensorship-resistant,but there is a lot of innovation\nabout making them more private.But then that makes the public\nsector a little

briefly.Permissioned blockchains\nhave a known group of peoplewho actually participate.The half of you that said\nyou've owned Bitcoin,you know it to be\nsomething whereanybody can update the ledger.Permissioned blockchains, you\ncan't do that, in essence.You pick the 3 or 20.The Australian Stock Exchange\nis updating their clearingand settling.They announced they're\ndoing a blockchain

Commission.But this course is\nnot about regulation,though we have to always\ncome back to regulation.We always have to\ninfuse what we'redoing with the regulation.But let me just give\nyou a little framework.And then you'll have to be\nbored in a handful of weeksand read--I gave some congressional\ntestimony on it.Yes, it will be\nrequired reading, sorry.But it's guarding\nagainst illicit activity.A lot of Bitcoin\nand cryptocurrenciesstarted out in the\ncyber punk sortof movement and libertarian\nmovement, so forth.And it is true.You can use this for illicit\nactivity, absolutely.But I would say,\ncrime is not new,just the mechanisms\nand means are new.And so the criminals,\nyes, will use thisand have used it for\nillicit activity.Financial stability-- central\nbankers around the globe,sort of will this shake finance?Well, it's only $200 billion.The financial markets\nare $300 trillion plus--not yet, is generally\nwhat they're saying.But for some\ncountries, it's a wayto get around capital controls.And so for those countries\nworried about capital controls,it's a very real and\nlive set of issues.", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "And then protecting\nthe

C cell classes,\nor Media Lab classes,this is a very unsettled\narea of public policy.So it makes it interesting.And if you all go off\nand form companies,you will actually\nbe helping sortof set the edge of that\npublic policy debate.I would always say,\njust remember poetRiley, the duck test.This is a poet,\nIndiana poet-- so thosethat aren't from the US\nmight not know the duck test.But basically, if it\nquacks like a duckand it walks like a\nduck, it's a duck.So whenever you're thinking\nabout public policy, folkslike myself who once\nwas a regulator,we think in the duck test.And then we secondarily\nthink about the actual wordsin the congressional act.Where is the common sense?And if it quacks and\nwalks like a duck,it's probably a security.Or it's probably this or that.The incumbents, like this\nlioness in the corner,are eyeing this space, because\nthere is a lot of volatility.And Wall Street makes\nmoney on volatility.Volatility is the\nfriend of Wall Street.It may not be the\nfriend of investors,but it's a friend\nof Wall Street.And they also like the trading\nvolumes and the spreads.Coinbase, the largest crypto\nexchange here in the US,has 20 million accounts.They

more\nwilling to beg for forgivenessfrom regulators.They're willing to sort of take\nrisks and beg for forgiveness,whereas incumbents tend to\nhave to ask for permission.So there is an unlevel\nfield,
