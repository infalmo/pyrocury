[{"text": "- Hello and welcome to Khan\nAcademy live SAT class.My name is Eric, I'm an SAT tutorand one of the SAT experts\nhere at Khan Academy.This is class number two of threethat we have planned for the\nSAT over the next few weeksand I'm very excited to be\ncovering SAT Reading today.Before we jump into SAT Reading,I want to give you a preview\nof what we're going to covertoday and next week, let's take a look.So last week we covered SAT\nMath, in our first class,and if you missed that class, don't worry,we recorded it and you can\nfind it on our YouTube channelso go ahead and check that\nout if you're interestedand today, like I mentioned,\nwe're gonna cover SAT Readingand then the following week,\nwe'll cover SAT Writingand all of these classes\nwill be at the same times,so Thursday, they'll all be on Thursdaysat 7pm Eastern, 4pm Pacific,so these are all the classes\nthat we'll have plannedand for today, let's take a lookat what we'll cover for SAT Reading.So for today's class, the first 25 minutesI'll spend giving some instructionand doing some practice problems together.Specifically, I'm going\nto introduce a strategycalled Rephrase & Predict,which is a more proactive approach,that you can use for SAT Reading questionsthat I found really helpfuland that many students\nfind helpful to try.Next, I'll cover Words in Context problemsand Command of Evidence problems as welland we'll do some practice\nproblems together.Then, in the next 10 minutes,I will answer some student questions,and so at that point, you'll have a chanceto add comments in YouTube\nand I'll try and answeras many questions as I can\nin the time that I have,I'll give out the Khan\nAcademy badge and all of thatand then in the last 25 minutes,you'll practice what you've\nlearned on Khan Academyand just like last class, we have a number", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.429}, {"text": "of Khan Academy and College\nBoard experts availableto help you while you have questions.Unlike last class, after\nthe instruction and Q&A,I'll sign off and you'll just headto Khan Academy to practice.You won't need to come back\nto YouTube this time aroundso you'll spend 35 minutes on YouTubeand then, in the next\n25 minutes, practice,do reading problems and we'll be thereto help via one-on-one chat.So, let's take a look at\nwhat we're gonna coverand get started.So why are we talking about proactivereading strategies today?Well, let me pose a few questionsand let me know if any\nof these sound familiaror if you've ever been in\nthis kind of situation before.So, have you ever read the answer choicesand thought, well, all of these look good,and, you know, you're kind of stuck there?Or, maybe you get the\nquestion down to two choicesbut then end up picking the wrong one,or you're always 50-50 and\nnot sure which one to pick?Or maybe you're like I\nwas, when I first startedpracticing for the SAT Readingand maybe you run out of time\non the SAT Reading section?Well, that's why we're chattingabout the Rephrase & Predict strategy.So this strategy is one that I foundthat was really helpful for meand helpful for a number of studentsand so, I'd recommend giving it a try,it's certainly not the\nonly way to approachSAT Reading questions but it's,it can be really helpful\nonce you get the hang of it,when you are approaching\nSAT Reading questions.So this strategy really focuseson coming up with your own\nanswer to reading questionsbefore you look at the answer choices.So this is the most important word, beforeand there are really two parts,so this first part, involves,is called the Rephrase portionand this part involves\nreading the question", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "but covering the answer choicesand this is really important,so that you don't distract yourselfwith the answer choices up frontand then if possible,\nrephrase the questioninto a how, what or why question,and this can really help\nsimplify the questionto put it in your own words\nand can just make surethat you understand the\nquestion before you move on.The next step in this\nstrategy is to predictand so you would start by reviewingthe relevant parts of the passage,so go back and re-read\na little bit before,a little bit after where you need toand then, based on\nthat, predict the answerto the question in your own wordsand so if the question is askingthe author's purpose in paragraph two is,you would actually say, in your own words,well I think it was to\nintroduce amphibiansas a relevant population\nfor this biological study,so you would say something\nin your own wordsto answer the question.Then, and only then, would\nyou uncover the answer choicesand then start crossing out the choicesthat don't match your predictionand select the choice that best matches,and so, instead of a different approachof reading the question,\nlooking at the answer choicesand then evaluating one by one,you come up with your own prediction firstand then that really can helpwhen you do finally look\nat the answer choicesand it can help you hone in on the onesthat match your prediction and\nare supported by the passageand eliminate the ones\nthat might look plausiblebut once you have that\nprediction in your mindof, oh, well, I think the\nanswer is this amphibian thing,it's easier to do that matchingand to hone in on the right question.So let's take a look\nat what this looks likefor a practice problem now,just to make it a little\nmore tangible and real.So, step one, if you're\nwatching from home,is to take your hand, right\nhand, left hand, whichever oneand cover up answer choices A through D,", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "so go ahead and cover\nup those answer choicesand now, we'll do the Rephrase\npart of that strategy.So, as used in line three,\nvent most nearly means,and so this is a more\nstraightforward questionbut it is just, essentially,\nwe could rephrase itto what does vent meanand now, if I had the passage,I would go back to the passage,read a little bit around the word vent,gather some context clues,\nand then say my predictionfor the second part of the strategywas that vent meant gap, and\nso I'd write down my predictionor just say it in my head,\nand then, and only then,so you can lift up your hand now,would I look at the answer choices,and at that point, with gap in mind,it's a bit easier to eliminate\nsome of the answer choicesthat don't match, and narrow\nit down to the ones that do.So, for example, gap\ndoesn't fit passage as well,doesn't fit outlet as\nwell, and then I'm downto opening and crack, and in the real SATI would go into the reading passage,gather some context clues and\nsee what I'm finding there.So, that's an example of howthis Rephrase and Predict strategy looksfor a standalone sample problemand later in class we're\ngonna apply this strategyin a real SAT reading\npassage with a few questionsjust so you get used to it.But before we do that, I want\nto cover Words in Contextand Command of Evidence problems,which are two common problemsthat you'll see in the SAT Reading.So Words in Context questions,\nwhat are these exactly?So these problems measure\nyour understandingof the meaning and use\nof words and phrasesin the context of passages\nand this word, context,is the most important part.And so these questions don't\nask you to define words,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.106}, {"text": "you might know the meaning\nof words in day to day lifelike determination, but what\nmakes these questions uniqueis that the context of\nthe passage is crucialand so you wanna look a little bit beforeand after and around the word,so that you can gather\nthe surrounding words,ideas and circumstances to pick upon how the author is using the wordin the passage and what it means.And so there are two specific typesof Words in Context\nquestions and the first one,is interpreting words\nand phrases in context.So these questions ask you\nwhat word or phrase meansas used in the passage,\nand so that's very muchlike the sample problem we\ndid around the word ventas used in line three, most nearly meansand so you're probably\nfamiliar with these.The next type asks youhow the author's choice of\nwords affects the passageand affects the meaning, tone and style.So if this first question type\nis more of a what question,this second question type is\nmore of a purpose or impact,is one helpful way of thinking about it.So we'll take a look at these\nWords in Context problemslater in class but this should\ngive you a good overviewof the types of Words in Context questionsyou might see on the SAT\non the Reading sectionand also in the Writing Section,so let's keep going now\nto Command of Evidence.So Command of Evidence\nquestions are designedto see whether you\nunderstand how an authoruses evidence to support a claimor argument or point that they're makingand this is a skill\nthat's tested on the SATbecause it's really crucial in college,in the workforce, you\nknow, once you graduate,or in day to day life and so it really isvery applicable to creating arguments,defending arguments, evaluating them", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and on the SAT, how will they show up?Well, there are three\ntypes of evidence questionsthat you'll see, and so\nthe first one asks youto determine the best type of evidence,so it'll ask you what textual evidenceprovides the best support or,the other type of question\nhere, will show up in pairswhere it'll ask you what is\nthe main point of paragraph oneand then the second question will ask youwhat evidence best supportsyour answer to the first question.Now, the second type of question\nunder the evidence sectionwill ask you to interpret datain graphics of different kindsand it'll ask you to look at the graphic,understand it and how it\nrelates to the passageand any claims the author may be making.Now, a tip I would have here,would be to break down\nthe graph piece by piece,so rather than trying to\nunderstand it all at once,ask yourself just one\nsimple question at a time,so that you build up your\nunderstanding from the ground upand so you could ask what is the title,and what is it telling me?You could ask about the axes next,and so the axes and units,you might look at the key,and all of these questions will\nhelp you build to the pointwhere you can state, in your own words,this graph is showing me the distributionof fir trees around California.Now, the third and final\ntype of evidence questionasks you how an argument usesor doesn't use specific\npieces of evidence,so those are things like\nfacts, figures, quotations,and how that influences\nthe author's claimsor arguments that they're making.So, there were was a lot of\ninformation to take in up front,but let's now apply what\nwe've discussed so faron the Rephrase & Predict strategy,Words in Context questionsand the Command of Evidence questions,within a real SAT passage.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So let's get some practice togetherbefore you head off to Khan\nAcademy to practice yourself.Oop, let me zoom out a little bit here.So, before I start,before we start going\nthrough this passage,I just wanna share that how we\ngo through the passage todaymight be a little bit differentfrom how you would do this if\nyou were by yourself at homeand it's just because I'm on a computerand so it's harder,\nit's just a little hardfor me to show you all\nof the passage at onceand so, just for today,\nas we walk through it,we'll go through this a\nfew paragraphs at a timeand bounce back and forth\nbetween the questionsbut how you would do this at home,might look a little bit different, okay?So let's take a look, let's\ngo ahead and read the passagejust up to this point\nhere and then we'll pause.So let's go ahead and do that.This passage is excerpted\nfrom Kasley Killam,A Hug A Day Keeps the Doctor Away, okay.Scientific American, okay,\nso looks like a study.So, during my final semester\nof undergrad, I made two signsthat read, feeling stressed\nabout exams, have a free hug!Then I recruited a friend and we stoodin the entrance of the campus library,held up the signs, and waited.Passersby had one of two reactions,either they quickly looked\ndown at their phonesand awkwardly shuffled by,or their faces lit up as they embraced us.Most people were enthusiastic.Some exclaimed, \"You made my day!\"Or \"thank you, I needed this.\"One leapt into my arms,\nnearly toppling me over.After two hours of warm interactions,my friend and I couldn't believehow energized and happy we felt.Okay, so let me go through that againand just mark up a few important things,so, feeling stressed about\nexams, have a free hug,and they had warm interactionsand then, at the end,they were feeling pretty\nenergized and happy,so then this seems like\njust a story about how,", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.169}, {"text": "at the end of this person's\nundergrad career, okay.So let's read the next paragraph now.A study published earlier this monthsuggests that, in addition to making usfeel connected to others,all those hugs may have\nprevented us from getting sick,okay, so that seems importantand this is the topic\nsentence of the paragraphso worth paying a little\nmore attention to.At first, this finding probably\nseems counterintuitive,not to mention bizarre.You might think, like I did,that hugging hundreds of strangers,hugging strangers would\nincrease your exposure to germsand therefore the likelihood\nof falling ill, okay.But, we've got a but here,\nso but words, contrast wordsare very important, and often\nsignal a shift in the passageso, but, the new research\nout of Carnegie Mellonindicates that feeling connectedespecially through physical touch,protects us from stress-induced sickness.Okay, so this research adds\nto a large amount of evidencefor the positive influence\nof social support on health.Okay, so just to confirm that\nI understand this passage,we've got a topic sentence\nthat said feeling connectedto others seems to have\nthese health benefitsand hugging a lot of people,rather than exposing\nyou to germs, actually,according to the Carnegie\nMellon study offerssome protection against\nstress-induced sickness, okay.Okay, so I think I understand that,and what you'll notice, as\nI was reading the passage,was that I was pretty actively writingand underlining and making\nsure that I understoodwhat I was reading as I wentand so there's an active reading articlethat we have on Khan Academythat would be great to check outbut that's how you can readand make sure you\nunderstand along the way,to save yourself time,\nso you aren't re-readingas much as you go along.So, we have the passage,now let's look at the first question.So here we're gonna use the\nRephrase & Predict strategy", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.228}, {"text": "that we mentioned, so again,take your left hand or your right hand,whichever non-dominant hand you have,and go ahead and cover up A through Dand now we're gonna look at the questions.So the first paragraph serves mainly to,so we're just looking up until this part,everything above this part,\nand if I rephrase this,this is just what is the\npurpose of the first paragraph.Okay, so I don't need to write that downsince it'll take me some time.So what is the purpose\nof the first paragraph?Well, let's take a look\nat the first paragraphand probably a little bit of\ncontext from the second as welland that will inform my predictionfor what I think the answer is.So, when I was reading\nthis passage earlier,this seemed like the author's storyabout something he did in\nundergrad, about making signsand mentioned how positive\nthis hugging experience wasand then, in the next paragraph,we've got the study and the impact of hugsand we get a little more scientific hereand so the first paragraph\nserves mainly to,or the purpose of the first paragraph,my prediction here is going to bethat it was a story and then if we lookat the structure here,\nwe have the story hereand then we have the study here,so that's kind of how\nI'm thinking about it,story that leads into the studyand so that's my prediction\nand, as you can see,it doesn't have to be super\nsophisticated and complex,in fact, if you have a good\nunderstanding of the passagethe prediction is often pretty simpleand a few words is all that you need.And so now, I can uncover the\nanswer choices A through Dand take a look at which\none matches my predictionof the author used the\nfirst paragraph as a story,as a way of introducing and\ngiving background for the study.So, let's take a look at the first one,provide background information necessary", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.323}, {"text": "to understand the scientific study,so that is not completely\noff from what I mentionedbut not exactly what I said\neither, so I'll leave that inand then introduce the scientific studythrough a personal anecdote.Okay, so that's actually\nvery close to my predictionsince an anecdote is a storyand I mentioned this introduce pieceso that seems like the\ntop candidate so far.But let's take a look at these other ones,so show that not all\nscientific experimentsneed to be conducted in a laboratory.Well, we're not talking, in the passage,about all scientific experimentsand there's no mention of\na laboratory in the passageso I can go ahead and cross that one out.And then last one, describe\nthe author's experienceas the subject of the scientific study.So, the first paragraph is more of a storyand the author actually doesn't mentionthat it was a scientific study,it was just more of\nsomething that they didin the last semester,\nso this scientific studywill eliminate this, and so\nB is really the best choicethat matches my\nprediction, which was basedon the information that\nI had in the passage.So that's an example of\nhow Rephrase & Predictis used in practice, it can\ntake some getting used tobut once you practice a little bit more,you'll get faster and faster at thatand once you have the prediction,going through the answer\nchoices will be a lot faster.Now, the other thing I'll point outis that as I was going\nthrough the answer choices,you might have seen me cross offcertain parts of answer choices,and that was because the right answerwill be completely right\nand supported by the passageand if there is a part of an answer choicethat feels off or isn't\nsupported by the passage,that's enough for me to cross it offand so that just helps me eliminateanswer choices a little bit fasterand is another thing you can try.So let's take a look at\nsome of the other questions", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.452}, {"text": "and keep on going.So let's take a look,\nin the second paragraphthe author implies that\nthe study shows hugs to be,so now we're talking about this paragraph,second paragraph, here.Author implies that the\nstudy shows hugs to be,so this is, I can rephrase this to bestudy shows hugs to be,hugs to be question mark.Okay, and again, I'm not looking\nat the answer choices yetsince that will automatically\ninfluence my thinkingand I'll start thinking well\nmaybe it's A, maybe it's D,but before I have formed my own opinion,I don't wanna do thatso let's take a look back\nat the second paragraphand look for the studyand what the author is\nimplying about that.So, study published\nearlier suggests that hugsmake us feel connected and\nprevent us from getting sick,and prevent us from getting sickand then here's the study, here,so new research out of Carnegie Mellon,shows that feeling connected,especially through physical touch,protects us from stress-induced sickness.So that is pretty positive, so hugs good,is kind of the takeaway thereand so then my prediction\nfor what the author is sayingimplies that the study shows about hugs,is that hugs are good for health,good for health and have\nthese health benefitsor have these protection,\nwill help protect usfrom sickness, or protect from sickness.And now, with that predictionI can go ahead and\nuncover the answer choices", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.5}, {"text": "and look through A through\nD, so let's take a look.A says that hugs are\nthe only proven methodof preventing sickness,\nso only proven method,makes that not correct, cos the study saysthat there's some benefits of hugsbut certainly doesn't claimthat it's the only proven method,and doesn't match my prediction\neither, so let's keep going.Less successful than social supportat protecting people from\ncolds and other illnesses.So in this case, they're makingan interesting comparison hereabout less successful than social supportand that's really not\nsomething that's mentionedin the second paragraph, and again,doesn't match my prediction\nbased on the paragraph,so this less successful\nthan social support,there's no comparison that's\nbeing made in that paragraph,so we can go ahead and cross that out.And then we have not\nconclusively effectiveat helping people maintain good health.So this actually, the tone of thisis hugs are so-so, we're\nnot sure about hugs,but this was, we have hugs good here,we know hugs are good, even\nif we didn't read the passageso that not conclusively effectiveis the opposite of what the\nauthor's actually implyingand so D then, one of several waysto guard against some illnesses.Well, here's that part of my prediction,so protect from illness, good for health,and so therefore, my answer is D.So, this was now an example of\na Command of Evidence problemand how the Rephrase & Predict strategycan be used in that context.But, this is a two-parter,\nso we're not done yet.Let's head back in and\npinpoint the evidencethat matches and supports our answer.So, which choice provides\nthe best evidencefor the answer to the previous question?", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.472}, {"text": "So, in this case, let's take a look,we've got, again, so we're lookingfor the best evidence here,and let's go back and\nlook at the passage here,and again, we're not looking\nat the answer choicesand so, why did I choose D,is essentially what the passage is sayingand what evidence from\nthe passage supports thatand so, this is about\nthe study showing hugsand so, you can hone in here\non this hugs good sectionand the study is mentioned here,about Carnegie Mellon,the Carnegie Mellon study about\nphysical touch protecting usfrom stress-induced illness,\nso that's a great thing,and so I think that's really where,where I made my decision thereand so then I can uncover\nthe answer choicesand, looks like answer\nchoice C is that answer.And so, just for completion's sake,I'll make sure to look throughsome of these other ones\njust to walk through,but that matches exactly\nwhat I was thinkingand my prediction about\nthe Carnegie Mellon study.So, line 12 through 14, a study, sickness,so a study published earliersuggests that in addition\nto making us feel connectedall these hugs may have\nprevented us from getting sick,so that one feels more like commentaryand oh, actually forgot\nI posted this down hereso we can look down here too,so that one is more of\ncommentary, so that one's outand then 16 to 18, you\nmight think like I didthat hugging hundreds of strangerswould increase your exposure,\nthat again is more commentaryand isn't providing evidence and then Dis 21 to 23, this research addsto a large amount of evidence here,and again, that is not as strongas the evidence presented herethat we're citing from Carnegie Mellonso that one is out as well.Okay, so now we've done\nsome Command of Evidence,now let's take a look at a\nWords in Context questionand that'll be the last\npractice problem we do together", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.395}, {"text": "before we move on to a few other things.Let's take a look at\nthe next paragraph here,so it looks like we're looking here now,from here to here, so social\nsupport can broadly be definedas the perception of\nmeaningful relationshipsthat serve as a psychological\nresource during tough times.More specifically, this\nmeans emotional support,such as expressions of compassion,and may include access to\ninformation or other assistance.The researchers measured social supportby giving out a questionnairein which participants\nrated different statements.Then, they conducted interviews\nevery night for two weeksto find out how often\nparticipants experienced conflictwith others and how\noften they received hugs.Finally, the researchers\ninfected participantswith a common cold virus\nand observed what happened.So that part seems questionable,I don't know about the ethics\nof doing that last partbut this paragraph then\nis saying social support,what that means, and it looks\nlike it's emotional supportand expressions of compassion,\ninformation and assistanceand then this was how they conductedthe rest of the experiment.Okay, so then in line 27,\nexpressions most nearly means,so what does expressions mean,\nand so, more specifically,this means emotional\nsupport such as expressionsof compassion and may\ninclude access to informationor other assistance, okay.So I've taken into\nconsideration the contextand it seems like in this context,it's expressions of compassion,could also be stated as acts\nof compassion or kindnessand so these are kind of\nmore physical behaviorsis gonna be my prediction\nso then let's take a lookat what matches my prediction.So, demonstrations, yep, that could be,demonstrations are an acts of\nkindness, seems pretty close.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.458}, {"text": "Declarations of compassion,\nthat's more wordsbut I've got acts here,so I don't think that one fits as well.We've got revelations, so that's more,that means something like discoveriesand we're not discovering\nkindness here so that's outand then looks of compassion,\nalso doesn't quite fitsince I am all about acts of compassionand so demonstrations of compassionreally is what fits best.So this was the last practice\nproblem that we'll do togetherand if you wanna re-watch any\nof what we've gone through,we'll send out the recording againbut now, it's time to do some,I'm gonna answer a few student questionsand so, if you have any questions,go ahead and put them into\nthe YouTube comments nowand then I'll answer as many as I canbefore we head over to Khan Academyto practice what we've learned.So, take a minute to do\nthat as I get set up here.Okay, so we've got a few questionsfrom students here so let me take a look.First question, are there deducted pointsfor incorrect answers on the SAT?So, answer to that is no,so there is no guessing penalty on the SATon any of the sections and so that meansif you're not sure of the right answerfor a question, you should always guessand so that goes for multiple choice,for free response in the Math section,and so you should always guesssince there is no guessing penalty.Let's see, another question we gotis are the SAT practice tests\non par with the real tests?Like if I score a 1300\non the practice test,would I expect to score that on the SAT?Well, assuming you're talking\nabout the practice testson official SAT practice, on Khan Academy,those practice tests\nare official SAT testsreleased by College Board and\nare an accurate reflection", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.421}, {"text": "of what you can expect on the real SAT.So if you find yourself\nconsistently scoring,say, in the 1250 to 1300 range,that is a pretty good\nindication of what you'll getand what you might find\non the real test daybut the only thing I would say is there,on the real test day, there\nmight be a few factorsthat aren't at play during practice testslike nerves, or how well you slept,or what you ate that day, so\nit is a pretty good indicationbut it might not be exactly perfect.We got a question about general adviceon how to manage time, well,the resource I'd direct you to thereis there are a handful of\narticles on the Khan Academyin our tips and strategies section,that have tips for how\nyou can manage your timeon Math, Reading and Writingand so I'd really give that\na thorough read throughand it really has everythingthat I would tell you to do anywayand I think we'll try and post that linkin the comments as wellbut there are things like working throughsome of the simpler problems first,since all SAT questions are\nworth the same number of points,going through the easier\nand medium questionsso that you have ample time for thosebefore you go to the harder questions,is one way you can do it but\nreally check out those articlesfor the best advice that we have on that.We had a question, if your predictiondoesn't match the answers, does\nthat mean you read it wrong?So that's a great question,\nso say you had a predictionthat the word vent meant gapand then it didn't match\nanything in the answer choices,what I would encourage you to do then,is yes, to go back into the passageand make sure you've consideredall of the context around the passageand make sure you understand\nthat paragraph well enoughthat you can restate\nwhat the author is sayingand what the purpose of that\nparagraph is in your own words", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.676}, {"text": "and if you can state it in your own words,that is really a good checkto see if you understood\nthe author's pointand the argument or statement\nthat they were makingand so if your prediction doesn't match,in that case yeah, I would\ngo back to the passageand make sure you understood\nwhat the author was sayingand then give that prediction another go.Another way you could\napproach it is to just lookat what the passage says\nand the evidence there.So the right answer in\nSAT Reading questionswill have textual evidence to support itand so you can work backwards a little bitto look at the passage and\nsee, okay, what evidencedo I have to support one\nof these answer choices?Another question, should\nI read the passage firstor read the questions first?So that one, there are a lot\nof different opinions on thisand I would say, it really comes downto how you've practiced and\nwhat you've found works well.So some people will read\nthrough and scan the questionsjust so that they can\nmark out in the passageokay, I've got a question at line seven,a question at line 53, and then I needto notice a shift in tone somewhereand so that, for some\nstudents, they like to lookat what they're gonna be\nasked so that they knowwhere to pay more attention\nto in the passage.Other students, they wanna just focus,for other students a different approachof reading the whole\npassage, really understandingand understanding each paragraphand the author's argument and claimsand then looking at the\nquestions is easier,so that they're just\nfocusing on understandingand then going into the questions.So I would really say practice, try both,see which one works best\nfor you and go with that.I just wouldn't, if you're\nclose to your test date,don't change things up at the last minute.Okay, so we have another good question,if you're forced to skip\na question or guess,and have enough time to go\nback, should you go back to itat the end of the passage problem setor at the end of the reading portion?", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.446}, {"text": "So I would definitely sayat the end of the passage problem set,so say you have questions one through 11on a reading passage\nand you skip number ninecos you're like oh, I don't know,it could be either of these,\nonce you get to question 11,and you've finished all the\nquestions on that passage,revisit question nine at that pointbecause it'll be easier for your brainto stay within the mode of that passagewhereas if you wait til\nthe end of the passage,you then have to remind yourself, okay,what was this passage about?And what was question nine asking?So it'll just take you longer to do that.So, we're coming up a\nlittle bit on time nowand so, unfortunately all the\nquestions I can cover for nowbut I'll cover more questions next timeand for now, I wanna\nshow you a few pointersabout practicing for\nthe SAT on Khan Academy,the badge, one-on-one chat,\nand all of that good stuff,so let's take a look.So, like I mentioned at the beginning,we have people waiting to help youif you run into any questions\nand chat with you one-on-onebut a common question we\nget, is what if I don't seethe one-on-one chat box on Khan Academy?Well, one thing I want to point outis that the one-on-one\nchat is only availableon the SAT part, so make\nsure your web addresslooks something like\nKhanAcademy.org/mission/SATand if you're not on a\nURL that looks like thatthen that's why the one-on-one\nchat is not showing up.The other thing you can tryis to try and refresh the page as well.Now, when you head over to Khan Academy,the first thing I'd recommend you dois to explore a bit and then\ndo some practice problems.So while we have those wonderful folkswho are volunteering their time to help,the best thing you can do is startby doing some practice problems yourselfand then if you get stuck, reach out.In just a bit we're also\ngoing to share the badge link", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.367}, {"text": "and so that'll show up in the commentsand for that you will sign\ninto your Khan Academy accountand then your badge will show\nup in the top right corner,oh, this is no longer right,but there will be a notification\nicon that you'll see thereand so we'll post the badge thereand so now, if you're familiar\nwith official SAT practiceon Khan Academy, go ahead\nand head over there nowand sign into your Khan Academy account,start practicing, and if you get stuck,reach out to one of our amazing peoplewho are here to help you today.If you're brand new to\nofficial SAT practice,I'm gonna do a quick walkthroughof some of the key parts\njust to get you started.So, this is official SAT\npractice on Khan Academyand so you'll see this is the homepage,and if I wanted to practice,\nI'd just head over hereand click practice and\nyou'll see that I have Math,Reading & Writing and\nEssay portions as welland for today, you'll\nsee that you can practiceany reading topic here, or if you wantedto go to Writing & Language,you can practice anything here as well.Now, if you want a refresheron a topic that you don't see here,I'd really recommend you go\nup here to the search barand type up a search, for say\nquadratic equations, right?So that's one thing you can doand then if you have general\nquestions about the SAT,the format, strategies you can use,so time management, for example,these are two great articles\nthat I mentioned before,I would head here to go throughand get answers to those questions.Let's take a look,and I think that's most of\nwhat I was going to cover,so go ahead and head over, and then,oh, the last thing I'll call out,is this is where you'll see that chat boxand so you can just type in here,ask a question, and we'll\nget back to you as soon as,reply as quickly as we can.So, that's all I have\nfor you today on
