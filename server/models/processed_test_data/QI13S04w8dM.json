going to be review on\nthe setting of our notationand conventions clear.So, our first topic is\nthe Schrodinger equation.So this Schrodinger\nequation is an equationthat takes the following form.I h bar partial\nderivative of this objectcalled the wave function\nthat depends on x and tis equal to minus h squared\nover 2m second derivativewith respect to x plus v\nof x and t Psi of x and t.And that's the full equation.That's the Schrodinger equation.Now actually, this is not\nthe Schrodinger equationin most generality, but it's\nthe Schrodinger equationfor the case that you\nhave a potential thatdepends on x and t.For the case that we are doing\nnon-relativistic physics,because this thing you may\nremember is p squared over 2mis the kinetic energy operator.So p squared over 2m\nis non-relativistic.That's a non-relativistic\nkinetic energy.So this is non-relativistic.Moreover, we have\njust one x here.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "That means it's a\nparticle in one dimension.So we've done a few things,\nbut this is generally enoughto illustrate our ideas.And the most\nimportant thing thatshould be said at\nthis point is that Psiof x and t-- which is\nthe wave function--belongs to the complex numbers.It's a complex number.And that's by necessity.If Psi would be real, this\nquantity-- the right handside-- would be real.The potential is a real number.On the left hand side, on the\nother hand, if Psi is real,its derivative would be real,\nand this would be imaginary.So, it's just impossible to get\nthe solution of this equationif Psi is real.So, Psi complex is really\nthe fundamental thingthat can be said about\nthis wave function.Now, you've used complex\nnumbers in physics all the time,and even in electromagnetism,\nyou use complex numbers.But you use them really\nin an auxiliary way only.You didn't use them in an\nabsolutely necessary way.So, for example.In E&M, you had an electric\nfield, for example,for a circularly polarized wave.And you would write it as this.Let me put the z here.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.161}, {"text": "Zero.X hat plus y hat--\nthose are unit vectors.I is a complex number.It's the square root of minus 1.E to the IKZ minus omega t.You typically wrote\nthings like that,but, in fact, you\nalways meant real part.An electric field\nis a real quantity.And the Maxwell's equations\nare real equations.This is a circularly\npolarized wave.And this whole\nthing-- by the timeyou take the real part of\nthis, all these complex numbersplay absolutely no role.It's just a neat way of writing\na complicated electric fieldin which the x component and the\ny component are out of phase,and that you have a wave at\nthe same time propagatingin the z direction.So this-- in the\nhere, E is real,and all i's are auxiliary.This is completely\ndifferent from the caseof the Schrodinger equation.This i there is fundamental.The Psi is the\ndynamical variable,and it has to be complex.So, we make a few remarks\nabout the Schrodinger equationto get started.First remark is that this\nis first order differentialequation in time.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.166}, {"text": "This has implications.Those two derivatives\nare maybe--for some funny\nHamiltonians, you canhave even more than two\nderivatives or more complicatedthings.But definitely there's just\none derivative in time.So, what this means\nis that if youknow the wave function\nall over space,you can calculate\nwhat it's goingto be a little time later.Because if you know\nit all over space,you can calculate\nthis right hand sideand know what is\nthe time derivative.And with the time\nderivative, youcan figure it out what\nit's going to be later.A first order differential\nequation in timeis something that if you know\nthe quantity at one time,the differential\nequation tells youwhat it's going to be later.So, that's really sufficient.Psi of x-- of all x's-- at some\ntime t naught determines Psiat all times.Second property,\nfundamental property.The equation is linear.So, if you have\ntwo solutions, youcan form a third by\nsuperimposing them,and you can superimpose them\nwith complex coefficients.So, if you have two\nsolutions, Psi 1 and Psi 2,then a 1 Psi 1 plus A2\nPsi 2 is a solution.And here the a's belong\nto the complex numbers.So A 1 and A 2 are\ncomplex numbers.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.25}, {"text": "As far as complex\nnumbers are concerned,the first thing you\njust need to knowis the definition of the\nlength of a complex number.So, if you have z, a\ntypical name peopleuse for a complex number,\nhaving two components.A plus ib, where\na and b are real.There's the definition of\nthe complex conjugate, whichis a minus ib, and\nthere's the definitionof the length of the\ncomplex number, whichis square root of a\nsquared plus b squared,which is the square\nroot of z times z star.So, that's for your\ncomplex number.So, the property that this makes\nthis into a physical theoryand goes beyond math\nis what you knowis the interpretation of the\nwave function as a probability.So, what do we construct?We construct p of x and\nt, or sometimes calledthe row of x and t as a density.And it's defined\nas Psi star of x t.Now, here the notation\nmeans this Psi star--we'd put the star\nhere-- it reallymeans Psi of x and\nt complex conjugate.You complex conjugate\nthe wave function.And you get that.We'd put the star here,\nand typically don'tput the parentheses, unless\nyou have to complex conjugatesomething that's a\nlittle ambiguous.So, Psi star of

multiply by little dx,\nthis is the probabilityto find the particle in the\ninterval x comma x plus dxat time t.So, this is our\nprobability density.It's a way to make physics\nout of the wave function.It's a postulate.And so the consequence\nof this postulate,since we're describing\njust one particle,is that we must have the\nparticle as somewhere.So, if we add the probabilities\nthat the particle is somewhereall over space, this\nis the probabilitythat the particle is in\nthis little dx we integratedthat must be equal to 1.And this must hold\nfor all times.In terms of things\nto notice here,maybe one thing you can\nnotice is the units of Psi.The units of Psi must be 1\nover square root of length,because when we square it,\nthen we multiply it by length,we get one, which has no units.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.131}, {"text": "Key property of the\nSchrodinger equation.We will revisit the Schrodinger\nequation later and derive it,sort of the way [?

quantum mechanics.And it will be\ntrue, that feeling.But here, we're going to\ngo the other way around.Just simply ask the\nquestion-- supposeyou have a wave function\nsuch that the integralof this quantity at some\nspecific time is equal to one.Will this integral be\nequal to one for all times,given that it is one\nat some given time?Now, you say, well,\nwhy do you ask that?I ask that because actually\nthis could be a problem.We've said that if you know the\nwave function all over spaceat one time, it's\ndetermined everywhere.So any time later.Therefore, if I know the wave\nfunction at time equal zerois good-- time equal t zero--\nis a good wave function,I might warranty that when I\nsaw the Schrodinger equation,the wave function will be\nnormalized, well, later?Yes, you are.And it's a simple or\ninteresting exercisethat we'll call it\nthe quick calculationthat I'll leave\nit for you to do.Which is show that d dt of\nthis integral Psi of x and t", "start": 720.0, "heat":

it could be a\nfunction of time,because you put an\narbitrary time here.The integral might\ndepend on time.So, it's a good question to\nthink of that integral thatmay be a function of time\nand take its derivative.If its derivative is\nzero for all times,and that sometimes equal to\none, it will be one forever.So, you must show\nthat this is true.Now, this I think you've done\none way or another several waysmaybe in 804.But I ask you to do it again.So this is left for you as a\nway to warm up on this object.And you will see actually\nthat it's a little subtle.It's a little delicate,\nbecause how is it going to go?You're going to go in and take\nthe derivative of Psi Psi star.You're going to take\nthe derivative of Psiand you're going to use\nthe Schrodinger equation.You're going to take the\nderivative of Psi star,and you're going to use\nthe complex conjugateof the Schrodinger equation.It's going to be a little messy.But then you're going to\ndo integration by parts,and you're going to get zero,\nbut only if you throw awaythe terms at infinity.And what gives you the\nright to throw them away?You will have to think.And the answer is that\nyou will throw them awayif the wave function\ngoes to zeroat infinity, which must do it.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.22}, {"text": "The wave function must\ngo to zero at infinity,because if it didn't\ngo to zero at infinity,it went to a\nconstant at infinity,it would pick up an\nun-normalizable thing here.So the wave function definitely\nhas to go to zero at infinity.But that will also\nnot be quite enoughif you're careful about\nwhat you're doing.You will have to demand that the\nderivative of the wave functiondoesn't blow up.It's not asking too much,\nbut it's asking something.A function could go\nto zero, presumably,and its derivative at\nthe same time blow up,but it would be a very\npathological function.This will bring us to\nsomething that we said.We're going to\ntry to be precise,but it's not so\neasy to be precise.When you try to be\nprecise, you canexaggerate and go\nprecise to a pointthat you're paralyzed with\nfear with every equation.We don't want to get that far.We want you to notice what\nhappens and just look at itand state what you need.Why can't we be precise?Because at the end of\nthe day, this equationis extraordinarily\ncomplicated, and maybe crazy.The potential is crazy enough.So, functions-- mathematicians\ncan invent crazy functions,things like a function that is\none for every rational numberand zero for every\nrational number.Put that for a potential here,\nand who knows what one gets.So, we're going to\ntake mild functions.We're not going to make\nthem a very complicated,and we're going to be stating\nvery soon what we need.So, what you need\nfor this to workis that the function\ngoes to zeroand the relative goes to zero.Yes.AUDIENCE: The potential\nhas to be real always?PROFESSOR: The potential\nis real at this moment.Yes.For the discussion\nthat we're doing here,", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.383}, {"text": "v is also a real number.AUDIENCE: So it\ncan't be complex?PROFESSOR: Sorry?AUDIENCE: Can it be complex?PROFESSOR: It could be\nin certain

consider\ntime-independent thingsto review the things that are a\nlittle more basic and importantand that you should\ndefinitely remember well.OK, so that's this part of\nthe Schrodinger equation.I want to remind you of\nanother concept calledthe current--\nprobability current.Probability current.What is it?It's a j of x and\nt-- that you willreview in the homework--\nis given by h over m,the imaginary part of\nPsi star d Psi over dx.So, it's a real quantity.And it's called a\nprobability current.And it goes together with\nthis probability density,this probability density\nthat we wrote over here.So it's the current\nassociated to that density.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.431}, {"text": "Let's think a second\nwhat this means.In electromagnetism, you have\ncurrents and charged

have\nelectromagnetism,the most famous thing associated\nto electromagnetism currentsand charged densities is the\nso-called conservation law.This differential\nequations satisfiedby the current and the density.Divergence of j plus d\nRho dt is equal to zero.That means charge conservation.You may or may\nnot remember that.If you don't, it's a good\ntime to review it in E&Mand check on that,\ndiscuss it in recitation.Think about it.This means charge conservation\nas we usually understand,and the way to do it--\nI'm saying just in words--is you think of\na volume, you cansee how much charge\nis inside, and yousee that the rate of\nchange of the chargeis proportional to the current\nthat is escaping the volume.Which is to say, charge is\nnever destroyed or created.It can escape a volume,\nbecause the charges are moving,but if it doesn't escape, well,\nthe charge remains the same.So, this is charge conservation.And this is the same thing.So the divergence\nof j in this casereduces to dj dx plus\nd Rho dt equals zero.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.461}, {"text": "It has a very similar\ninterpretation.So, perhaps in\nequations, it's easierto think of interpretation.Consider the real line\nand the point a and b,with a less than b.And define the\nprobability pab of tof finding the particle in\nthis interval between a and bat any time.You should be able to\nshow-- and it's againanother thing to review.This you can review.And this review as well.You will use this differential\nequation, things like that,to show that dpab dt-- the\nrate at which the probabilitythat you find the particle\nin this interval changesdepends on what the\ncurrent is doing hereand what the current\nis doing here.So, it's actually given by j of\na and t minus j at b at time t.You can show, and\nplease try to show it.So, what does that mean?You can have the particle\nhere at any time.But if you want to know how\nthe probability changing,you must see how\nit's leaking from aor how it's leaking from b.Now j's are defined,\nby convention,positive to the right.So, if there's a current--\na bit of current at a,it increases the probability.", "start": 1320.0,

that these wave functions\nare-- you want them normalized,but we can work with\nthem and they'rephysically equivalent if they\ndiffer just by a constant.So Psi 1 and Psi 2 are\nsaid to be equivalentif

these are\nnormalized functions,they could differ by a phase.And they would still be\nphysically equivalent.This part of the definition\nof the theory-- the definitionof the theory is that these\nwave functions are reallyphysically equivalent\nand indistinguishable.And that puts a constraint on\nthe way we define observables.Any observable should\nhave this propertythat, whether we used this\nwave function or the other,they give you the\nsame observables.So, if your wave\nfunctions are normalized,this can be complex\nconstant of length one.Then one normalized implies\nthe other is normalized.If

we should keep.So, now we've reviewed\nthe Schrodinger equation.Next thing we want to say is\nthe most important solutionsof the Schrodinger equations\nare those energy Eigenstates,stationary states.And let's just go\nthrough that subjectand explain what it was.So, I'm going to\nstart erasing here.So we're going to look at--\nwhoops-- stationary solutions.Now, I've used this\nweek wave functionwith a capital\nPsi for a purpose,because I want to distinguish\nit from another Psithat we're going to\nencounter very soon.So, stationary solutions.And we'll take it-- from now\nassume v is time-independent.The case is\nsufficiently importantthat we may as well do it.So, in this case, the\nSchrodinger equationis written as I h bar\nd Psi dt, and we'llwrite it with something\ncalled an h hat acting on Psi.And h hat at this\npoint is nothing elsethan minus h squared over 2m\nsecond derivative with respectto x plus v of x.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.25}, {"text": "We say that h hat is an operator\nacting on the wave functionPsi on the right.Operator acting on that--\nwhat does that mean?Basically, when we say an\noperator acts on some space,we mean that it takes\nelements of that

derivatives,multiplying by v\nof x, and you stillgot some complex\nfunction of x and t.So, this is called the\nHamiltonian operator,and it's written like that.This Hamiltonian operator\nis time-independent.So, what is a stationary state?A stationary state-- the way\nit's defined is as follows.A stationary state of energy\ne-- which is a real number--is a Psi of x and t\nof the following form.It's a simple form.It's a pure exponential in\ntime times a function thatjust depends on x.So, it's a pretty simple object.So what is it?We say that this is\na stationary state.e to the minus i

time-independent one.So this also belongs\nto the complex numbers,but doesn't depend on time.So, it's called stationary\nbecause, as it turns out,when we will compute expectation\nvalues of any observableon this state, in\nthis stationary state,it will be time-independent.In particular, you\nknow, one thingthat observable is the\nprobability density.And when you look at that,\nyou have Psi star and Psi.Since E is real,\nthis phase cancels--this is really a face,\nbecause E is real.Therefore, Psi star Psi, the\ne cancels, and all the timedependence cancels\nand goes away.Same thing here for the j.The x derivative over here\nit doesn't do anythingto that phase.Therefore, the phase e\nto the i Et over H barcancels from there two.And the current also\nhas no time dependence.So, this will be the case\nfor any operator thatis called a\ntime-independent operator.It will have time-independent\nexpectation values.So you can ask anything about\nsome familiar operator-- energyoperator, momentum operator,\nangular momentum operator-- allthe famous operators\nof quantum mechanics,and it will have real\nexpectation values.So, as you, you're\nsupposed to now plug this", "start": 1800.0,

put the exponentialin front-- H on little Psi.So, we multiply here,\nand what do we get?Well, the H bars cancel.The i at minus i gives you one.You get that E in front.So you get E times\nthis phase

yes,\nthere's no problemwith this Psi being real.The total Psi just can't\nbe real in general.But this one can be\na real, and we'llconsider those cases as well.So, things that\nwe want to say isthat

wellsay that this is minus\nh squared over 2m.The second Psi vx squared\nplus v of x tines Psi of x.Because Psi only depends\non x, might as wellwrite it as complete derivative.So, second
