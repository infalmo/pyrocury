[{"text": "On the evening of August 5, 2012 Pacific Daylight\nTime, NASA's Mars Rover, named Curiosity,entered Mars' atmosphere at 20,000km/h. Drag\nslowed it down to around 1600km/hr, at whichpoint a parachute opened. This parachute slowed\nthe Rover more, to about 320km/hr, or 90 m/s.Finally, after rockets decelerated it completely,\nthe rover was lowered to the surface of Mars.Every step of this dance was carefully choreographed\nand rehearsed in many experiments here onEarth. But how could NASA engineers be sure\nthat their designs would work on a totallydifferent planet? The answer is a problem-solving\nmethod called dimensional analysis.This video is part of the Problem Solving\nvideo series.Problem-solving skills, in combination with\nan understanding of the natural and human-madeworld, are critical to the design and optimization\nof systems and processes.Hi, my name is Ken Kamrin, and I am a professor\nof mechanical engineering at MIT. Dimensionalanalysis is a powerful tool; I use it, NASA\nuses it, and you will too.Before watching this video, you should be\nfamiliar with unit analysis, and understandthe difference between dependent and independent\nvariables.By the end of this video, you will be able\nto use dimensional analysis to estimate thesize of a parachute canopy that can slow the\nRover down to 90 m/s on its descent to Mars.Before we talk about dimensional analysis,\nwe need to know what dimension is. Dimensionsand units are related, but different, concepts.\nPhysical quantities are measured in units.The dimension of the physical quantity is\nindependent of the particular units choosen.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "For example:\nBoth grams and kilograms are units, but theyare units of mass.And mass is what we'll call\nthe dimension.There are 5 fundamental dimensions that we\ncommonly deal with: length, mass, time, temperature,and charge.All other dimensions are obtained by taking\nproducts and powers of these fundamental dimensions.In this video, we'll be dealing\nwith length, which we denote by the letterL, mass, which we denote M, and time, T. For\nexample, no matter how you measure the physicalquantity velocity, it has the dimension, which\nwe denote with square brackets, of lengthdivided by time, or length times time to the\nnegative 1 power.Pause the video here and determine the dimension\nof energy.Energy has dimension Mass timesLength squared over Time squared.Okay, great, so what's the big deal? How is\nthis useful?Remember NASA's rover? Part of the landing\nsequence calls for a parachute to slow thevehicle down. Suppose it is our job to design\nthe parachute to slow the Rover to exactly90m/s. The terminal velocity of the Rover\ndepends on the mass of the rover itself andits heat shield, and several different variables\nrelated to the parachute design: the materialof the canopy, the diameter of the hemispherical\nparachute canopy, the number of suspensionlines, etc.For simplicity, let's suppose that all parachute\nparameters other than the diameter of thecanopy have already been determined. Our goal\nis to find the canopy diameter that is assmall as possible, but will correspond to\nthe desired terminal velocity of 90 m/s.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Clearly, we can't test our designs on Mars.\nThe question is: how can we get meaningfuldata here on Earth that will allow us to appropriately\nsize the parachute for use on Mars? How dowe predict the behavior of a parachute on\nMars based on an Earth experiment? And whatvariables do we need to consider in designing\nour experiment on Earth? This is where a problemsolving method called dimensional analysis\ncan help us.Before we get started, we must first determine\nwhat the dependent and independent variablesare in our system.The dependent variable is terminal velocity.This is the quantity that we wish to constrain\nby our parachute design. So what variablesaffect the terminal velocity of the parachute\nand rover system?The diameter of the parachute canopy is one\nsuch independent variable. Take a moment topause the video and identify others.Ok. Here's our list: canopy diameter, mass\nof the Rover (we assume the mass of the parachuteto be negligible), acceleration due to gravity,\nand the density and viscosity of the atmosphere.For this problem, we can assume that the dependence\nof the terminal velocity on atmospheric viscosityis negligible, because the atmosphere on Mars\nlike the atmosphere on Earth is not very viscous.If we wanted to derive a functional relationship\nthat would work, for example, underwater,it would be important that we include viscosity\nas an independent variable.Why didn't we include the surface area of\nthe parachute canopy in our list of independent", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "variables?Pause the video and take a moment to discuss\nwith a classmate.We didn't include the surface area of the\ncanopy, because it is not independent fromthe diameter of the canopy.In fact, we can determine the area as a function\nof diameter. So we don't need both!Question: Could we use the surface area instead\nof the diameter? Absolutely. We need the variablesto be independent, but it doesn't matter which\nvariables we use! The key is to have identifiedall of the correct variables to begin with.\nThis is where human error can come into play.If our list of variables isn't exhaustive,\nthe relationship we develop through dimensionalanalysis may not be correct!Once we have the full list of independent\nvariables, we can express the terminal velocityas some function of these independent variables.In order to find the function that describes\nthe relationship, we need do several experimentsinvolving 4 independent variables, and fit\nthe data. Phew, that's a lot of work! Especiallybecause we don't know what the function might\nlook like.But whenever you have an equation, all terms\nin the equation must have the same dimension.Multiplying two terms multiplies the dimensions.This restricts the possible form that a function\ndescribing the terminal velocity in termsof our 4 other variables can take, because\nthe function must combine the variables insome way that has the same dimension as velocity.And many functions\u2014exponential, logarithmic,\ntrigonometric --cannot have input variablesthat have dimension. What would e to the 1kg\nmean? What units could it possibly have?We're going to show you a problem solving\nmethod that will allow you to find the most", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "general form of such a function. This method\nis called dimensional analysis.We begin this process by creating dimensionless\nversions of the variables in our system. Wecreate these dimensionless expressions out\nof the variables in our system, so we don'tintroduce any new physical parameters.The first step is to take our list of variables,\nand distill them down to their fundamentaldimensions.Remember our fundamental dimensions are length,\nmass, and time.Distilling gravity to its fundamental dimension,\nwe get length per time squared. Now you distillthe remaining variables of velocity, diameter,\nmass, and density into their fundamental dimensions.Pause the video here.Velocity is length per time; diameter is length;\nmass is mass; and density is mass per lengthcubed.The second step is to express the fundamental\ndimensions of mass, length, and time in termsof our independent variables.We can write M as little m.We can write L as mass divided by density\nto the 1/3 power.We can write T as velocity divided by gravity.We had many choices as to how to write these\nfundamental dimensions in terms of our variables.In the end, it doesn't matter which expressions\nyou choose.The third step is to use these fundamental\ndimensions to turn all of the variables involvedinto dimensionless quantities. For example,\nthe terminal velocity v has dimension of lengthover time. So we multiply v by the dimension\nof time, and divide by the dimension of length", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "to get a dimension of one.We define a new dimensionless variable vbar\nas this dimensionless version of v.Now you try; find dbar, mbar, gbar, and rhobar. Pause\nthe video here.You should have found that dbar is d times rho over m to the 1/3.Mbar is 1. Gbar is v squared over g times rho overm to the 1/3., and rho bar is 1.Now we can rewrite the equation for velocity\nin terms of the new dimensionless variables.It is a new function, because the variables\nhave been modified. Notice that vbar is equalto gbar. This means that vbar and gbar are\nnot independent! So our function for vbarcannot depend on gbar. Also, notice that mbar\nand rho bar are both equal to one, so ourfunction doesn't depend on them either.This has simplified our relationship: vbar\nis a function of only one variable, dbar.And remember that dbar is dimensionless, so\nit is just a real number. This means that,phi can be any function.The forth and final step is to rearrange to\nfind a formula for the terminal velocity.The key here is that this equation for the\nterminal velocity has the correct units.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And this formula is so general, that any expression\nwith dimension of Length over Time can bewritten in terms of this formula by defining\nphi in different ways. Let's see how. First,create an expression from the independent\nvariables that has the same dimension as velocity.One such expression is the square root of\ng times d. By setting the formula for v equalto the square root of gd, we see that by setting\nphi equal to the identity function phi(x)= x, the two sides of the equation can be\nmade equal.And in fact, we claim that any expression\nwith the correct dimension of Length overtime created using these variables can be\nwritten in terms of this formula by simplychanging the definition of phi!It can be fun to try this. Come up with different\nformulas that have the correct dimension.You can even add them together. Then see if\nyou can find a way to define phi so that ourformula is equal to the expression you wrote.\nPause the video here.Now you may be concerned because this formula\nis not unique. We made some choices abouthow to represent our fundamental dimensions.\nWhat happens if we make different choices?Here we chose M, L, and T this way: M was\nlittle m, L was d, and T was v over g. Running throughthe dimensional analysis process with this\nchoice of fundamental dimensions, we obtainan equation for v that looks like this.To see that these two formulas are equivalent,\nwe set the arguments under the square rootequal, and find that we can express phi as\na function of psi.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So any formula with thecorrect dimension can be expressed by this\ngeneral formula.And this general formula works for any rover\non any planet whose terminal velocity throughthe atmosphere depends on the same variables.\nBecause it is a general law!Of course, we still don't know what this function\nphi is! In order to find phi, we can fit experimentaldata from any planet, for example, Earth.\nOn Earth, we know the gravity and atmosphericdensity. We can specify the mass of a test\nrover to be 10kg.Then we might set up Earth bound experiments\nby varying the canopy diameter of a parachutebetween 1m to 20m and measuring the terminal\nvelocity. For example, suppose we obtainedthe following data on Earth.Then we could convert this data to the dbar,\nvbar axes, by scaling the variables v andd according to the Earth values for the mass,\ngravity, and atmospheric density. We can fitthis data to some best-fit curve. And this\nbest fit curve is our best approximation tothe function phi.Now that we have phi, we can transform the\naxes again to represent the canopy diameterand terminal velocity on Mars. This is done\nby converting vbar and dbar to v and d byscaling according to known values of the gravity,\natmospheric density, and mass of the rover", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "on Mars!To find the diameter, we find the point on\nthe v-axis that corresponds to a terminalvelocity of 90m/s, and use our curve to determine\nthe diameter that corresponds to this terminalvelocity! Now we have the specification we\nneed to design the size of our parachute tobe used on the descent to Mars!In this example, we used dimensional analysis\nto restrict the possible form of a functiondescribing the terminal velocity of the Mars\nrover as a function of parachute canopy diameter,gravitational acceleration, atmospheric density,\nand the mass of the rover.This allowed us to design a parachute for\nuse on Mars based on Earth bound experiments.In general, the process of dimensional analysis\ninvolves... 1.Identifying the dependent variable and independent\nvariables,2.
