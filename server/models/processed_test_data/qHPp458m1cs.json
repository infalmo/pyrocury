number three,\nthat's what I call myself.I'm Ka-Yen.And I'll be teaching your lesson\ntoday because, well, Mike'sin Russia.So, yeah.Yeah, so I know you\nguys had your first exama couple of days ago.How did that go?OK, sounds good.All right, so we\nwon't talk about it.But because you guys just\nhad a super intense exam,we just want to give\nyou guys a break.So today, I'll be teaching\nyou guys a little bitabout nuclear energy.So this lesson won't\nbe super in-depth.There won't be a lot\nof crazy intense math.Actually, there won't be\nany crazy intense mathbecause we just want to\ngive you guys a break.You guys are going\nto be starting upfull cycle on Friday with\nreally cool topics like stoppingpower.So for now, we're\njust kind of like--it's a refresher.A couple of fun facts.A couple guys might already\nknow some of the conceptsthat I'm mentioning, because\nyou guys are intelligent people.But I walked into MIT not\nknowing a single thingabout nuclear energy.I was like, I wish someone\ncould have told me these things.So that's what I want\nto do for you today, OK?So I'm going to be talking\nabout the functionalityand the benefits and the\nproblems associated nuclear.But first let's start\nwith a very brief historyin a nutshell.So between 1895 to\n1945, that's really coolpeople were developing\nnuclear science.So people like Madam Curie\nor like Fermi, et cetera.They were all designing\nthis nuclear science,like they were developing\nit, which is pretty cool.Most of this development\nhappened between 1939 and 1945.Does anyone want to\ntake a gander as to why?What?AUDIENCE: Manhattan Project?TA: Yeah, exactly.But what field of the\nManhattan Project?AUDIENCE: Nuclear weapons.TA: World War two.Yeah.So World War two was\nhappening during those times,and they were trying to\ndevelop the atom bomb, which", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.231}, {"text": "is why the majority\nof nuclear sciencewas developed between these\nlike five or six years.Then 1945 to 1960.They've entered a phase of\nlike, well, the war is over.Now what do we do\nwith ourselves?So luckily we decided\nto redirect this scienceinto using it for\nenergy and harnessing itin a controlled fashion.So mainly the focus was\nactually for Naval submarines,but they also realize that\nwe can use this for energyas well, for\nelectricity as well.So there's a lot of\nreally cool thingsthat happened in\nbetween these years.So in 1951, the first nuclear\nreactor to produce electricitywas the experimental\nbreeder reactor,the EDR1 was\ndeveloped and designedand operated, and\nactually kind of worked.It was created by\nArgonne NationalLabs, which is in Idaho.And they actually still exist.So if you want to go work there\nthis summer, you totally can.And then in 1953,\nPresident Eisenhower,he created something\ncalled atoms for peace.So this is just a\nprogram that advocatedusing nuclear for things\nthat were peaceful,such as electricity instead\nof nuclear weapons and stuff.Also 1953 was the\ncreation of Mark 1.So Mark 1 is the first prototype\nNaval reactor that was created.It was created in March.And then finally in 1954,\nthe first nuclear poweredsubmarine, the USS\nNautilus was launched,and is up and running.So lots of cool things\nhappened between this time.But the real heyday of\nnuclear was actuallybetween 1960 to 1975.So during the span\nof 15 or so years,this was the real\ncommercial energy boom.People like Westinghouse were\ncreating nuclear reactors.I think the first one\nwas called Yankee Rowe.It's a 250 megawatt\nelectric nuclear powerplant, which is not\ninsignificant for a timelike the 70s.So other different companies\nand other different countrieswere doing this as well.basically, there was this\nhuge boom in nuclear energy.So if you look at this\nlittle chart over here,this is nuclear\nreaction constructionthroughout the years.So if you look in\nthis little chunk,you can see what a\nmassive peak there was.This was when everyone was\nbuilding nuclear reactors,people thought it\nwas super jazzy,and everyone tried\nto jump on that.Unfortunately, all good things\nhave to come to an end, though.From 1975 to 2002, which is\nabout this chunk over here,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.543}, {"text": "you can see a massive decline.And you can see\nthat nothing reallyhappened between the 90s and\nthe 2000s, other than the factthat we were all born.But no new nuclear\nreactors were beingcommissioned during this time.And then today, we're kind of--I say we're back,\nbut basically we'reentering what\npeople like to calla nuclear renaissance, which is\nbetween this chunk over here.You can see that there's\nbeen a slight increasein nuclear reactors\nbeing produced.But basically there's been a\nwhole new push for creatingmore advanced reactors.And currently, China,\nIndia, and South Korea,they are the main\nplayers in this game.So China itself has 32\noperate reactors operatingat the moment, and have\n20 more commissioned,like literally right now,\nwhich is kind of insane.So yeah, do you guys have\nany questions about this?Great.So what causes\nnuclear resurgence?This is the perfect time to talk\nabout why nuclear power's cool.Again, you guys\nprobably know this.But the main reason\nis sustainability.So right now we've\nentered a phase in timewhere people are\nstarting to realizethat we've done damage\nto our environment,we've got to fix this.So global warming is a thing.I promise you, it's\nactually a thing.And basically, we're\nlooking for a wayto produce electricity without\ncreating such a large carbonfootprint.So if you look at\nthis chart over here,you can see that\nthis is where nuclearlies in the amount\nof carbon that itproduces per-- what's the unit?Per gigawatt hour\nof electricity.When you look at\nthat in comparisonto coal and natural gas, which\nis our two primary sourcesof energy at the moment, you\ncan see that this is definitelymore attractive.So the statistic is\nactually that nuclearcreates 75 times less carbon\nemission than coal does,and 35 times less\nthan natural gas does,which is incredible and amazing.So that's the main reason\nwhy we're going for nuclear.But there's other kinds\nof really good reasons.One is the amounts\nof power output.You guys actually calculated\nthis yourself in pset 1.You know just how much\npower or energy comes outfrom one fission reaction.So just so you guys\ncan double checkthat you got that statistic\nright in your pset,it turns out thatIt turns out that you get\n3.5 million times more", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "energy than burning one\nkilogram of coal does.So you can see\nthat you definitelyneed a lot less fuel\nin a nuclear reactorthan you do in a normal\ncoal burning reactor.And then finally the last\nthing would be energy security.So one of the good\nthings about nuclearis that it can serve as a good\nbaseload source of energy.So if you're working\nin the energy sectoryou probably see this\nchart all the timeof like time versus like\nenergy that's being consumed.And it's kind of like this\nfluctuating little mass thatstays fairly constant, but\nat certain times of the dayyou need more energy than usual.So this is just the energy\ndemand during the day.That's what this chart\nkind of crudely depicts.So nuclear power is able to\nprovide a good baseload source.That means it can provide\nconserve energy at a reallyhigh level all the time.So this is why we kind\nof want to replacecoal and natural\ngas with nuclear,because it can take this role.Other alternative\nforms of energymight be better for the\nenvironment, it might be safer,and things like that, but it's\nnot really able to do this.So for example, if you wanted\nto replace all the coal burningfire plants with solar panels,\nif it's not sunny that day,you're kind of out\nof luck, right?Like you can't produce energy\nif it's not sunny outside.Similar for wind.If it's not windy\noutside, you'renot getting any electricity.Luckily for nuclear,\nit doesn't haveto rely on any of these factors.You can continuously\nproduce energy.Right?So do you guys\nhave any questionsabout what I've mentioned?Awesome.So now we'll talk a little\nbit about reactor types.I'll just tell you guys\nabout some of the main onesand how they work.So how people like to\ndivide up the reactortypes is in generations.So generation one,\nwhich, is all the wayover there, that refers\nto the trial reactors.These are the ones\nthat didn't reallyproduce all that much\nelectricity at all.They're more proof of\nconcept kind of things,so that would be like\nthe Mark I that Imentioned to you guys earlier.Now we move on to\ngeneration two.So generation two is actually\nwhat most of US reactors--the category that most\nUS reactors fall into.So these were developed between\nthe '70s and the '80s-ish, andthese are the ones that are\nfunctioning mostly today.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.118}, {"text": "And then we have generation\nthree, three plus, and four.So these are the new\ntypes of reactorsthat people are\ntrying to build onto create several improvements,\nbut we'll talk about thema little bit more later.OK?So I want to start off\nwith light water reactors,because these are\nthe reactors thatare most common in\nthe United States.So light water\nreactors, or LWRs,are mostly broken up\ninto two subcategories:boiling water reactors and\npressurized water reactors.So how you guys can\nthink about reactorsis that honestly they're\njust kind of glorified steamturbines.That's what they're doing.So let's start with\nboiling water reactors.So boiling water reactors,\nor BWRs, comprise about 21%of the reactors that are located\nand working in the UnitedStates.So it's a really,\nreally simple mechanismand we can walk\nthrough that right now.So over here, this little\nnubbin right over here,this is the fuel core.So this is what the\ninside of a fuel corelooks like, that\npicture over there.So the fuel core is\nbasically just a bunchof rods of uranium,\nsometimes it'sclad in something\nlike zirconium,and there's also control rods\nto help slow down the process.So uranium undergoes what?AUDIENCE: Fission.TA: Yes, fission.So what gets released\nduring fission?AUDIENCE: Heat.TA: And?AUDIENCE: Fission products.TA: Cool.And?AUDIENCE: Neutrons.TA: Neutrons, awesome.So those three things\nare all flying aroundinside the reactor core at the\nmoment as the uranium undergoesfission.So the isotopes, we just\nkind of let them be.Like I don't--I'm not completely sure\nwhat we do with them.We might filter them out, but\nI think they just kind of hangout there.The heat obviously\ngoes to create power.We'll talk about that\nin just a second.But the neutrons\ncome flying around.So those other neutrons can\nsimulate other fissions,and the control rods\nare there to make surethat there's not\ntoo many fissionshappening in the fuel\ncore at a certain time.Anyway, going back to the\nheat, the heat that getscreated during these\nnuclear fissions, thatgoes and heats up the water.So this is just one loop\nof water, basically.So the water flows through\nthe core and heats it up.It creates steam so the steam\ngoes and spins a turbine.The turbine creates electricity.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And it comes back\nand gets recondensed.That's literally it.That's all that\nhappens during a BWR.Yeah, that's actually just it.So a cool thing about the BWR\nis, because it's so simple,it's also incredibly--\nwell, not incredibly,but it is the cheapest\noption out therefor creating nuclear power.One of the downsides is\njust that it might notbe as energy efficient as\nit possibly could be, or notbe able to create as much\npower as it possibly couldif it was a cooler technology.But yeah.Oh, and another downside\nis that because wehave the nuclear material\ninteracting with the waterand-- so this is a coolant pump.This is a coolant tube.This is basically connected\nto a lake or an oceanor some other source\nof cold water,and that runs through\nthe primary loopto cool down the water and\nrecondense it into steam.If there ever is a\nbreach between these two,the chances of leaking nuclear\nmaterial into the environmentexists.Like it's not high\nper se, but with BWRsthere is a higher chance of\nleaking radioactive materialinto the environment.So that's one of the\ndownsides of BWRs.Do you guys have any\nquestions about this?Awesome.So I just want to show you\nguys this picture again,because here's the\nunderside of a BWR.I make it sound like\nit's super simpleand like a walk in the\npark, but this is actuallythe amount of\ntechnology that goesinto one of these reactors.Like look at all those wires.I don't even know\nwhat they all do.But it's kind of insane.So the next kind of reactor\nthat falls under the light waterreactor category is the\npressurized water reactors.So PWRs are actually more\nimportant, if you will,than BWRs.So remember, BWRs\ncomprise about 21%of the reactors in\nthe United States.PWRs comprise about 60% of the\nreactors the United States.But they are functionally\nessentially the same,and it's just slightly\nmore complicated.So over here we have\nour fuel core again,and again all it's doing\nis heating up waterwith its fission reactions.But this time this\nwater is pressurized.So does anyone\nknow why you wouldwant to pressurize the water?Yeah?AUDIENCE: So it doesn't boil?TA: Yeah, exactly.So when you increase\nthe pressure,you're also increasing the\nboiling point of the water,", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and that allows you to function\nat even higher temperaturesthan if you're working\nwith a BWR, which gives youmore energy efficiency.You guys will learn all about\nthat in 2005, by the way.So yeah.It heats up this\npressurized waterand this pressurized water\ngoes into a second loop which,again, just heats up water.That turns into\nsteam, that spinsa turbine that\ncreates electricity,gets recondensed, et cetera.And that's, again, all\nthat there really is.So one of the upsides of using\na PWR is, like I mentioned,the higher efficiency.But also the chance of\nleaking nuclear materialinto the violent\nbecomes mitigated.Because you have two separate\nloops with the nuclear fuelbeing more isolated\nfrom the environment,if there is a breach\nbetween the condenser loopand the secondary\nloop, not a big deal.Nothing really bad happens.You'd have to have breaches\nin both the loops, whichis very unlikely to happen.Yeah.So do you guys have any\nquestions about those two?Yeah?AUDIENCE: What's the standard\nlike operating temperatureof these kinds of reactors?TA: I'm not completely\nsure, but if you Google ityou should be able to\nfind it very easily.OK.So this next picture\nis, again, justto show you that like I\nmake it sound really simpleand like a walk in the\npark, but it's really not.There's a lot going on.So this picture over here\nis basically just showingthat there are a lot\nof redundancy systemsinside these reactors.Like we don't just have\none single primary loopand if it fails, it fails.We actually have four\nat the same time,and this is just called the n\nminus two redundancy, somethinglike that.OK?So the next kind is\nsomething much cooler.It's got a heavy water reactor.Actually it's just\na little bit cooler.But the main heavy water reactor\nthat everyone can kind ofthink of on their\nminds is CANDU,which is the one that's\nlocated in Canada.So the only difference\nbetween heavy water reactorsand the light water reactors\nas I mentioned beforeis that it uses heavy water\ninstead of light water.Does anyone know\nwhat heavy water is?AUDIENCE: Deuterium oxide.TA: Yeah, exactly.So it's just deuterium oxide.So remember-- I'm sorry,\nthis might seem inane,but this is water, right?And this is heavy water,\nwhere the D is justa hydrogen with two\natomic particles instead.So one proton and one neutron.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So the reason why they decide\nto use heavy water insteadof light water is\nbecause heavy waterhas a much lower\nabsorption cross-sectionthan light water does.So what this means is that\nwhen neutrons are flying aroundin the reactor there is a\nchance of it hitting a fissionproduct and a piece of\nfissionable materialand undergoing fission.But there's also a chance that\nthe water that surrounds itwill absorb that neutron.So if that neutron gets\npulled out of the systemyou're not able to\ncreate any more fissions.This is actually\nkind of a bad thingbecause the whole point\nof nuclear reactorsis to create heat and fission.So we don't want those\nneutrons to be absorbed.You can see, if you look\nat those statistics,you can see that\nthe absorption crosssection of H2 or deuterium\nis like 0.00052 barns,in comparison to H1,\nwhich is 0.332 barns.So I'm bad at math, but I\nthink it's like 600 times less,right?Maybe?Anyway, so you can see\nwhy deuterium wouldbe a good option for this.So because it's absorbing less--because it has a chance of\nabsorbing less neutrons as itundergoes its processes,\nyou're actuallyable to use a lower enriched\nuranium, which is really greatbecause that lowers fuel costs.Yeah.But the main downside of this\nis that, even though you'relowering your fuel costs,\ndeuterium is really expensive.It's about 1,000 or so\ndollars per kilogram,which is kind of ridiculous\nbecause a kilogram of wateris really not much\nat all, you know?So even though you're\ncounteracting the lower fuelcosts with higher water cost.Also, because you're\nusing your reactorwith lower enriched\nuranium, you actuallyhave to change out\nyour fuel more often.That fuel gets\nspent more quicklyand I'll describe\nthat in just a second,and therefore you just\nhave to keep replacing itmore often than you would for\na normal light water reactor.Cool?Questions about this one?Oh, I forgot to\nmention, but asidefrom that, everything else\nwith the heavy water reactorsand the PWRs, they're\nthe same mechanisms.And finally we're going to\nmove on to breeder reactors.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So breeder reactors\nare a really cool idea,and they were most\npopular between likethe '50s and the '60s-ish in\nthe very beginning of creatingnuclear reactors.So what breeder\nreactors are are,again, they're\nessentially the same thingas light water reactors I\nmentioned you guys before.But instead, now there's\ntwo little chunksof extra material.So do you guys know what the\ndifference is between fissile,fertile, and\nfissionable material is?Cool.All right, so all right, let's\nstart with fissile material.So fissile material is\nbasically just the materialthat is willing to undergo\nfission with a thermal neutron.OK.So basically when\nthe thermal neutrongets absorbed by this\nfissionable material,it's going to undergo a fission.Makes a lot of sense, right?So do you guys\nhappen to rememberwhat the energy of a\nthermal neutron is?You guys calculated\nthis in pset 1.Huh?AUDIENCE: 1 eV?TA: Lower than that.AUDIENCE: 0.025?TA: Yeah, 0.025 eV.Like super low energy.And while we're at it,\nhow do you calculate this?Bozeman constant times T. Cool?Whew.So main examples\nof fissile materialwould be U235 and plutonium 239.There's four in\ntotal, but those arethe two most important ones.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "OK.So this is the main fuel that\nis inside a nuclear reactor,but it's not all just U235.Like you guys have heard of--\noh, shoot, what's it called?Enrichment, right?Enrichment is\nbasically the amountof fissile material versus the\namount of other fissionablematerial.So moving onto\nfissionable material.So fissionable material\nis just materialthat is able to undergo fission\nafter the absorption of a moreenergetic neutron.So that's all it is.So that's all it is.So an example of\nfissionable materialthat's inside the other reactors\nat the same time is U238.So if a U238 absorbs\na thermal neutron,it's not going to do much.But if it absorbs a neutron\nof about like, I would say,like 2 meV, then it's more\nwilling to undergo fission.Cool?And finally we have\nfertile material.So fertile material is the\nbasis for breeder reactors.But fertile material is just\nmaterial that absorbs a neutronand then is able to become\na piece of fissile material.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.115}, {"text": "So for our purposes,\nthe main typesof fertile material we use\nare U238 and thorium 232.So if you look at\nthese processesyou can see that U238\nabsorbs a neutron,becomes U239, undergoes a\nbeta decay to come neptuniumand undergoes one more\nbeta decay to becomethe beautiful plutonium 239.If we start with\nthorium 232 instead,absorbs a neutron,\nbecomes thorium 233,undergoes a beta decay\nto become protactinium,becomes uranium 233, which\nis another fissile materialby the way, through a\nseries of beta decays.Cool?So that's what breeder\nreactors are doing.They're adding extra\nchunks of uranium 238and extra chunks of thorium\n232 into the reactor.If one of the\nneutrons-- so imagine--if you're looking at\nthe little fuel core,there's a bunch of neutrons\nthat are flying aroundand heat and other isotopes\nand things like that.So some of the neutrons will\ngo and create other fissionswith the material that's\nhanging out in the red.But other neutrons\nmight escape, and whenthey escape, instead\nof going into the waterdissipating and never to be\nseen again or being reflected,they instead create\nmore fissile material.So you can understand\nwhy this isa kind of an attractive\nidea, is that you'recreating your own fuel.You're able to work at\na higher fuel efficiencybecause you don't need to add\nin as much fissile materialsas you would for a normal\nlight water reactor.So people were really fascinated\nwith this idea, like I said,in the 50s and 60s.Because back in the\nday they legitimatelythought that we would\nrun out of U235.But luckily in the\n60s we discoveredthat we have a lot more uranium\nore than we thought we did.We're probably not going\nto run out anytime soon.And after that discovery, people\nwere not nearly as interestedin breeder reactors.The reason being is that,\none, because there's justthis extra material\nthat's hanging out,this extra material could\nbe more fissile materialthat creates more reactions.It's not nearly as\npower efficient.And it's also slightly\nmore expensivebecause you're not being\nable to be power efficient.And it also is better on paper\nthan it ever is in reality.So on paper you're\nlike, oh, this is great,", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.164}, {"text": "because I can just create\nmore fissile materials.I never need to add more.This is never really\ntruly sustainable.They always have to keep\nadding more fissile materials,because it's not as perfect\nas they want it to be.Any questions\nabout these things?Great.Cool beans.And then finally\nwe're going to move onto generation four reactors.So generation four reactors are\nall the new kind of reactorsthat people want to build.So the primary objective for\nthese new designs of reactors--like, the ones I\njust told you guysabout, they're\nall good and well,but we want to make\nthem better, right?We want to make them cleaner and\nsafer and more cost effective.Keep them robust\nyet sustainable,and also make them more\nresistant to peoplebeing able to divert materials\ninto creating nuclear weapons.So yeah.Here are the six\nkinds of generationfour reactor types\nthat were deemedto be the most promising.So there's gas-cooled\nfast reactors,lead-cooled fast reactors,\nmolten salt reactors,sodium-cooled fast reactors,\nvery high temperature gasreactors, and supercritical\nwater-cooled reactors.So I'm going to be\nhonest with you guys.I don't know all\nthat much about theseand I don't want to like\nspew out information thatmight potentially be false.So if you guys are\ninterested, one,you can talk to\nother lab membersor people in this department.I know they're-- mostly\nMike's group, actually.A lot of people in\nMike's group areworking on molten salt\nreactors so you guys can goahead and ask them about that.Or if you're interested you\ncan read more about themwith this hyperlink that\nI included over here.Hopefully he will\npost the slides onlineand you guys just\nclick it and there'sa awesome source all about these\ndifferent kinds of reactors.OK?All right.Any questions?Hi.AUDIENCE: Do any of\nthese actually exist,or is it all just theory?TA: I'm pretty sure that\nthey were just kind of proofof concept stage right now.Like there aren't any that\nare producing electricityin the United States, at least.Cool.Good question.All right.So all the things that we've\nmentioned before like how", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.112}, {"text": "great nuclear is and all\nthe cool applications of itand how simple and\neasy reactors are,why aren't we using more of it?So currently in the US there's\nonly 99 operating reactorsthat are producing electricity,\nwhich makes up about 19%or about 20% of the\ntotal electricityoutput in the United States.The main players\nare still, you wouldimagine, coal and natural gas.So this is actually even worse\nin the rest of the world.In the rest of world, there's\nonly about 440 reactorsspread around 30 countries\nand produces only 14%of the global electricity.So these proportions\nare pretty low.And you're wondering,\nlike, why aren't weusing more nuclear power?What exactly is holding us back?So it turns out that the main\nthings that are holding us backis just social, economic,\nand therefore like governmenthesitance to start using\nnuclear power more often.So the main reason\nwhy we're a little bithesitant to start using\nmore nuclear poweris because of safety issues.So nuclear-- none of us can\nargue that nuclear is like 100%safe.It actually does have\nsome dangers associatedwith it, which is why it's\nso important that we'redoing what we're doing.But if you guys\nlook at this chartthat I showed you guys in like\nthe first or second slide,you'll notice that there are\nthese events listed above.What are these words?Three Mile Island, Chernobyl,\nFukushima, what are they?AUDIENCE: Nuclear accidents.TA: Yeah, so they're some of\nour biggest nuclear accidentsthat we've experienced\nin history.And you can see that\nafter a nuclear accidentyou can see a\npretty steep declinein the amount of\nnuclear reactorsthat are being commissioned.So this is especially noticeable\nat Three Mile Island, whichis essentially the first nuclear\nreactor accident that we allhad to go through.You can see that, after\nThree Mile Island,you can see this\nmassive steep declinein the amount of nuclear\nreactors being commissioned.This is probably causational.We can pretty much assume that.And then you can see\nthat Chernobyl-- onceChernobyl happened, you\ncan see like this alsoanother massive decline.And again Fukushima, once\nagain, with the amountof reactors being commissioned\nafter the accident just", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.132}, {"text": "declines dramatically.So I'm assuming\nyou guys probablydon't know exactly what happened\nduring each of these accidents.Like you probably\nknow that they exist,but like what\nhappened during them?So if you do know, sorry,\nbut if you don't know,you're about to know.So Three Mile Island,\nwhich is the first one,it happened in 1979 on March 28.So Three Mile Island reactor is\na PWR located in Pennsylvania.So during this time it\nunderwent a core meltdown.The cause of this\nis just the factthat there was some kind of\nmechanical or electrical systemthat prevented coolant\nwater from beingpumped into the primary system.So because there\nwasn't enough watercoming to cool up the core,\nthe core began to overheat.So as the temperature\nof the core rises,the pressure also rises.So they notice this and\nthey're like, oh, shoot,we got to fix that.So luckily there is like\na little emergency valvethat you can see in this\nanimation gets opened upand pressure gets released.So that's all good and\nwell, but unfortunatelyafter the pressure's\nreleased, youshould close the valve again\nand continue operation.But it became stuck.So this valve became\nstuck and theydidn't realize that\nit became stuckbecause their equipment\nand their instrumentationwasn't able to detect that.So they continued to operate\nagain but this valve was open,so there was actually water\nthat was getting leaked outof this primary loop.So because the water\nwas getting leaked,they noticed that, oh, shoot,\nthe pressure is dropping.Well, what do you do when\nthe pressure's dropping?Apparently you have to\nmake sure that there's nottoo many vibrations that\ncould damage the reactor,so they shut off\nthe coolant pumps.Or they lower the operation\nof the coolant pumps.So now there's water leaking

meltdown.So the core melted down.That's never a good\nthing, by the way.Yeah.And yeah, so the\ncore melted down,the reactor wasn't able\nto operate anymore.But luckily at Three\nMile Island therewas containment that\nprevented radioactive isotopesfrom leaving the system.So they actually\ntook a brief survey--", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.19}, {"text": "or not a brief survey.That's probably a\nlong, long experience.But they realized that\nthe two million people whoare around Three Mile\nIsland at the time,within like a two mile radius\nor like maybe a 30 mile radiusor something like that,\nthey realized that theydidn't get much dose at all.They collected about a total\nof 1 milligram more dosethan usual.So to put that in perspective,\nan x-ray is six milligrams.So really nothing that\nhappened at Three Mile Islandother than they\nhad to shut it downand they had to do\nexpensive repairs.But people weren't hurt.The environment wasn't damaged.It wasn't that bad\nof a situation.I think the effect\nwas bigger in conceptthan it was in actual damage.Questions about Three\nMile Island accident?All righty.The next reactor accident, the\nbig kahuna I like to call it,is Chernobyl.So on April 25,\n1986 an RMBK reactorthat was located in\nUkraine exploded.So what they were\ndoing at Chernobylduring the time\nof this explosionis that they're actually\nrunning, ironically enough,safety tests.They were running the\nreactor at low powerto see how it behaves.So at low power, I don't think\nthey quite realized this,but the coolant\npumps in the reactorwere also powered by the\nnuclear reactor being generated.So if they're running\nthis at low power,their coolant pumps weren't\ngetting enough energyto properly cool the fuel core.So that was unfortunate,\nand they realizedthat this is a bad thing.So the reactor starts\nto go supercritical.So when they realize that the\nreactor was creating a lot morefissions than it should\nhave been creating,they decide to insert\nthe control rods.So thank goodness we have these\nhigh absorption control rodsto slow things down, right?For some reason, I'm\nnot completely surewhy they did this, but\nRBMKs, they have graphitetipped control rods.So as they lower\nthe control rodsinto the water, this graphite\ntip, which doesn't effectivelyabsorb neutrons, it displaced\na little bit too much waterthan was necessary, and that\ncaused the first explosion.So it went super duper critical\nand caused the first explosionat Chernobyl.Then, for some reason like\na couple of minutes later,there's a second explosion.They're not completely sure why\nthe second explosion happened.To this day we can't\nreally pinpoint why.", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.125}, {"text": "It could have been like\nbuilding up

critical\nmass was all blown apart,it was no longer super critical.It was fine.The whole debacle stopped.But unfortunately,\nthere was a lotof radioactive isotopes being\nspread into the environment.First of all, Chernobyl\ndidn't have the same kindof containment that\nThree Mile Island had,so these isotopes were\njust able to go everywhere.And also the second\nexplosion had a lot of steamwith it that carried these\nisotopes even further than theyprobably should have gone.So if you're looking at the\nstatistics of Chernobyl,it turned out that\n28 highly exposedreactor staff and emergency\nworkers die from this radiationor from thermal burns\nduring this time.And officials also\nbelieve that thereis about 7,000 cases of\nthyroid cancer that occurredbecause of Chernobyl.They're pretty sure it was\nChernobyl because theseare all cases that\nhappened in peoplewho are less than 18 years old.So you guys know that no one\nreally lives near Chernobylat the

there.It's a pretty\nradioactive environment.Luckily we see that there are\nanimals coming back now now.If you look on\nNationalGeographic.comthere's like little deer\nroaming around Chernobyl.But it's been about-- how long\nhas it been, like 30, 40 years?People aren't advised\nto live here still.So Chernobyl was terrible.Questions?Yeah?AUDIENCE: What does it mean for\na reactor to go supercritical?TA: Oh, yeah, sorry.So you guys will learn all about\ncriticality in a little bit,but basically when\nI say supercriticalit just means that there's\nway too many fissionreactions happening.Yeah?AUDIENCE: You said it went\nsupercritical because itwasn't being cooled enough or?TA: I think I might\nhave skipped a detail.It wasn't being cooled enough\nso the water was evaporatingand then it became supercritical\nbecause there was notenough neutrons being\nslowed down or absorbed.My bad, I'm sorry.Good?All right.So the next reactor accident\nthat we were alive for,", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "which is cool, was\nFukushima Daiichi.So Fukushima Daiichi\nhappened in 2011 on March 11,and Fukushima is in Japan.So these reactors, I think these\nare

broke.I think they're just like power\ngenerators on the side thatdid--yeah.They broke the cooling pumps.So there wasn't\nenough water beingable to go to the fuel core.This is a very similar\nproblem, as youcan see that in all these\ninstances of the reactorincidents, it's just kind\nof like the fuel core wasmisbehaving and we\nweren't able to getenough coolant water to it.So following the earthquake,\nthese coolant pumps broke.They're like, oh, that's OK.What we can do is we\nhave backup generatorsto continue running the pumps.It'll be all OK.Nothing will happen.We're all good.And then a tsunami hit.So it was a foot\ntsunami I think--I think that--15 meter tsunami, oh good gosh.So a 15 meter tsunami\nhit and it brokethe generators and then at that\npoint they're like, oh, no.So they

radioactive\nisotopes being spread out allaround the country.You guys probably saw\nthe lovely flow chartsof the radioactivity\nflowing out from Japanand making it to California\nand contaminating

from these\nsafety issues,these safety issues that happen,\nthey get elevated in the newsquite a lot.So these are mainly the things\nthat people who don't reallyhave any background\nin nuclear energyhear about nuclear energy.They're like, oh\nshoot, well this thingis going to explode\nevery 20 years.Like, why do we keep using this?Reactor accidents are\nactually pretty rare.If you think about it, it's\nbeen about 60 or 70 years,we have 440 reactors\noperating around the country.There's three main accidents\nthat have happened.But because these are the\nthings that people get ingrainedinto their mind-- thank\nyou, news stations--people think that\nnuclear reactorsare incredibly dangerous.And that's why we have this\nsocial hesitance, whichis why we aren't able to get\nenough government fundingand which is why there's\nall these bureaucracyloopholes to jump through,\nwhich is why nuclear power isn'tmore of a thing.Makes sense?Yeah.Another issue that's\nassociated with nuclear poweris nuclear waste.So what in the world\ndo we do with it?So first of all, the main thing\nin nuclear waste is spent fuel.So like I mentioned to\nyou guys, spent fuel rodsare made out of uranium oxide.But after undergoing\na bunch of fissions,these uranium particles get\ntransformed into other isotopesthat aren't fissionable or\nfertile or even remotelyfissile, right?So we eventually have to replace\nthem and add in new rods,and this is a process that\nhappens every 12 or so years.I'm not completely\nsure on that statistic.But the main issue's\nlike, what do wedo with all this material?So this material that comes\nout is pretty radioactiveand it's also\nincredibly hot, so itcan be dangerous if someone\ndecides to come and eat it.So that's why we've got to\nfigure out a way to expose it.So the primary way of\ndisposing of the spent fuelis putting it into\nspent fuel pools.So spent fuel pools are\njust giant tanks of waterthat exist at the reactor.So these tanks of\nwater are mixedwith I believe it's boron,\nwhich is a neutron absorber.They basically just\nput the spent fuelrods all the way at\nthe bottom of the pool.So this pool's about like\n20 meters high, I think.This is actually a\nreally good solutionbecause the water in the pool,\nit cools down the reactor rodsand also prevents\na lot of neutronsfrom escaping because water is a\nreally great neutron moderator.You guys all know this.It turns out it's\nactually fairly safe.", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.145}, {"text": "Apparently you can go swimming\non the top of the reactor spentfuel pool and\nyou'll be OK and notbe exposed to too much\nradiation if you want.So yeah.So this is the main\nsolution that peoplehave been using\nfor years, but theyrealize that this isn't\nsuper sustainable,because the amount of space\nthat we have in these spentfuel pools is not infinite.We have way too much\nspent fuel to beable to just continue to store\nit in these spent fuel pools.So like shoot, got to\nfind another solution.So the next solution\nwas somethingcalled dry cask storage.So dry cask storage\nis just a wayto keep this spent fuel\nsurrounded by an inert gas.And it's held inside a cask,\na cask just being probablylike a steel drum\nthat's bolted and weldedshut, and then there's\nadditional piecesof shielding around it like\ncement and lead, et cetera.So there's just\nlike gigantic tanksbasically that are\nsitting outside.So they put them\noutside the reactor.As you can see,\nit looks like it'ssitting in a parking\nlot outside the reactor.And so this is an OK solution.So basically what they do\nis they take a spent fuel,let it sit in the pool\nfor about a year or so,maybe two or three years.And then they're able to take\nit out because at that pointit's significantly less\nradioactive because, you know,you guys know how to\ncalculate this, too.You guys know like the half\nlife of different radioisotopes.You see that the radioactivity\ndeclines at a certain point.It's also more cool now so\nthey put them in these tanks,so they let these\ntanks hang out outside.And this is an OK solution,\nexcept for the factthat, again, we just have\nway too much spent fuelto be able to do this.It turns out that if you were\nto just keep all the spent fuelthat we create in\nfuel casks, it'dtake about 300 acres of land,\nwhich is absolutely insane.And obviously no one\nwants to take up that.Brief little side note, when\nI was googling like imagesof dry cask storage\nand I was lookingfor the different types,\nwhat I found particularlydisturbing was that there's\nonly two types listed:vertical storage and\nhorizontal storage.Like there's no\nother solutions otherthan these are giant tanks.Anyway, so people\nrealize that weneed to figure out\nyet another wayto dispose of the\nspent fuel, hopefullya way that doesn't get in the\nway of people's backyards.So the idea was something called\ndeep geological repositories.So deep geologic\nrepositories literally justmeans that they want to bury\nthe nuclear waste very deep", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.197}, {"text": "into the ground and never be\nable to retrieve it again.So the main push for this was--well, first of all, it's a\npermanent method of disposal.They hope to put\nit in the groundand never have to\nthink about it again,so therefore the\nregions that theychoose to bury in\nthe ground haveto fulfill a lot of criteria.So this criterion\nincludes not havinga lot of seismic activity.Because we are keeping this\nnuclear waste undergroundin these casks for like\nthousands of years,if there is a huge\nearthquake, those casks break,radiation gets everywhere.That's obviously\nnot a good thingso we want to make sure\nthat doesn't happen.We also have to make\nsure that there's nota lot of water\nthat leaks through,because the water can\ncarry the radioisotopesand carry them into the\nenvironment, which is somethingelse that we don't want to do.A lot of you guys chuckled\nwhen you saw Yucca Mountain.So Yucca Mountain is the primary\npush by the United Statesto find a deep geological\nrepository somewherein the United States so we\ncan deal with our spent fuel.So in 2002 the main\npush for this began.They spent a lot of money.They spent like\nbillions of dollarsfinding the perfect location\nto put our spent fuel.They had like nine\ndifferent locationsand they finally narrowed\nit down to Yucca Mountain.They're like, yes,\nthis is the one,and they started digging\ndown deep into Yucca Mountainand making this happen.But then things\nweren't as peachy keenas they hoped it would be.So Yucca Mountain is\nlocated in Nevada.People in Nevada weren't\nhappy about this.They're like, why are we\ngetting tossed on nuclear waste?We don't even have nuclear\nreactors in Nevada.This is not fair.There was a lot of opposition.And because of the\nsocial oppositionthere was government\nopposition and many loopholeswe had to jump through,\nand so it was justbecoming a huge disaster.They also realized that\nit wasn't as geologicallysound as they had hoped.There's a lot more groundwater\nrunning through and seepingthrough Yucca Mountain than\nthey thought there would be,so it's actually not as\nsafe as they had hoped.So there's a huge debacle.Basically the costs are rising,\nnothing much was happening,there's a bunch of different\nthings preventing progressionfrom happening.And then 2011, under the\nObama Administration,he just called it quits.There's no more government\nfunding to Yucca Mountain.It's been abandoned, as you\ncan see from this lovely Googlepicture.It's permanently closed.And you can also see that like\n14 people went out of their wayto review Yucca Mountain.", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.319}, {"text": "But we're actually doing OK.It's at like 3.6 stars,\njust like a normal motelor something like that, so\nthat has been abandoned.This idea has currently been\nabandoned in the United States.We're kind of still looking\nfor other solutions,but we really don't have it\nfigured out all that well.There is one other kind of way\nof dealing with nuclear waste,which is repurposing.I personally think\nnuclear repurposing isthe coolest option out there.And basically\nrepurposing just meansyou take the spent\nfuel and you chemicallyseparate out any material that\ncould be continued to be used--any fissile material\nthat could becontinued to be used\nin other reactors.So basically you\ntake the spent fuel--and it turns out that 96%\nof a used fuel assemblyis recyclable.So you take the spent\nfuel, you take outwhat it is useful, you throw\naway what's not useful,which is also still\nradioactive waste thathas to be put in a fuel\npool or something like that.But you have this\nprecious fuel that youcan put into another reactor.So this is actually\nsomething that Franceand other places in Europe,\nand Russia and Japan,they use repurposing\nquite a lot.For some reason the United\nStates doesn't do it.So the reason being is that\nthis is a really cool idea.It's like recycling.It's like very--\nit's very clever.I think I think it's personally\none of the cleverer solutions,but the issue is that it's kind\nof a really expensive process.So repurposing fuel\ntakes a lot of moneyand it turns out that the\nact of repurposing fuelactually costs more\nthan just buyinga new chunk of uranium 235,\nwhich is why we don't do it.It's not economically sound.So yeah.You guys have any\nquestions about anythingI've mentioned, about\ndeposition of nuclear waste?Almost done.OK.So all these are issues.Like, we have a lot of\nnuclear waste to deal with.It is kind of--there is an inherent danger\nwith using nuclear power.But the real thing\nthat holds us backfrom just having\nnuclear power everywhereand creating about\n90% of our electricityas we would hope it\nwould is economics.So in this world, money\nreally matters a lot.The economics of nuclear\npower is actuallya really complicated\ntopic and it changesdepending on who you talk to.There's a lot of factors\nthat are involved,so you can include\ncertain factorsinto your calculations\nlike, oh, the cost", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.212}, {"text": "of building the reactor\nin the first placeor like fuel costs\nor operating costsor maintenance costs or the\namount of money that comes outof damaging the environment.You can weigh all these\ndifferent factors in,and everyone churns\nout a different number.But basically everyone you talk\nto, if you look at this chart,yellow is nuclear\npower, the gray is coal,and the blue is the natural gas.But basically,\nanyone you talk to,you can see that\nnuclear is not nearly aseconomic of a source of\nelectricity generationas any other of these\nones I mentioned.Unless you talk to UK.UK thinks it's OK.But everyone else is saying that\nit's not as money efficient.So where are all these\ncosts coming from?So the primary costs\nactually lies with somethingcalled capital costs.So capital cost is\nbasically the sunk costof just building the reactor.Building reactors takes\nbillions of dollars.It also takes tons of time.And because it\ntakes a lot of time,interest rates also jack\nup that price even further.So basically it's just\nthis massive investmentthey have to throw\nin immediately,and this is where most\nof the issues lie.Like it's really hard to go to\nan investor and be like, hey,can I have a billion dollars\nto build this nuclear reactor?It's going to take\nfive years and it'sgoing to take 20 more years for\nyou to get your profit back.How does that sound?No investor is going to be\nlike, yeah, that's a good idea.That's the main\nreason why we can'tget nuclear up and running.We have a lot of plants\nand we have the possibilityto create a lot of\nplants, but we justdon't have the money to do so.Because it's a huge chunk of\nmoney, like I mentioned before,it takes a while to\nget your profit back.And also, if for some\nreason something happens,you have to stop\nbuilding your reactor.You just lost a billion dollars.Like, there's no\nturning back, right?If you look at this\nchart over here, whichis breaking up the\ncost of nuclear energyper kilowatt hour, I believe--gigawatt hour?Kilowatt hour.Kilowatt hour.You can see nuclear,\ncoal, and natural gas.So this giant white chunk\nover here refers to fuel.So if you can look at nuclear\npower, the majority of costactually doesn't come\nfrom nuclear fuel at all.It's just about $0.01\nper kilowatt hour,as compared to\nnatural gas, whichthe majority of the\ncosts of electricityactually come from the fuel.If you look at operation\nand maintenance,again it's not that\nlarge of a chunk.It's about the same as\nmaintaining a coal power plant.But then if you look at\nthe capital cost, whichis the dark gray color,\nyou can see how massive", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.175}, {"text": "that is in comparison to\nbuilding natural gas and coalfiring

the\nelectricity that'sbest for our grandchildren\nor something like that.Yeah, so that's why nuclear\npower isn't more of a thing,and that ends my pretty\nlengthy slide show.So do you guys have
