[{"text": "JOEL LEWIS: Hi.Welcome back to recitation.In lecture, you've been\nlearning about flux and surfaceintegrals in the\ndivergence theorem,and I have a nice problem\nabout that for you here.So I've got this field F, and\nit's a little bit ugly, right?All right.So its coordinates\nare x to the fourth y,minus 2 x cubed y\nsquared, and z squared.And it's passing through the\nsurface of a solid that'sbounded by the plane z\nequals 0, by the planez equals h, and by the surface\nx squared plus y squared equalsR squared.So often we call this\nsolid a cylinder.So it's got its bottom surface\nin the plane z equals 0,and its top surface in\nthe plane z equals h,and it's got a circular\nbase with radius R there.So what I'd like you to do is to\ncompute the flux of this fieldF through this cylinder.So I'll point out\nbefore I let youat it, that to compute\nthis as a surface integral,you could do it.You could do it.If you really want an\nexercise in nasty arithmetic,I invite you to do it.But you might be able\nto think of a wayto do this that requires less\neffort than parametrizingthe three surfaces and\nintegrating and so on.So I'll leave you with that.Why don't you pause the video,\nwork this one out, come back,and we can work on it together.Hopefully, you had some luck\nworking on this problem.Right before I left, I mentioned\nthat you were computing a fluxthrough a surface here, but that\ndoing it as a surface integralis maybe not the best way to go.And so, even without that\nhint, probably many of you", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "realized that really\nthe way that wewant to go about this problem\nis with the divergence theorem.OK.So in our case, the\ndivergence theorem--I'm just abbreviating\nit div T-H-M here--says that the double integral\nover the surface of F dotn d surface area-- so S here\nis the surface of this solid.So the divergence theorem says\nthat this surface integral,which is the flux that\nwe're interested in,is equal to the triple integral\nover the solid region D--so that's bounded\nby the surface,and so that's the\nsolid cylinder here--is equal to the triple\nintegral over D of div F dV.OK.So in our case, this is\nnice, because in fact,this solid region D is\nan easier to understand,or easier to grapple with\nregion than the surfacethat we started with, right?It's just one solid piece.It's easy to\nparametrize, in fact.It's easy to\ndescribe, especiallyin cylindrical\ncoordinates, but alsoin rectangular coordinates.Whereas this surface S, if\nwe wanted to talk about it,we'd need to split it\nup into three pieces,and we'd need to parametrize it.And it's kind of a hassle,\nrelatively speaking.Also, the divergence\nof this field Fis a lot simpler than\nthe field itself.If we go and look at this\nfield, all of its componentsare polynomials.To compute its\ndivergence, we takederivatives of all of them.And so that makes\ntheir degrees lower,and then we just add them.Life is a little bit simpler.So OK.So this process, using\nthe divergence theorem,is going to make\nour lives easier.It's going to make\nthis nasty surfaceintegral into an easy to\ncompute triple integral.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So let's see\nactually how it does.So let's compute div F first.So we know what\nthe integrand is.All right.So we need to look at\nthe components of F,and so we need to take the\npartial of the first onewith respect to x.So that's x to the fourth\ny with respect to x.So put that down over here.That's 4 x cubed y.We just treat y as a constant.OK, so now, we come back and we\nneed to look at the second one.So it's minus 2 x\ncubed y squared.And it's the second one.We take its partial\nwith respect to y.So OK.So that's going to be\nminus 2 x cubed times 2y.So that's going to\nbe minus 4 x cubed y.And then we come back and we\nlook at the last component.And that's z squared.And so we need to take its\npartial with respect to z.So in this case, that's just 2z,\nand so we add that on as well.Plus 2z.And in this case, not only\nare these polynomials simplerthan the coordinates of F\nthat we had, but in fact,we've got some\nsimplification here.Life gets really, really simple.So in fact, this is just\ngoing to work out to 2z.So the divergence here\nis very simple comparedwith the function F. More simple\nthan we have a right to expect,but in any case, good.It's nice to work with.OK.So that's the divergence.So I'm going to write,\nthis is the flux.These integrals that\nwe're interested in.This surface integral, and\nthen by the divergence theorem,it's the same as\nthis triple integral.So the divergence is this 2z.So the flux is what I get\nwhen I just put that in here.So flux is equal to the\ntriple integral over our solidof 2z dV.OK, so I've left some\nstuff out of this.Because I'm going to start\nwriting down the bounds", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and writing this down as\nan iterated integral now.OK.So we have to choose some\ncoordinate system in whichto integrate over this solid.And so we have three\nkinds of natural choicesthat we always look back to.There are rectangular\ncoordinates and cylindricalcoordinates and\nspherical coordinates.So spherical coordinates seem\npretty clearly inappropriate.Rectangular and cylindrical?You know, you could try\nand do it in rectangular.It's not horrible.But this is a cylinder, right?I mean, it's crying out for us\nto use cylindrical coordinates.So let's use\ncylindrical coordinates.So we're going to use\ncylindrical coordinates.So to get dV we need a\nz, an r, and a theta,but remember there's\nthis extra factor of r.So it's going to be 2z\ntimes r dz dr d theta.Right?This is dV.This r dz dr d theta part.So that's what dV is when we\nuse cylindrical coordinates.OK, so now let's figure\nout what the bounds are.So let's go look at the\ncylinder that we had over here.So it's bounded between z\nequals 0 at the bottom surfaceand z equals h at\nthe top surface.OK.So that's easy enough.That's what the bounds on z are.So let's put those in.So z is the innermost one,\nso that's going from 0 to h.OK.How about the next one?So the next one is r.So let's go back over here.So r is the radius here\nafter we project it down.And we just get the circle\nof radius big R centeredat the origin.So little r is going\nfrom 0 to big R.And theta is the circle.It's the whole circle.So theta is going\nfrom 0 to 2*pi.So cylinders are\nreally easy to describewhat they look like in\ncylindrical coordinates.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So let's put those in.So little r is going\nfrom 0 to big R,and theta is going\nfrom 0 to 2*pi.OK.Wonderful.Now we just have to\ncompute this, right?We've got our flux is\nthis triple integral.So let's compute it.Let's walk over to this little\nbit of empty board space.OK, so we have an\niterated integral.So let's do it.So the inner integral is\nthe integral from 0 to hof 2*z*r*dz.Well, that's not that bad.That's equal to--\nr is a constant.So it's equal to r z squared\nas z goes between 0 and h.It's dz, so z is\ngoing from 0 to h.So we plug in, and we just\nget h squared r minus 0.So just h squared r.OK.So now let's do the\nmiddle integral.So the middle integral is\nthe integral from 0 to big Rd little r of the\ninner integral.So this is the integral\nfrom 0 to big Rof the inner integral, which was\nh squared little r, d little r.OK.And that's not that bad either.So h is just a constant.So this is equal to 1/2 h\nsquared r squared from requals 0 to big R. And so that's\n1/2 h squared big R squared.That's the middle integral.So the outer one now.OK.So let's go back and look.So we're doing d theta as theta\ngoes from 0 to 2*pi of whateverthe middle integral was.So it's the integral from 0\nto 2*pi of whatever the value", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "of the middle integral was.So this is 1/2 h squared\nbig R squared d theta.And this is all just constant\nwith respect to theta.So that's going to be just\npi h squared r squared.You're just\nmultiplying it by 2*pi.All right.So pi h squared r squared.So this is our final answer.Let's just quickly\nrecap what we did.We had to compute the\nflux of this field Fthrough the surface\nof a solid cylinder.And so we had options.We could do it directly by\ntrying to compute the surfaceintegrals, but in\nthis case, lifewas a lot easier if we applied\nthe divergence theorem.So the divergence theorem\nsays that the flux-- whichis equal to this\nsurface integral--can also be written as\nthe triple integral,over the solid region\nbounded by the surface,of the divergence of the field.All right.And so in our case,\nthe divergencewas very nice and simple,\nand the solid regionD was relatively simpler to\ndescribe than its surface thatbounds it, S. So this is why\nwe think of the divergencetheorem.Because the divergence of the\nfield is easy to understand,and the solid is easier to\ndescribe than its surface.So those are both\nthings that makeus think to use the\ndivergence theoremfor a problem like this.So then by the\ndivergence theorem,the flux is just\nthat triple integral,and so we wrote it out here.We were integrating\nover a cylinder.So a natural thing to do is\nuse cylindrical coordinates.And then we computed\nthe triple integraljust like we always do.I did it in three steps:\ninner, middle, and outer.You don't have to do it exactly\nthis way if you don't want to.But it works for me.OK.And we got our final answer:\npi h squared r squared.I'll stop there.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}]
