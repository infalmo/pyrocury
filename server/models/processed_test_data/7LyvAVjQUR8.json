Thompson\nconclusively provedthat there is an electron\nby taking these cathoderays, as they were\ncalled at one point,and sending them through\ntwo charged plates.And he was able to show\na slight deflection.So these cathode rays, as they\npass through an electric field,change direction a little bit.And from the change\nin direction,you may not know the\nmass or the charge,but you can get the\nmass to charge ratio.Because if you guys remember\nfrom 8.02, from electricityand magnetism, as\na charged particlepasses through an electric\nfield, it's deflected.And the amount of that\ndeflection, or the curvature,is based on the mass\nto charge ratio.So Chadwick knew that\nelectrons existed.This was a known thing, as well\nas alpha, beta, and gamma rays.So the electrons that\ncame out of the nucleuswere later renamed beta rays.And at around the same time,\nErnest Rutherford and PaulVillard, working in\nCanada and France,discovered that there are some\nheavy charge particles thathave very little penetrating\npower, while PaulVillard discovered that there\nare some other radiations--I think he called it produced\nby disintegration of nuclei--that have very high\npenetrating power.And they named them\nalpha, beta, gammain order of their penetrating\npower or their range.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.412}, {"text": "And so it was later figured\nout that these were alsohigh-energy photons.So this is something to note is\nthat gamma rays, x-rays, light,whatever, it's all photons.However, once this pops\nback up, gamma raysemanate from the nucleus.So when we refer\nto a gamma ray, wemean a photon that came out\nof a nuclear interactionor a nuclear disintegration,\nnot an electron transition.So this is one-- this is what\nmakes a gamma ray a gammaray, is where it comes from.Otherwise it's a photon.It behaves just\nlike any photons.So what did Chadwick\nsee in 1932?This is the first\none-page articlethat he sent out to Nature to\nsay, I found something weird.So he found out that when\nyou take alpha particlesfrom polonium-- so let's say\nwe had a source of poloniumsending off alpha particles,\nwhich I haven't told youwhat they are yet.It emits a radiation of\ngreat penetrating powerwhen it hits a\nfoil of beryllium.And it was not known\nwhat these things were.So in goes the\nalphas to beryllium.Something happens,\nand something comesstreaming out that couldn't be\nexplained by current theories.It was also noticed\nthat when hydrogenwas placed in front of it,\nwhen a piece of hydrogenin the form of wax, which\ncontains a lot of hydrogen,was put in front of it,\nthe amount of ionizationincreased, as measured by\nwhat's called an ionizationchamber and an\noscillograph, nothingmore than an\nalmost-sealed chamber,a piston with some charge on\nit that would then deflect.As it were to pick up\npositive or negative charges,it would move\ninwards or outwardsand send an electrical signal to\nsomething like an oscilloscope.So this was a way that\nyou could figure outhow many ions were\ncreated by this highlypenetrating radiation\ninteracting in the ionization", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.454}, {"text": "chamber.And they estimated that\nwith the old theories,if this highly penetrating thing\nwere a photon or a gamma ray,it would have to have\nan energy of 50 times 10to the 6 electron\nvolts, or 50 MeV.He said, OK.Well, if that's to be basically\nthe experimental observation,say, a 50 MeV photon must be\nresponsible for the ionizationsthat we saw.And so again, this is\nwhat the experimentlooks like where you've got\na polonium source naturallyemitting alpha rays.They hit a foil, a beryllium.They produce what he did not\nknow at the time was neutrons.We actually do know that\nberyllium produces neutronspretty well.Beryllium is an interesting\nneutron multiplier.It undergoes what's called\nan n 2n reaction whereone neutron comes in, two\nneutrons can come out,and it transmutes\ninto something else.And we'll go over what\nthis notation means, whatthese nuclear reactions mean.If you don't understand\nit, don't worry.The whole point of today\nis to open up questionsthat we'll spend the rest of the\nsemester closing and answering.So again, if you're\nlost, don't worry.It's the first day of class,\nand it's your first dayof Modern Physics.So not to worry.And this is an actual\npicture of whatit looked like in the\npaper, a simple poloniumsource on a disk that was made\nby the natural decompositionof radium into polonium, a piece\nof beryllium, a vacuum chamber.Because it was already known\nthat the alpha particlescoming from polonium have\nan extremely short range.We're going to figure out\nwhy as part of this class.But without that vacuum\nthere, the alpha particleswouldn't make it\nto the beryllium.So that much was known.What wasn't known was why are\nwe getting so many ionizations.They attributed it to\nwhat they called a processsimilar to the Compton effect.To tell you what\nthat is, in 1923,Arthur Compton figured\nout, among other things,Compton scattering, where a\nphoton can strike an electron.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.227}, {"text": "The photon changes energy.The electron picks\nup some energy.They exit at very\nwell-known angles,and they transfer very\nwell-known amounts of energy.So this is how they knew how\nmuch energy the photon, if itwere to exist, should have.And they said the process\nwas analogous to Comptonscattering because\nthey said in this case,a proton would be ejected.It would take a lot of energy to\neject a proton using a photon.And Chadwick saw\nthis and said, well,if we ascribe this phenomenon\nto a Compton recoil,we should see about 10,000 ions.We actually saw about 30,000.So there was more\nionization goingon than can be explained\nby what's going on.In addition, those\nprotons shouldhave a range in air of\nabout 1.3 millimeters,and they saw much more.So this is something simple--theory and experiment\ndon't match.There's got to be a different\ntheoretical explanationif the experiment was correct.And so finally, what I love--\nthe last sentence in this--the quantum\nhypothesis-- a quantumwas the way they\nreferred to a photon.It was called a\nquantum back then,a little packet of energy.Can only be upheld if we\nforget about conservationof energy and momentum.Now, I'll ask you guys\nfrom 8.01 to 8.02.So Sean, when can you throw\nout energy and momentumconservation?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]MIKE SHORT: That's\npretty much right.You can't.A situation probably\nwasn't given to youwhere you can just\nthrow away conservationof momentum and energy.In fact, nature gives\nus three quantitiesthat we can measure\nand conserve--mass, momentum, and energy.And throughout this course,\nif something is not conserved,you've probably got the\nmath or the physics wrong.So this is something to\nremember throughout the courseand our derivations and\nin your problem sets,is conserve mass, conserve\nmomentum, conserve energy, justlike what was taught\nin 8.01 and 8.02.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.564}, {"text": "So I'll call your\nanswer correct.You don't remember a situation\nbecause, well, it didn't exist.And that's what Chadwick noted.He said theory and\nexperiment don'twork unless we throw\nout conservationof energy and momentum.Whether this was a kind of\npassive-aggressive thingto say-- well,\nthis clearly can'texist-- or he was suggesting\nmaybe it doesn't work,I don't know.I wasn't there.But later on,\nabout a year later,he published a follow-on\npaper confirming the existenceof a neutron by reconciling\nthese differencesin theory and experiment.So he restated\nwhat he saw before.This was the first\nparagraph of it.And again, it said that\nradiation excited in beryllium.Whatever happened after the\nalpha particle came out.It had a highly penetrating\nradiation, distinctly greaterthan that of any\ngamma radiation foundfrom radioactive elements.Something is different.And I want us to take\na sec to digest this.This is the part I actually\nwant you guys to read,so take a minute and read\nthrough some of this stuff.And then we'll begin\nexplaining his argument.Let me know when you\nguys are done reading.OK.I see some folks\nstarting to look down.So let's take this\napart and figure outwhat was Chadwick saying.He was saying that if a\nquantum was responsiblefor this energy,\na photon, then wecan write a nuclear reaction.I'll write it in the\nnotation that we use now,which would be beryllium-9,\nthe only naturally occurring", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.577}, {"text": "isotope of beryllium,\nplus an alpha particlewould lead to carbon-13\nplus a gamma ray.And that gamma ray\nwould take awaythe energy from this reaction.So now we can start to figure\nout, is energy conserved?Could this gamma\nray actually exist?And if it does, does it\naccount for the ionizationsthat Chadwick saw?So for each of\nthese isotopes, weknow a few different quantities.We know what's called its rest\nmass energy, which is this.It's rest mass times\nspeed of light squared.This should look\nfamiliar to everyone.I've seen it on t-shirts\nall over campus.And it may take\ntwo or three weeksto really wrap your head around\nwhat Einstein's equation reallymeans.It is that mass and\nenergy are equivalent.You can express mass in terms\nof energy, and vise versa.And you will be doing so\nto conserve energy and massin nuclear reactions, one of\nwhich is written right here.So if each of these things\nhas a given rest mass energy,let's say a rest mass\nenergy of berylliumand a rest mass energy\nof an alpha particle,and this alpha particle maybe\nhad some kinetic energy--it was moving pretty\nfast, so we'llgive that the symbol\nt for kinetic energy,because that's what you're\ngoing to see in your notesand in the reading\nand everywhere.And then this\ncarbon-13 nucleus hasgot to have a rest mass\nand a kinetic energy,and then this gamma\nray, it's goingto have some e gamma energy.Now, the question is,\nis the mass and energyconserved in this equation?What we're actually\nstarting to writeis what's called the q\nequation, or the universal massand energy balance for any\nkind of nuclear reaction.So let's say we have a\nlarge initial nucleusi and some small\nparticle i movingat it with some great speed.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.578}, {"text": "And after some\nreaction occurs, youhave a small, final\nparticle leavingand a different, large\nfinal particle leaving.They don't necessarily\nhave to be the same.Let's give these particles\ndesignations 1, 2, 3, and 4.In the end, we should be\nable to write the differencein either total\nenergy or total massof the system as this value q.q is, let's say,\nthe amount of energythat turns into\nmass, or vise versa.So let's say energy transfer.And so if we start writing some\nmass conservation equation,we can say that the\nmass of nucleus 1plus the mass of\nnucleus 2 shouldequal the mass of nucleus 3\nplus the mass of nucleus 4plus however much energy\nfrom nuclei 1 and 2 turnedinto energy into 3 and 4.We could also write\nthe same thingfor their kinetic energies.In this case, the\nfinals are on the end.So I'm sorry.I should use t for\nkinetic energy.So what this is saying is\nthat if some mass has turnedinto energy at the\nend, that energyhad to come from somewhere.It had to come from the initial\nkinetic energy or conversionof mass to energy\nfrom this reaction.And so notice that\nnow, you can actuallyexpress the masses of the\nnuclei in terms of their energy,of their initial and\nfinal kinetic energies.And this right\nhere is what we'regoing to be spending the first\ntwo or three weeks deriving,using, and exploring in order\nto balance nuclear reactionsand explain why they\nare the way they are.So let's make sure-- we'll keep\nthis nuclear reaction up here,", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.81}, {"text": "because Chadwick proposed\na different one to explainwhat he saw.And some of the\nevidence for thiswas that he put\nsome aluminum foilin between the beryllium where\nthings were being liberatedand the ionization\nchamber and oscilloscope,or oscillograph, as\nhe liked to call it.And that way, by putting\nmore and more pieces of foilin there, you can\ndeduce what's calledthe range, or the distance\nthat the radiation will travelbefore it stops by losing\nenergy through a whole hostof different processes that\nwe'll be working throughtogether.If this were to be\nascribed to a proton,then it should have had\na certain range in airby this curve b right here.Instead, he found this curve a\nwhere things moved about threetimes farther than\ncould have beenexplained if that\nwere a proton to beliberated by all this stuff.So he's saying, OK, something\nhas got more penetrating power.We know now that part\nof the reason for thisis if there's a neutron,\nand there's no charge on it,then it's not going to interact\nwith the electrons in matter.It won't even see them.Whereas protons or\nany other chargedparticles will see the\nelectrons in matterand will interact with the\nelectrons and the nuclei.So a little flash\nforward to say,we can explain this pretty\nsimply with what we generallyknow.But this was the\nfirst time somebodyhad to come up with\n[INAUDIBLE] explanation,and it was quite hard.And so moving on,\nhe can say, well, Iknow what protons should\nbe injected from paraffin.I know a formula to describe\nwhat quantum or photonenergy had to create them.And then instead, he says-- this\nis where his major hypothesisis--either we relinquish\nconservationof energy or neutron or\nadopt another hypothesis.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "And this was already put\nforth by Rutherford backin the '20s that there\nmay be a neutron,but there wasn't any proof.And this is what\nprovided the proof.He gave an alternate\nnuclear reactionif there were to be\na neutron which hadroughly the mass of a proton.Then let's write a\nsecond one down here.I'm going to erase\nthese extra notation,and we'll write the competing\nnuclear action below.And he said that-- let's say\nwe start with beryllium-9plus an alpha\nparticle could insteadbecome carbon-12 and a neutron.So I'd like to ask you guys\nright now to work this out.Are both of these reactions\nbalanced in terms of mass?Are there the same number\nof protons, neutrons,and electrons at either side?And just to let you\nknow, an alpha particleis better known as\na helium nucleus.So that means that\nthere's two protons.There's four protons\nplus neutrons,and beryllium-9 has four protons\nand nine protons plus neutrons.And carbon-12 has six protons.A neutron has zero protons.So in each of these-- and I'll\nfill in the other ones here.So that's a 4, 4, 2, and 6.Do we have the same number\nof protons and neutronson both sides of both equations?I see a number of heads and\none person saying yes, we do.So both of these reactions\nare balanced in terms of mass.The next thing to do is balance\nthem in terms of energy.Now, they can both be\nbalanced in terms of energy", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.472}, {"text": "because you could attribute the\nchange in the amount of massfrom here to there\nand attribute thatto the energy of the photon.That's when you'd have to have a\nphoton of energy around 50 MeV.But if a proton--I'm sorry-- a photon\nof energy around 50 MeVcan't explain what we saw.Instead, if there is something\nlike a neutron which alsohas its own rest mass and\nits own kinetic energy,and that neutron were\nhighly penetrating,it could explain\nwhat Chadwick saw.And so the masses and\nthings of these nucleiwere fairly well known\nback then to, well,six significant digits\nbased on some very carefulexperimentation.And all he did is\nsay, all right.Let's take all of the\nenergies in this reaction.Remember how I\ntold you over here,you can write any\nnuclear reactionin terms of its\nkinetic energies,and the difference will\ngive you the q value,which you can attribute to the\nconversion of mass to energy?That's what Chadwick\ndid right here.He took the full\nreaction, saying here'sthe mass of beryllium, the\nmass of the alpha particle,the kinetic energy of\nthe alpha particle.Note that he assumed that the\nkinetic energy of berylliumwas zero.It was just sitting\nat room temperature.Does anyone know the approximate\nkinetic energy of atomsat room temperature?Order of magnitude, even?It's around 1/100 to 1/1,000\nof an EV, or an electron volt.So when we're talking\nabout beryllium,whose kinetic energy, we'll\nsay, is around 0.01 EV,and the alpha particle whose\nkinetic energy was around 4times 10 to the 6th EV, you\ncan see why it's neglected.And you can do that too.You do not have to account\nfor the initial kinetic energyof a nucleus at rest.This is the first\napproximation that we", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.349}, {"text": "tend to make to the q equation\nto just have fewer variables.And don't worry if you\ndon't remember this now,because we have a whole\nlecture on the q equation.And so finally, he\nsaid, all right.We'll subtract all the masses.We're left with the kinetic\nenergies and a little bitof excess rest mass.That's got to be--this has got to exist.And so this inequality has to be\nsatisfied, which indeed it was.Using this inequality,\nhe said that the velocityof the neutron has to be\nless than its kinetic energyif it had all of that\nenergy, 3.9 times 10to the 9 centimeter per second.Indeed it was lower--not by that much, but it still\nsatisfied this criterion.So things are checking out.That's pretty cool.He looked at another\nnuclear reactionthat was known at the time.If you were to bombard\nboron-11 with helium,you end up with\nnitrogen-14 and either--either end up with\nnitrogen-15 and a photonor nitrogen-14 and a\nneutron, explaininganother reaction that\nwasn't as well known before.So I'd like to write\nthis nuclear reaction,because I want you all to get\nvery familiar with writingnuclear reactions.Let's say boron-11 plus\nan alpha particle--we'll say it has a mass of 4--becomes nitrogen\n14 and a neutron.We also have a\nshorthand of writingthis nuclear reaction\nwhich I'll useon the board for speed's sake.Usually if you put\nthe initial nucleusand the initial incoming\nradiation, comma,the exiting radiation,\nand the final nucleus,these two right\nhere are equivalent.This is just a shorthand\nfor nuclear reactions.This is what you'll\ntend to see because it'sa lot easier to write this\nshorthand and parse it visuallythan it is to parse a\nwhole nuclear reaction.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.365}, {"text": "So I just want you to know if\nyou don't know what these are,just remember to\nstick the arrow here,stick plus signs in\nfor the parentheses,and you've got the same thing.And using these, you should be\nable to very quickly determineis this reaction balanced.What's actually going on?And there will be tabulated\nvalues of q values or energyamounts for these\nsorts of reactionsin all sorts of tables\nI'll be showing you.And so finally, he\nfigured out whatthe energy or the mass defect\nof the neutrons should be.Does anyone know what\na mass defect is?This is another core concept.Let's say you were to want\nto make an atom of helium.So you would have to take\ntwo protons whose masses arevery well known,\nand two neutrons,and bring them together.So if you were to\nhave-- let's saythe initial mass\nwould be 2 timesthe mass of a neutron plus 2\ntimes the mass of a proton.And the final mass is just\nthe mass of a helium nucleus.You'll actually find that\nthe initial mass does notequal the final mass.In bringing nuclei\nor nucleons together,they actually release what's\ncalled their binding energy.It's what keeps the\nnucleus bound together.There's a little bit of\nmass turned into energy.And so you know how we like\nsay the whole is usuallymore than the sum of its parts?In nuclear\nengineering, the wholeis a little less than\nthe sum of its parts.It definitely is not equal.And Chadwick was proposing\nthat a neutron should actuallybe made up of a\nproton and an electronin very close proximity.And since the masses of\nthe proton and the electronwere known, he said, well,\nif we bring the proton", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.297}, {"text": "and electron very\nclose together to havean overall neutral\nneutron particle,it should have

the\nbottom, and the top oneis the [INAUDIBLE]\ntable of nuclides.Anyone seen this\nkind of thing before?We have posters of it down on\nall the first-floor classrooms", "start": 1560.0, "heat":

4.0026032 AMU.And this is another tip I want\nto give you guys right now.Don't round these numbers.That's one of the\nmajor trip up points.If you say that's\napproximately 4 or 4.003,you probably

MeV gamma ray,and you get the\nfourth digit wrongin one of your\nmass calculations.It's like that gamma\nray didn't exist,and you won't get\nthe answer right.So again, word to the\nwise-- do not round.You'll also see what's known as\nthe excess mass or the bindingenergy.So this binding\nenergy right here,if you were to take two\nprotons and two neutronsand bring them together and\nlook at the

electron.So once you get to around\nthe radius of the neutron,you might start to see some\ncharge, but not before.And so most other\nmatter, unless youhave a head-on collision with a\nnucleus, neutrons won't see it.And that helps explain\nwhy the neutronshad such high penetrating\npower or high range--because they just went streaming\nthrough most materials,invisible to the electrons.So

pursuing right now?Lots of really fun questions.And speaking of\nquestions, do you guyshave any questions about\nwhat we've explained here,how we've retraced Chadwick's\ndiscovery of the neutronfrom basic nuclear\nscience principles?So who here has seen these\nnuclear reactions before?Cool.This is something\nthat I hope folkswould cover in high school.But with a general\ntrend of watering downscience education, I didn't\nwant to make any assumptions.I'm glad to hear\nthis was covered.Was this coveted at MIT?Are you guys relying on\nhigh school knowledge?OK, good.Not good.Good I know where you are.Not good that MIT doesn't\nteach anything nuclearuntil year two.That's OK.You guys, along with\nthe Physics Department,will get at least a 20th-century\nknowledge of physics and 21stby the end of month 1.So I want to come back\nto the Stellar site,and specifically the syllabus.I've taken a lot of care to\nwrite a very detailed syllabusof what we're going to do,\nwhat I expect of you guys, whatyou can expect of\nme, and what we'll", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.252}, {"text": "be doing every single day.So if you want to\nknow what we'regoing to be doing, if you have\na class that you miss, and youwant to know what notes\nyou're going to miss,it's all written up here.I want to get right\ninto assignments,because everyone wants to know\nwhat am I responsible for.Well, not too much--nine problems sets,\nthree quizzes.The final exam is just a quiz.It's only worth 24% of\nyour grade instead of 20to get the math to work\nout, because I eliminatedone problem set to avoid running\nafoul of MIT regulations,but not assigning things\nat the last week of class.But there are three quizzes,\nso the final exam is justanother quiz.It's not a super\nhigh-stress, crazy thing,because I don't see a\npoint in doing that.You can make your\nassignments however you want.I don't care as long\nas I can read them.But I do ask that in the\nend, you submit a PDFfile on the Stellar site.And the reason for\nthis is my first coursethat I ever taught at\nMIT as a professor werethe graduate modules, 22.13,\nIntro to Nuclear Systems,and 22.14, Intro to\nNuclear Materials.I accepted paper submissions.And by week 3, I had\nto microwave them.Because three or four times,\nI definitely saw blood.And there were also\nsome weird stainsthat I didn't want to explain.So I added the habit of\nunstapling, microwaving,and re-stapling the\np-sets before grading.So in the digital\nworld, it's sterile.I'm not a germophobe.I just don't like\nblood in my house,especially if it's not mine.So I ask that you guys submit\nPDFs on the Stellar site.They're due at 5:00 PM to\nmake sure that you're doneand you can go home and relax\nor work on something else.I used to some have\nthings due at midnight,and I had every\nsubmission was 11:59 PM.I'm not going to\ndo that anymore.Do make sure to submit\n15 minutes early.So if your computer or the\nStellar site has trouble,send me an email or a\ntext or whatever saying,I'm trying to submit,\nand it's not working.Here is a backup, or I'm leaving\nsomething under your door.And if you want my\ncell phone number,", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.377}, {"text": "that's also my office number.It's also my only number.It's in the MIT directory.So if there is some emergency\nyou need to make me aware of,please do communicate.I'd rather you tell me than be\nworried about not telling meand then find out later.So are we all clear on that?As far as what the\nassignments are,each assignment is going to be\nabout 50% basic calculations,working out things like these\nto make sure you've masteredthe material, that\nyou understandwriting nuclear reactions,\nyou can balance a q equation,you can tell me about\nwhat your cancerrisk would be from a\ncertain dose of material.So this is like when you\ngo out in the real world,the sort of\ncalculations everyonewould expect you as a nuclear\nengineer to be able to do.And then 50% of each\nproblem set is eithergoing to be analytical questions\nof considerable difficulty.This is MIT.We're not just here\nto give you the basicsso that you can\nregurgitate a textbookonto the first person who asks.We're here to make sure\nthat you can go farther.Because you guys are\nthe future of this verysmall and diminishing field\nat the moment if you lookat the nuclear power in the US.I would say growing\nin terms of the world,but not in terms of the US.And you guys are going to be\nin charge of leading this fieldand determining where\nit's going to go.So you've got to be up\nat the cutting edge,and we're going to take you\nto the edge of your abilities.My favorite kind of\nproblem is to giveone sentence for the question,\nfive or 10 pages for the answerif you don't get the trick.Now, that's OK.It's perfectly fine\nnot to figure outthe answer in the end.In fact, I'll usually\ngive you the answerfor the analytical\nquestions because Iwant to see your approach.I'm not interested in\nyou nailing the answer.I'm interested in\nseeing how you think.And copious partial credit will\nbe given for the way you think.So if you have a missing\nstep, and you say,I don't know the step, I'm\ngoing to assume variable aand keep going,\nyou will get creditfor the subsequent steps.I want to see how you\nthink from start to finishand how you cover for holes\nthat you can't get through.So everyone clear on that?", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.216}, {"text": "Partial credit, yes.Use it to your fullest ability.The other half of\nthe problem setswill have take-home\nlaboratory assignments.It's not just enough\nfor me to tell youabout nuclear engineering.You have to see it\nfor yourself, and youhave to feel it for yourself.And once in a while, you'll\nget a mild electric shockby yourself if things\ngo wrong, but that's OK.It happens to the best of us.I got zapped by our--you guys have all made\nGeiger counters, right?Has anyone not made\na Geiger counter yet?Oh, OK.It sounds like we need\nto run another workshop.Well, our Geiger counters\nrely on a neat little boostconverter power supply\nthat takes 9 voltsand steps it up to 400 volts\nvia some switching things.That means you have 400\nvolts on a big metal tube.And if you're working\non your circuitand you happen to brush against\nit, you get zero current,so it doesn't hurt you in the\nmedical sense, but it hurts.I also have a dance I\ncall the 60 Hertz shuffle.It's the high speed\nshaking that youdo when you're\nconnected to 60 Hertzsomewhere from the wall outlet.None of you guys will\nbe exposed to this,but I've done it\nenough times that Ihave a name for the dance.If you get 400 volts,\nyou'll just kind of scream.And I don't care how\nmanly men you guys are.Everyone makes the same\npitch scream with 400 volts.We're all equal in the\neyes of electricity.For these laboratory\nquestions, I'mgoing to ask you to both\ncomplete an assignment whereyou'll, for example, measure\nthe half-life of uranium,measure the radioactivity\nof one banana, confirmor refute the\nlinear no thresholdhypothesis of the dose.And the experiment itself\nwon't take that long,but I want you to write it up in\nproper documented format usingthese sections.So I'm going to be\nteaching you guys howto write scientific articles.So actually, this is kind of\na good time to ask you guys.How would you define\nthe word \"science?\"Luke, what do you think?", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.167}, {"text": "AUDIENCE: It's a process\nof getting knowledgeby fitting theories\nto empirical evidence.MIKE SHORT: Gaining\nknowledge by fitting theoriesto empirical evidence.OK.So I hear knowledge\ngaining by some sortof well-justified and\naccepted means, right?Monica, what do you think?AUDIENCE: Science is the\nstudy of the natural worldthrough patterns and\nmathematics, I suppose.MIKE SHORT: Cool, yeah.Let's say the studying,\nmodeling, and abstractionof the natural world into\nways we can understand.Jared, what would you say?AUDIENCE: Which one?MIKE SHORT: Oh,\nthere's two Jareds.I want to hear both,\nand then I'll--yeah.AUDIENCE: Science is--I'd probably go with\nit's the same thingLuke said, gaining knowledge\nthrough experimentationand trial.MIKE SHORT: Cool.And other Jared?AUDIENCE: I think what Luke\nsaid about fitting theoriesto empirical evidence and\ntesting them that way.MIKE SHORT: OK, cool.I like these.And these are the\ngenerally accepted theoriesand descriptions I've\nheard of science.And I want to pose a\nquestion to you guys.If a tree falls in the woods\nand nobody is around to hear it,can it win the Nobel Prize?It's kind of an expression.So if somebody\ndiscovered the neutron,and they wrote up\ntheir findings,and proved that it exists,\nand they put it in their desk,and the house burned\ndown, and the person died,was the neutron discovered?What does discovered mean?So to me, science is\nequal parts everything youguys said and communication.If you discover something\nand you don't tell anyone,", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.228}, {"text": "the information\ntechnically doesn't exist.It dies with you.And you don't want\nthat to happen.So I want to make sure that\nyou guys both understandthe science and understand the\nimportance of communicating iteffectively to people.Because that's the\nother thing you'regoing to be doing as\nleaders in this fieldis explaining things.You better believe when\nFukushima happened--I was a postdoc at the time.I was not a person, I guess,\nin the academic sense.People here treated\nme very well,but I was also very aware that\nI was not one of the greats.Still I am not old enough yet.I was getting calls all\nday, all night from newsagencies saying, you're at MIT.I saw your name\non the directory.Do a radio interview and tell\nus all if we're going to die.And you can only imagine what\nthe professors on this hallwere dealing with.So folks were traveling\naround, answering thingsleft and right.I ended up doing some weird\npodcast on a Brazilian newschannel that I don't\nthink ever got airedand stopped doing it after that.You as undergrads even\nmight be called if somebodywants to know something.And so it's best that you\nnot only know the material,but you can convey\nit effectively,briefly, and in a way that\nyour audience can understand.The audience for these\narticles is any undergraduatein any engineering\nprogram anywhere.That's your lowest\ncommon denominator--not to say that\nthat's a bad thing,but it is the audience that you\nwant to aim your writing at.So what I want you\nto be able to dois say what you did, why you\ndid it, and what it means.In communication terms, this\nmeans a less-than-100-wordabstract, a very brief synopsis\nof what you did and whyit's important.That's the teaser.This is the trailer to make\nsomebody read what you actuallydid and see why they care.This is the main\nmethod and currencythrough which\nscientists communicateis articles of this type.An introduction and\nbackground whichsays why are we\nstudying this problem.And the answer is not\nbecause I told you to,and your grade depends on it.I want you to think about why\nthis problem is important,and put it into\ncontext, and give", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.355}, {"text": "any of the scientific\nbackground to understandwhat's going to come next,\nlike the experimental section.Describe what you did in nitty\ngritty scientific detail.This is usually the easy part.I put this gamma ray in this\nbucket, and it made this color,and I made this noise, whatever.A results section\nwhere you show allof your data and a\ndiscussion section--notice that these are different.You want to separate\nyour actual resultsfrom your interpretation\nof your results,because someone else may have\na very different interpretationof results--for example, Chadwick.Somebody found that\nberyllium bombardedby alpha particles\nemitted radiationof great penetrating power.That's the result. The\ninterpretation or discussionsaid it's probably a\nCompton-like effectfrom a photon.By separating your results\nand your discussion,you allow people to mentally\nsay, OK, I get your results.I believe that you\nfound these numbers.I have a different explanation.And you all may have\ndifferent explanationsfor what you see\nin your own labs,because you're also probably\ngoing to get different results.And then finally, a conclusion\nwhere you quickly re-summarizeyour major contributions.Your abstract is the teaser.Your conclusion is like your\nre-abstract with the contextthat people now believe--or don't-- what you did.And think about how\nyou guys read articles.So who here has read\nscientific articles before?More than half of you.Let's see.Alex, what do you read first?AUDIENCE: If it's a journal,\nprobably the abstract.But given that I'm mostly\ninterested in the topic,I tend to go to the\nconclusion section.MIKE SHORT: That's right.OK.I'm glad you said that.That was my next question.You read the abstract.The next thing you\nread is the conclusion.The next thing you\nusually read isyou skim through the\nresults and the figuresand see if it's\nworth looking at.Then if you're like, OK,\nthis is worth my time,then you slog through\nand read everything", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.36}, {"text": "to make sure you\nunderstand it all.So when you're writing\nthese articles,think about who's reading\nthem and how they read them.Because if you guys don't tend\nto read an article from topto bottom, neither\nwill your audience.And that's true.Most scientists skim things\nbecause we have a lot to read.So that's OK.And I am very interested\nin you guys completelydocumenting your experiment.Pictures are also\nawesome to use.Accuracy of results\nand analysis--so did you round when\nyou weren't supposed to?Did you have a clear numerical\ntypo that you can't explain?And the readability\nof the report--I want you to spend time\nmaking this readable.I expect that this\npart of the assignmentwill take roughly five hours,\nwhereas the basic questionswill take roughly three\nto four hours dependingon how well you're doing.And that leaves three\nhours of class timeand a couple hours for\nwhatever else happens in life,let's call it.Since you've never\nwritten these before--wait a minute.I shouldn't say that.Who's written these\nkinds of things before?Anyone here wrote a\nscientific article?Two.OK, three.Cool.So most of you\nhaven't, and that'swhere I assumed you'd all be.We have a whole lab dedicated to\nscientific communication calledthe Comm Lab run by\nsomeone, who happensto be my wife, four doors down.We live and work\nnext to each other.It's pretty cool.And you get an automatic\nthree-day extensionon the lab assignment if\nyou go to the Comm Lab.There are three\nreasons for this.One, I want you to\nget better grades,so I want you to learn\nhow to communicate.Two, I don't want to spend\ntime trying to figure outwhat you were trying to say.So better articles means\nless grading time for me.And three-- OK, let's\njust say it's two reasons.That's enough.And for everything\nexcept for the quizzes,it's perfectly OK\nto work togetheras long as you\nattribute who did what,you write your own articles,\ndon't Xerox anything,and say who took the data.So if the whole class wants\nto get together and take oneset of data and\nwork for that, fine.If you all want to do\nthe labs yourselves,", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.361}, {"text": "which I highly recommend, fine.But I'm not going\nto tell you howto do the lab assignment\nin this, as long as yousay what you did.And I want all of you,\nif you haven't yet,to head to integrity.mit.edu\nto see our official policieson what is considered\nplagiarism, what is consideredworking together, what's\nconsidered academic honesty.I will assume, because\nit's on the syllabusand I'm telling you now,\nthat you've all read this,and that there will\nbe no cheating.It's just not something that's\npart of my job description,and I don't want\nto deal with it,which means I\nwon't deal with it,which means the\nconsequences will be severe.So I don't think I'll\nhave to worry about that.And then for the late\npolicy, it's just 10%of the value of assignment\nfor each calendar day, noteach business day.So if you're running really\nlate and you haven't startedan assignment the day it's due,\nbetter to take the 10% penaltyand do really well than\nhand in nothing on time.So keep in mind how\ncan you maximizethe points in this course.I'd rather you hand\nin something good latethan

when the\nproblem sets are due.And Friday is\nrecitation activities.If there aren't\ntoo many questionson a particular\nFriday, I have a lotof fun stuff in store for you.For example,\ntomorrow we're goingto be talking about radiation\nutilizing technology, includingplasma sputter coders, one of\nwhich we have set up in my lab,and I'd like to show you.Because it's a way\nthat you can coatmaterials
