[{"text": "PROFESSOR: OK.I promised a video about\nlimits and continuousfunctions and here it is.So I'll begin with the most\nbasic idea and with a pictureinstead of definition in symbols\nfirst. So the mostbasic idea is that I have\na bunch of numbers--let's make them positive\nnumbers--and I want to know, what\ndoes it mean for themto approach a limit--capital A--as I go out this sequence of\nnumbers, a1, a2, a3, a4.And let me say right away, the\nfirst four numbers, the firstmillion numbers, make no\ndifference about the limit.So here's what it means.For example, there's a\nequals 7, let's say.What does it mean for these\nnumbers to approach 7?It means that if I take any thin\nlittle space around a,above and below, the numbers\ncan start out whatever.They can go in there, they could\ngo out, they could comeback, whatever, they could\ngrow way big, way small.But in the end, beyond some\npoint, eventually, they haveto get in that slit\nand stay in there.And the slit, then,\ncould be smaller.And then they would have to get\ninto that smaller slit andstay there.So that's what it means for\nthe numbers to approach A,that eventually after any number\nof jogs around, theyget inside and they stay\nthere, howeverthin that slit is.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.211}, {"text": "A slight difference when\na is 0, becausethe numbers are positive.They're coming down,\nthey get in.And again, they must stay in.And then, again, I'm going to\nmake the band tighter, andthey have to get into\nthat and stay there.And what does it mean for the\nnumbers to approach infinity?That means that whatever--so this is often\ncalled epsilon.I'll use that Greek\nletter epsilon asa very small number.So this would be A minus\nepsilon, and this would be Aplus epsilon.And then the epsilon could\nbe made smaller.And now here is some\nbig number,like even 1 over epsilon.So that's a giant number.And the limit is infinity if,\nagain, they can dodge aroundfor a while, they can go\ndown, they can go up.But eventually, they\nmust get above thatline and stay there.And if I move the line up\nfurther, they have to getabove that line for me to\nsay that the limit is--so I have these possible\nlimits.Infinite, some positive,\nordinary number, and 0.Those are possible limits.But of course many sequences\nhave no limit at all, likesine of n, it will just bounce\naround, cosine n--many, many things.OK.So I think that the way to get\nthe idea, use the idea, is toask some questions\nabout limits.And we'll see that usually the\nanswer is yes, OK, no problem.But once in a while, for certain\nlimits are dangerous.So really always mathematicians\nare looking for", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.301}, {"text": "what's special, what unusual\nthing could happen?Because the truth is, limits are\nordinarily rather boring.If the an's approach 7 and the\nbn's approach 4, so the a'sget close to 7 and the b's get\nclose to 4, then theirdifferences will get\nclose to 7 minus 4.But is there any case in\nwhich that could fail?Is there any case among these\nin which we could not knowwhat the limit was, and it might\nnot exist, or it mightbe like any number?And I think that can happen\nin this, so I've got fourdifferent questions\nhere, getting moreinteresting as we go down.In the first one, I can\nsee only one problem.If the a's approach infinity, so\nthey get very big, and theb's also approach infinity, get\nvery big, so capital A andcapital B become formally\ninfinity minus infinity, andwe don't know the\nanswer there.That has no meaning.So this'll be my little\nlist of danger.I mean, it's not like\nskydiving, but for amathematician this\nis high risk.OK, so how could this happen?Well, the an might\nbe n squared.And the bn might be only n.Right?So they're both going to\ninfinity, n squared and n.But n squared is going faster.It's like a race.n squared will win, and the\ndifference between them willactually grow faster\nand faster.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.339}, {"text": "Or they could go to\ninfinity together.an and bn could both be n,\nboth headed for infinity.The differences would be\n0 all along, n minus n.So the limit of the difference\nwould be 0 minus 0.So this could be 0, but it could\nbe infinity, it could beminus infinity, it could\nbe anything.Any limit is possible there.Do you see that there\nis a case--it's sort of a special case,\nbecause it only happens whenthese limits are infinite--but now it's sort of OK\nto look at each--let me look at number two.How about multiplication?If I multiply a bunch of numbers\nthat are headed for 7and a bunch of numbers that\nare headed for 4, theirproduct is going\nto head for 28.This will be true.When could it fail?Well, again, it's going to be\nextreme cases, because if Ihave ordinary numbers for\nA and B like 7 and4, there's no doubt.But look at the extreme\ncase of when Ais 0 and B is infinite.So the an's are headed for 0.The bn's are getting bigger\nand bigger, the an's aregetting small as we\ngo far enough out.OK.In that case, well,\nagain it's a race.The an's might be 1 over\nn squared, and thebn's might be n.So this would be n over\nn squared, andthat would go to 0.But if I reverse those I could\nhave n squared times 1 over n.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.261}, {"text": "The product could get bigger,\nor the product could--all possibilities.All possibilities there.So I cannot know what\nthat one is.0 times infinity\nis meaningless.OK.What about number three?The danger increases as soon\nas we start dividing.I made the b's positive,\nbut I don't know ifcapital B is positive.So the danger--and, in fact, the most important\ncase for calculus--is 0 over 0.If the a's go to 0 and the b's\ngo to 0, I can't tell whattheir ratio goes to, because it\ndepends how fast they go.If the a's go quickly to 0 and\nthe b's are rather slowgetting there--in other words the b's would be\na lot bigger than the a'seven though both are\ngoing to 0--then that fraction\nwould be small.But if I reverse them, the\nfraction would be large.So I think 0 over\n0 is a danger.I think there's another\ndanger here.Yeah, maybe infinity\nover infinity.Again, that's a race that we\ncan't tell, until we knowdetails about the sequences,\nwho's going to win.If they an's go off to infinity\nand the bn's go offto infinity, ah, a very\nimportant case.The ratio could be\n1 all along.The a's and b's could be the\nsame, headed for infinity.Or the an's might be squaring\nthe b's and going up faster,or the square root of the\nb's and going slower.So again, infinity over\ninfinity, we can't--0 over infinity, if the a's are\nheaded for 0 and the b's", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.225}, {"text": "are headed big, then that ratio\nis going to be small andhead for 0.0 over infinity, I'm OK with.Call it 0.Well, I don't know if\nthat's legal, butanyway, let me do it.All right, last one of\nthis kind, just forpractice about limits.Again, you see what I'm\nconstantly doing is thinkingof examples that simply\nshow that I can'tbe sure of the limit.So here normally I could be\nsure, if this is headed for 7to the fourth, that'll be the\nlimit, whatever that is, 49squared, 2401, or something.But if--now when could it go wrong?Here's an interesting case.So this is my list of danger,\nand I think I'm in danger ifthey both go to 0.0 to the 0-th power, I don't\nknow what that is.And actually, I don't know all\nthe possibilities here.I can see one way would be let's\nsuppose the b's wereactually 0, or practically.Then things to the\n0 power are 1.So I could get the answer 1 here\nby fixing the b's at 0and letting these guys, they\nwould all be to the 0 power,so they would all be 1.And in the limit,\nI would have 1.But I could also do\nit differently.I could fix these at 0 and let\nthese guys get smaller.Then I would have 0 to powers.And zero to any power is 0.You see my little\nproblem here?Let me write my little\nproblem here.My problem is that a to the 0\npower would be 1, but 0 to the", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.218}, {"text": "a-th power would be 0, or 0 to\nthe b-th, maybe I should say.So if I'm in this situation and\nthe a is shrinking to 0, Istill have a limit of 1's.But if I'm in this situation and\nthe b's are headed for 0,I have a limit of 0's.And maybe you could get\n1/2, I don't know how.And you have to allow me--\nbecause I have to finish thislist, and I only have one\nmore to tell you--that another case, a very\ninteresting type of calculuscase is the case where\nthe a's go to 1 andthe b's go to infinity.I don't know if you remember\nthat this actually happened inthe lecture on e, the number\nthat comes in e to the x, thegreat number of calculus.Do you remember that?So I'm going to talk a little\nbit about the a's going to 1and the b's blowing up.So I'm getting things that are\nvery near 1, but I'm takingmany, many more of them.And I believe that I can\nget all kinds ofdifferent limits there.I believe I can get all kinds\nof different limits.Do you just--maybe on this next board.And then I promise to come\nback to the heart of thesubject of limits and continuous\nfunctions.But I just think that one, the\nfamous case of this one, was 1plus 1 over n.That's the a's, and that\napproaches what limit?One.The b's I'm going\nto take as n.So the b's are going\nto infinity.So I'm discussing\nthis case here.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.285}, {"text": "So that's a case where\nthis goes to 1,this goes to infinity.I had an email this week saying,\nwait a minute, I'vegot a little problem here,\nbecause I know 1 to theinfinity is e.1 to the infinity is 3.Well, that's because it's true\nthat that number approaches e.That's one of the many\nremarkable ways to produce thenumber e, the 2.7-something.But that's because the race\nbetween this and this was soevenly balanced.If I took these closer and\ncloser to 1, like n squared,what would happen then?Then I'm taking numbers very,\nvery near 1, I'm taking apower, but these are sort of\nnear, those would approach--would you like to guess?One.These are so close to 1 that\ntaking the nth power doesn'tmove them far.And you can guess that I could\nget infinity too, by taking nnot still close to 1\nand taking some bigpower like n squared.Now I have things close to 1,\nbut I'm taking so many of themthat it would blow up.So again i think--So those are\nall cases where in the limit,I have 1, in the limit,\nI have infinity.But that combination 1 to the\nincreasingly high powers cando different things.This was my little idea to\nshow you the risky cases.OK.But actually, 0 over 0, that's\nwhat calculus isalways doing, right?", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.286}, {"text": "Because that's exactly what we\nhave when we have

one.OK.So I now want to speak\nabout the case when fof x goes to 0.Let's say f of x goes\nto 0 as x goes to 0.So there'll be an if here.I have to say what that means.And then I'm also going to have\nsome g of x going to 0 asx goes to 0.OK, so both functions\nare decreasing.And my question, let me ask the\nquestion first, what aboutf of x over g of x?What does that do?And of course, just as
