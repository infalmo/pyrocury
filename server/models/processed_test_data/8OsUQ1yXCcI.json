[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Determinism.And it all begins with photons.Einstein reluctantly\ncame up with the ideathat light was made of quanta--quanta of light called photons.Now when you think of photons,\nwe think of a particle.So everybody knew\nthat light was a wave.Maxwell's equations\nhad been so successful.Nevertheless,\nphotoelectric effect--Planck's work-- all were leading\nto the idea that, in some ways,photons were also particles.So when you think of a\nparticle, however, thereis an important difference\nbetween a particlein the sense of Newton, which\nis an object with zero size thatcarries energy and\nhas a precise positionand velocity at any time, and\nthe quantum mechanical ideaof particle, which is just some\nindivisible amount of energyor momentum that propagates.So light was made of photons--packets of energy.And a photon is a particle--\na quantum mechanical particle.Not in the sense that maybe\nit has position and velocitydetermined or it's\na point particle,but more like a packet\nthat is indivisible.You cannot decompose\nit in further packets.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So Einstein realized\nthat for a photon,the energy was given by h nu.Where nu is the\nfrequency of the lightthat this photon is\nhelping build up.So if you have a\nbeam of light, youshould think it's\nbillions of photons.And according to the\nfrequency of that lightthat is related to\nthe wavelength--by the equation frequency\ntimes wavelengthis velocity of light--you typically know, for\nlight, the wavelength,and you know the\nfrequency, and thenyou know the energy of\neach of the photons.The photons have very,\nvery little energy.We have very, very\nlittle energy,but your eyes are very\ngood detectors of photons.If you're in a totally\ndark room, your eye,probably, can take as\nlittle as five photonsif they hit your retina.So it's a pretty good\ndetector of photons.Anyway, the thing that\nI want to explain hereis what happens if a beam\nof light hits a polarizer.So what is a polarizer?It's a sheet of plastic\nor some material.It has a preferential direction.Let me align that preferential\ndirection with the x-axis,and that's a polarizer.And if I send light\nthat is linearlypolarized along the x-axis,\nit all goes through.If I send light linearly\npolarized along the y-axis,nothing goes through.It all gets absorbed.That's what a polarizer\ndoes for a living.In fact, if you send\nlight in this direction,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "the light that comes out\nis identical to the lightthat came in.The frequency doesn't change.The wavelength doesn't change.It's the same light,\nthe same energy.So far, so good.Now let's imagine that we send\nin light linearly polarizedat some angle alpha.So we send an electric\nfield E alpha,which is E0 cosine alpha x\nhat plus E0 sine alpha y hat.Well, you've studied\nelectromagnetism,and you know that this thing,\nbasically, will come aroundand say, OK, you can go\nthrough because you'realigning the right\ndirection, but youare orthogonal to my\npreferential direction,or orthogonal I absorbed,\nso this disappears.So after the polarizer, E is\njust E0 cosine alpha x hat.That's all that is left\nafter the polarizer.Well here is something\ninteresting--you know that the energy\non electromagnetic fieldis proportional to the\nmagnitude of the electric fieldsquare, that's what it is.So the magnitude of\nthis electric field--if you can notice,\nit's the square rootof the sum of the\nsquares will give youE0 as the magnitude of\nthis full electric field.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "But this electric field has\nmagnitude E0 cosine alpha.So the fraction of power--fraction of energy through\nis cosine alpha squared.The energy is always\nproportional to the square.So the square of this is E0\nsquared cosine squared alpha.And for this one, the\nmagnitude of it is E0,so you divide by E0 and cosine\nalpha is the right thing.This is the fraction\nof the energy.If alpha is equal to 0,\nyou get cosine of 01.You get all the energy 1.If alpha is equal to\npi over 2, the lightis polarized along\nthe y direction,nothing goes through--indeed, cosine of pi over 2 is\n0, and nothing goes through.So the fraction of\nenergy that goes throughis cosine squared alpha.But now, think what\nthis means for photons.What it means for\nphotons is somethingextraordinarily strange.And so strange that it's\nalmost unbelievable that weget so easily in trouble.Here is this light\nbeam over here,and it's made up of photons.All identical photons,\nmaybe billions of photons,but all identical.And now, think of sending\nthis light beam over there--a billion identical photons--\nyou send them one by one", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "into the state, and\nsee what happens.You know what has to happen,\nbecause classical behavior isabout right.This fraction of the\nphotons must go through,and 1 minus that\nmust not go through.You see, it cannot be there\ncomes a photon and half of itgoes through, because there's\nno such thing as half of it.If there would be\nhalf of it, it wouldbe half the energy and,\ntherefore, different color.And we know that\nafter a polarizer,the color doesn't change.So here is the situation.You're sending a billion\nphotons and, say, one-thirdhas to get through.But now, the photos\nare identical.How can that happen\nin classical physics?If you send identical photos,\nwhatever happens to a photonwill happen to all, but the\nphoton either gets absorbedor goes through.And if it gets absorbed,\nthen all should get absorbed.And if it goes through,\nall should go throughbecause they are all identical.And now you have\nfound a situationwhich identical\nset of experimentswith identically\nprepared objectssometimes gives you\ndifferent results.It's a debacle.It's a total disaster.What seems to have\nhappened here--you suddenly have\nidentical photons,and sometimes they go\nthrough, and sometimes theydon't go through.And therefore, you've\nlost predictability.It's so simple to show\nthat if photons exist,you lose predictability.And that's what\ndrove Einstein crazy.He knew when he\nentered these photonsthat he was getting in trouble.He was going to get in trouble\nwith classical physics.So possible ways out--", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "people speculate about it--people said, well, yes,\nthe photos are identical,but the polarizer\nhas substructure.If it hits in this interatomic\npart, it goes through,and in that interatomic\npart, it doesn't go through.People did experiments\nmany times.It's not true.The polarizer is like that.And then came a more\noutrageous propositionby Einstein and others--that there are hidden variables.You think the photons\nare identical,but a photon has a hidden\nvariable-- a propertyyou don't know about.If you knew that property\nabout the photon,you would be able to\ntell if it goes throughor it doesn't go through.But you don't know it,\nso that's why you'restuck with probabilities.It's because the quantum\ntheory is not complete.There are hidden variables.And once you put the\nhidden variables,you'll discover the photon\nhas more something inside it,and they are not the same,\neven though they look the same.And that's a hidden\nvariable theory.And it sounds so philosophical\nthat you would think, well,if you don't know about\nthem, but they are there,these properties, how could\nyou ever know they are there?And the great progress of John\nBell with the Bell inequalitiesis that he demonstrated that\nthat would not fix the problem.Quantum mechanics cannot be\nmade deterministic with hiddenvariables.It was an unbelievable result--the result of John Bell.So

determinism.We can only predict\nprobabilities.So photons either\ngets through or not,and can only predict\nprobabilities.Now we write, in classical\nphysics, a beam like that.But how do we write the\nwave function of a photon?Well, this is quite interesting.We think of states of a\nparticle as wave functions.And I will call them,\nsometimes, states;I will call them,\nsometimes, wave functions;and I sometimes will\ncall them vectors.Why vector?Because the main thing\nyou do with vectorsis adding them or multiplying\nthem by numbers to scale them.And that's exactly what you\ncan do with a linear equation.So that's why people think\nof states, or wave functions,as vectors.And Dirac invented\na notation in whichto describe a photon\npolarized in the x direction,you would simply write\nsomething like this.Photon colon x and this object--you think of it as some\nvector or wave function,and it represents a\nphoton in the x direction.And we're not saying yet\nwhat kind of vector

sine alpha photon y,\nin which I've superposedone state with another--created a sum-- and this I\ncall the photon state polarizedin the alpha direction.So this is how, in quantum\nmechanics, you think of this--photons-- we will elaborate that\nand compare with this equation.It's kind of interesting.What you lose here is this ease.There's no ease there\nbecause it's one photon.When you have a\nbig electric field,I don't know how many\nphotons there are.I would have to calculate\nthe energy of this beamand find the frequency\nthat I didn't specify,and see how many photons.But each photon in
