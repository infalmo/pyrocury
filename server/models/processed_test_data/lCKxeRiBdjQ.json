[{"text": "CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome\nback to recitation.In this video, I'd like us to\nwork on the following problem:So given the region\nR shown below,which I'll mention\nmore of in a moment,compute the integral\ndouble integralover R of the\nquantity 4 x squaredminus y squared to\nthe fourth dx dy,and I want you to do it\nby changing variables to uis equal 2x minus y and\nv is equal to 2x plus y.And the region,\ndefined down here,is just these\nthree line segmentsand the intersection\nof the region boundedby these three line segments.So one of them is a portion\nof the y-axis, one of the themis a portion of the line\ndefined by 2x minus y equals 0,and one of them is a\nportion of the line definedby 2x plus y equals 2.So why don't you do\nthis, make sure youuse this change of variables,\nand then I'll come back,and I'll draw the accompanying\nregion in the u, v plane,and then we'll see\nhow I set it up.OK, welcome back.Well, the first\nthing I'm going to dois I'm going to draw the\nregion in the u, v plane thatis determined by this region in\nthe x, y plane and the changeof variables.Now, as was mentioned in the\nlecture, all of the changesare linear, and so I'm going\nto be taking lines to lines.So what I'm going to do is\ndetermine at each endpointhere where that endpoint goes\nunder the transformation,and then I will\nconnect the dots.So what do I get?Well, this first one is (0,\n0) for x and y, and so thatcorresponds to x and y\nare 0 here, so u is 0,and x and y are 0 here,\nso it would be a 0,so that's the point (0,\n0) on the u, v plane.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Now, I want to\nmention something hereis that based on how\nthese lines were defined,this is telling you that all\nalong this line 2x minus yequals 0, that means u is equal\nto 0 all along that segment.And if you'll notice also,\n2x plus y is equal to 2here, so v is equal to 2\nall along this segment.So we should expect whatever\nu is, v's going to be 2 here,and whatever v is here,\nu is going to be 0.OK, so I'm going to have\nsomething with u, 0 initially,and then v, 2, I\ncan already expect,it's going to come up here\nand move over that way.But let's just check.So this is the point (0,\n2), 0 for x and 2 for y.Let's see what it is\nin the u, v variables.So u in that case is negative\n2 and v in that case is 2,and so I'm going to\ngo left 2 and up 2.This might not be drawn to\nscale, but this is negative 2,and this is up 2\nhere, and so that'swhere this point goes\nin the transformation.This point is 1/2 comma 1.You can actually\ncheck what it is.But actually, as I\nmentioned, you alreadyknow what has to happen, because\nthis segment is connected righthere, and then we said all\nalong this line, v is 2,and all along this line, u is 0,\nand so that actually carves outthat rectangle.So if you were worried and\nyou weren't able to do itthat way, what you\ncould actually dois say, well, where does\nthe point (1/2, 1) go?If I plug in 1/2\nfor x and 1 for y,I notice that I get u\nequals 0 and v equals 2,and that's this point.And so now, I'm\nlooking at this region.Now, these two things\nare not drawn to scale,because what I want to point\nout is they're both triangles.It's easy to find the area\nbased on how they're sitting", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "in two-dimensional space.So what we see\nhere is if I wantedto find the area\nof this triangle,let's make this the base.The base is 2 and\nthe height is 1/2,so 1/2 of base times height\nis-- that area is equal to 1/2.So the area of R is 1/2, and\nwhat's the area of this one?The area this one is-- well,\nI've got base 2 and height 2,and so it's 1/2 of 2 times 2,\nand so that gives me area as 2.So here the area is\n1/2, here the area is 2,and so notice that\nI've multipliedby 4 to get from here to here.So I can anticipate\nthat I shouldhave-- based on the principle\nyou saw in lecture, Ishould have something\nlike du dv is goingto be equal to 4 times dx dy.That is what I expect to get.Now let's see if when\nwe do the Jacobian,we get the same thing.Let me double check, right?This is area 2, this is area\n1/2, so I have 1/2 times4 is going to give me 2.Yeah, that's what I should get.Oops!That sticks out a little.So now let's just\ncheck our Jacobianand see if that is\nindeed what we get.So I'm going to look at u sub\nx, u sub y, v sub x, v sub y,right?So u sub x is 2, u\nsub y is negative 1,so I get 2, negative 1.v sub x is 2, v sub y\nis 1, so I get 2, 1.2 times 1 is 2, minus negative\n2 gives me, indeed, 4.So I do get, in fact, du\ndv is equal to 4 dx dy.So I know that I'm going to\nhave to-- because I'm changingvariables, though,\nfrom dx dy to du dv,I'm going to divide\nby 4, obviously,when I do the substitution.The substitution will\nbe replacing just dx dy.So I just mention\nthat, but notice:Again, we get what\nwe expect to get.We got a 4 based on the\npicture and we got a 4based on the Jacobian.And so now, we need to\nfinish up the process.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.107}, {"text": "We need to figure out how to\nwrite this in terms of u and vand then figure out our\nbounds in terms of u and v,and then we're done.So let me mention, one\nthing you should noticeis that u times v is\nequal to exactly-- thisis going to be a\ndifference of two squares,and it is precisely 4 x\nsquared minus y squared.If you need to multiply it out\nto check, you can check it,but that's indeed what it is,\nwhich is why this particularsubstitution is quite nice,\nbecause that means thisfunction I'm supposed to be\nintegrating is just u*v raisedto the fourth.So I'm almost done.So let me write in the\npieces I know, and then we'llfill in the last two spots,\nor four spots, which will beall the bounds on the integral.So I'm going to write\nit here, give myselfsome space to write the bounds.So I'm replacing the 4 x squared\nminus y squared by a u*v,so I'm going to get u times\nv, and then the function,that is raised to the fourth\nin the initial problem,so I raise that to the fourth.Then dx dy, as I\nmentioned, will be replacedby a du dv divided by 4.And so I can just put this\nover 4 and write du dv.I should be careful\nwhich order I want to do.It doesn't really matter.I can do either one.du dv, OK?And so now I want to\nknow what u goes fromand to and then what v\nhas to go from and to.So if I come over\nhere, you'll seeit didn't matter,\nbecause I could havepicked either direction to go.But if I'm going\nto go with u, I'mcoming from whatever this\nfunction is over to here,right?And this value here is easy.That's u equals 0.So the top bound for u is 0,\nand the bottom bound for u,this is v is equal to minus\nu, so the bottom bound for uis when u is equal\nto negative v.So I'm running from-- because\nI put the du on the inside,my first one is\nrunning from minus vto-- what did I say-- 0, and\nthen the v-values from therego between 0 and 2.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "You can see this easily\nfrom the picture.So they go between 0 and 2.And I am not going to finish it\noff from here, because it wouldrequire not too much work.It's actually quite\nsimple, because it's justa polynomial and u and\na polynomial and v,but there are a lot\nof powers and therewill be big powers of 2.So suffice it to\nsay, at this point,we can evaluate this\nintegral and it's quite easyto evaluate.And the main point I\nthink we should makeis how did it make it simpler?I mean, the initial problem,\nif we come over here,this is annoying to\nfind an anti-derivative,but not impossible.But the really\nannoying part is Iwould have to take this\nregion and split itinto a bunch of pieces,\nor at least two pieces,to evaluate the integral\nin a reasonable wayor my y-values would go from\nthis line here up to this linehere.It could be complicated.So what we've really done is\nwe've simplified the region.That's the easiest thing.I mean, we also\nsimplified the function,but we've really simplified the\nregion we're integrating over.And so we only have-- one is a\nfunction and one is a constant,and that's quite nice\nto have on the inside.So I think that's\nwhere I'll stop.",
