any of our new lessons.So hang with me because thiswill certainly be the longest tip but it\nwill also be one of the most importantdiscoveries that you have by watching\nthis videoso let's actually start out with a quick\ntest so, first off,So how did you do did you answer,\nmostly a or mostly B?Now if you answered mostly B you most likely are an\nintrovert, but it's not so black and", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.244}, {"text": "white it's not that you're either an\nintrovert or an extrovertand you're on one side or the other it's\nactually more like a scale so you couldbe really completely introverted you\nlike your time alone or you could bereally completely extroverted that you\nneed to be around other people or youcould fall anywhere on that scale\nnow as for me I definitely fall kind oftowards the middle but I definitely am\nan introvert now someone who falls rightin the middle is actually called an\nambivert.Now I'd like you to take a momentand ask yourself \"what is an\nintrovert?\"most people think introverts are loners\nor hermits, nerdy or strange, unfriendlyor antisocial, now normally this is not\nactually the case and you might not evenbe an introvert even though you believe\nyou are one you might actually be a shy extrovert.Now most people think that\nshyness and introversion are synonymsbut this is actually not the case so\nlet's start off with shyness what is shyness?Now shyness is the fear of\nsocial judgment, now shyness is painfulintroversion is not for English learning\nit's probably that fear that you feel ofmaking mistakes of people laughing at\nyou or of failing, it's thatuncomfortableness that you feel because\nyou sound like a child, it's even theshame that you feel about speaking up in\nany sort of situation where you can speak English.Now you certainly should\nnot feel shame for making mistakes it'sreally a natural part of the process but\nthat's a really big topic and we'lldefinitely talk about it in a different\nvideo but what I want you to see hereis that both extroverts and\nintroverts can feel shyness and not allintroverts are necessarily shy, so you\ncould be a shy extrovert or you could bea confident introvert in fact I actually\nhave a friend who I recently was justshocked to find out is actually an\nintrovert because anytime we go to anysocial gathering\nshe is really confident she goes up to", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.103}, {"text": "other people she's curious about them,\nshe asks really great questionsand she seems to just shine in these\nkind of situations.So definitely by thisdescription it sounds like my friend is\nan extrovert, right?Well it's actually not the case and\nwe'll see why in just a few moments butfor now what I want you to see is that\nif you are an introvert it does not meanthat you cannot overcome your shyness\nand be confident and I want the rest ofthe tips in this video to help you to\nreach your really confident self whilestill proudly being an introvert so if\nintroversion is not shyness then whatexactly is it?Now being an extrovert or\nan introvert actually has to do with howyour brain reacts to stimulation.Now extroverts really crave stimulation they're \ndrawn to it that's why they thrive insituations like parties meetings or\nconferences now you probably know someextroverts who have really struggled\nduring this time of confinement duringthe pandemic, now introverts on the other\nhand are much more sensitive to thestimulation and that's why in these same\nkinds of situations of being at a partya conference or even a creative\nbrainstorm they feel overstimulated andtheir energy is quickly drained they\nneed to recharge with quiet, reflectionand alone time now this is why\nintroverts are usually much more drawnto activities like reading, watching TV\nseries, playing video games or evenone-on-one conversations but about a\ndeeper topic now if you identify withthis then think about when you're with\nfamily or close friendsyou probably don't usually kind of feel\noverwhelmed and you probably also don'treally feel shyness, but you still will\nneed that time away on your own torecharge your batteries now to find out\nif you are shy or an introvert thinkabout how you would react to \nan invitation to a social event.Now a person who was shy maybe even if they were an\nextrovert would probably say no to theinvitation because they actually feel\nanxiety or fear but an introvert would", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.12}, {"text": "say no because they would prefer just to\nstay in and be on their own.Now this of course also means that you can be a \nnon shy introvert like Bill Gates or Meryl StreepNow while they definitely value\ntheir time alone to recharge there areauthentic people and they don't really\ncare what others think about them.Now of course you could also be a shy introvert\nand it's not unlikely in factmany introverts are shy because when they\nwere younger they received some sort ofnegative feedback telling them that it\nwas wrong that they preferred beingalone or reflecting or it could just be\nlack of experience because introvertsnaturally avoid stimulating situations.Now if you are a shy introvert it mightbe soothing to you to recognize that\nextroverts can also be shy it isn't easyfor every extrovert to be on a stage or\nto be in a really social environment infact we recently did a lesson teaching\nEnglish with Shakira and throughwatching a lot of interviews with her I\ndiscovered that she's actually reallyshy but I would be willing to bet that\nshe is definitely an extrovert becauseshe has a tremendous presence when she's\non stage so she actually used what shewas passionate about to overcome her\nshyness and we'll talk about that more later in the video.All right so that's\nall for this first tip we'll be goingthrough the next ten much faster but as\nwe do I want you to start reflectingalready on whether you are introverted,\nshy or both so let's get into the nextone so the next tip is to actually start\nspeaking online through Whatsapp oranother similar chatting tool.This will help you to connect \nthrough someonethrough the protective barrier of a\nscreen and then once you get to knowthis person better you can actually\nconnect face to face via Skype andpractice your speaking now you might\nfeel nervous and this is completelynormal but the more that you practice\nthe easier that it will get and anotherthing that you should know about\nintroverts is that normally we don'tlike small talk now small talk is kind\nof those little conversations that youhave to try to get to know someone or to\nstart a conversation like about the", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.197}, {"text": "weather or what someone does for\njob but when you start speaking withsomeone via Whatsapp you've gotten all\nthose small talk conversations out ofthe way so that you can talk about a\nmore deep topic that you'll find morefulfilling as an introvert now a really\nfantastic way for you to startpracticing your English in this way is\nthrough our Fluency Circle community nowthis is filled with our students from\nall over the world who are passionateabout

highlyrecommend that you try to create a\nstrong relationship with someone inEnglish now a great way to do this can\nbe to get a teacher, a coach, a tutor ora language partner now the first reason\nthat this is really great is because youget to know them and they get to know\nyou there's not as much pressure becauseit's one-on-one and you know when the\nconversations going to end because it'susually just one hour or so.Now if you get a teacher or a coach, \na good one anywaythey will have a lot of\nexperience and they will help you togrow your confidence without judging you\nor another great option is to practiceEnglish with other learners like I\nmentioned we do this in the Fluency Circleand this is really awesome\nbecause they have empathy for you they", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.491}, {"text": "know exactly what you're going through.So one of our strengths is an introvertis making and sticking to a plan so use\nthat strength I highly recommend thatyou start out by forcing yourself to do\nsomething where you'll have to speakEnglish now this could be\nto an English event or a languageexchange this could be talking with\nsomeone in English from your work thatyou know is from another country or it\ncould even just be going up to a touriston the street and starting a\nconversation.Now for me personally I \nlove going to language exchangesI find that this is a great \nway to build my confidenceand to reach my goal of\nspeaking other languages.Now maybe for you this sounds scary but I think that\nif you actually do it you're going toend up having a really good time and\njust imagine the fulfillment that youwill feel when you actually challenge\nyourself to do something like thisso just to give you another example I\nactually traveled to Paris last year andeven though I have pretty basic French I\nwanted to take advantage of thisopportunity to increase my skills so I\nchallenged myself that anywhere I went Iwould speak French before asking the\nperson if they spoke English sobasically any time I went to a cafe a\nrestaurant if I asked directions on thestreet at the museum or anywhere else I\nwould always start in French andactually I did learn a lot during just a\nfew days that I was travelling there sothis is actually a really great example\nof a small win that I was giving myselfnow this is just doing something small\nthat will help to boost your confidence,so for example, you could go up to a\ntourist on the street and speak to them inEnglish if they seem like they're lost\nyou could go into a Starbucks where youknow that they'll speak English and\norder your coffee in English it's justfinding these little opportunities to\nactually start using the language andkind of breaking out of your shyness so\nwhat I recommend that you do for this isthat you actually make an agreement with\nyourself you could actually write thisdown to make it a little bit more\nofficial but I know that you're hereyou're watching this video because you\nhave the goal to learn English and we'regoing to talk more about this in a\nlittle bit but basically one thing that", "start": 600.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "you could do just to give you an example\nis that you could agree with yourselfthat one time a week you're going to go to\nsome event where you can speak Englishand basically your goal during that time\nis to have one conversation with justone person to get that person's contact\nand then to continue the conversationlater so that you can continue\npracticing your English and then if youdo that that really pretty small thing\nthen you can go home and you don't haveto feel guilty about\nno to any other opportunities that weekalso as a part of your plan I recommend\nactually having a time that you're goingto leave that way you can go home and\nrecharge yourself but you definitelyneed to make the most of the time that\nyou have there so the rest of the tipsare also going to help you a lot with\ndeveloping this plan so let's continue.Now another one of your strengths is\nintrovert is that you are probably agreat listener, introverts tend to be\nmore focused than extroverts so put thisto use put the focus on the other person\nbe curious be a great listener ask smartquestions and people love talking about\nthemselves and this is a really greatway to get people to like you.Now I know everyone wants \nto improve their speakingbut you definitely need to recognize\ninput versus output now input is whatgoes in basically reading and listening\noutput is what goes out so that'swriting and speaking now actually in\norder to improve your speaking input issuper important you need to do much more\nof input so listening is reallyimportant to develop your skills as a\nspeaker.So as I mentioned earlier extroverts \ntend to like small talklike talking about the weather sports orother similar topics but introverts tend\nto prefer deeper topics and this isactually why you might be at like a\ndinner party or something and see anintrovert who's really quiet and you\nmight think well that person's reallyshy but it's not actually about shyness\nthey're probably just thinking thistopic just doesn't really interest me so\nI'm not gonna say anything so as part ofyour plan to speak more and to overcome\nyour shyness one thing that you canactually do is write down at home things\nthat you're really interested in talking", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.927}, {"text": "about and then you can actually practice\nby yourself speaking about these you caneven record yourself and listen back to\ngive yourself feedback or another thingthat you could do is tell that other\nperson about something that you recentlylearned now doing things like this are\ngoing to not only increase yourconfidence but they'll actually probably\nget you really excited to talk about thetopics that you're actually \ninterested in.So as an introvert I know you'regoing to want to avoid making mistakes\nbut remind yourself that for that shortamount of time that you're having a\nconversation with another person thatthe mistakes are great you need to make\na lot of them andact in order to improve so don't let\nthem get you embarrassed make a mentalnote to learn from them later but stay\npresent while you're in thatconversation\nand speaking of embarrassment it'sreally important that you start seeing\nit as something positive all that itmeans is that you care what other people\nthink of you and studies have shown thatpeople tend to see other people's\nembarrassment as an indicator of thatperson's genuineness and authenticity so,\ntake a deep breath remind yourself ofthis fact and even start to get used to\nlaughing it yourself if you make a sillymistake you don't have to take it\npersonally.All right so the next tip isto actually connect your English to\nanother passion of yours, so before wetalked about going to language learning\nevents or English speaking events butthis is not the only way to practice\nyour English another really great way tomeet people is by actually finding ways\nthat connect to things you're passionateabout so for example say that you love\ntennis what you could do is find somedifferent tennis forms online and\nconnect with people there who share yourpassion and then talk to them about this\ninterest you could even connect withthem via Skype maybe you can even\nconnect to people in your city to giveyou an example with myself right now I'm\nactually taking vocal coaching and onething that has been really great is that\nnot only am i learning about somethingnew but I'm actually learning vocabulary\nin Spanish related to that thing that", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.592}, {"text": "I'm interested in and actually improving\nmy vocabulary in the language I'm learning.So this also gives you a whole\nnew purpose for learning English I couldgive you another example from one of our\nteam members Agnieszka who is also anintrovert and she also used to be quite\nshy but she has really blossomed andshe's used her english to do it she\nactually joined Toastmasters which wassomething that she wanted to become a\nbetter public speaker and so she's hadto actually give speeches in front of\nother people in her native languagepolish but also in English and this has\nbeen a whole new way for her to tie herpassion of learning English to another\npassion of hers and to really developherself as a person and Agnieszka has\nalso told me that this has really helpedher to overcome her shyness so this is a\nreally great way for you to be less shyas well but also just to get really\nexcited about yourbecause you're tying it to something\nelse that you're passionate about.Okay so if you are an introvert you can never\nbe an extrovert and do not believeanyone who tells you otherwise just like\nyour height its genetic and it'ssomething that you cannot change but you\ncan fake it you can stretch yourself andact like an extrovert when it's\nimportant but just like a rubber bandthere's a limit to how much it can\nstretch and if you stretch it too muchit'll break and it'll be very disastrous\nso make sure when you do this that youget plenty of time to rest and recharge.However this goes back to the last pointif you are faking it it must be for a\nworthy cause so for you as an Englishlearner it must be really closely\naligned with a deeper purpose for whyyou are learning the language don't fake\nit because you think that there'ssomething wrong with you and you need to\nconform to how other people think youshould be the roads of success is not in\ntrying to be someone that you're not itis in discovering what makes you unique\nand what you can personally contributehowever if you're faking it because it's\nnecessary for a cause that's reallyimportant to you then you can be\nsuccessful to a point for example Elon Muskhates public speaking but he does\nit because he feels a really deep", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.406}, {"text": "purpose to change the world and it's a\nnecessary part of achieving that goal oranother example would be Meryl Streep\nthat we talked about earlier she saysthat she uses visualization exercises to\nactually put herself into the situationand obviously it works for her because\nit's really convincing in many of hermovies that she's not an introvert so\nwhat is your purposeI recommend actually writing about it,\njournaling about it and really gettingto know yourself and that way when you\nreally do need to act like an extrovertthen you'll shine in that presentation\nor meeting or whatever is reallynecessary for you to do the things that\nare important to you.So finally number eleven,it's really valiant what you're\ndoing you're putting yourself outside ofyour comfort zone doing things that are\nreally difficult for you for somethingthat's really important for you so\nreally it's important that you giveyourself some sort of reward for this\neffort so after doing something draininglike going to an event, a meeting, a\nlanguage exchange or a party dosomething that is really fulfilling for\nyou as an introvert like reading a bookfor me personally I really enjoy getting\ntogether withmy friends on the weekend but I also\nfind it that it can be really tiring ifI overdo it like if I try to make plans\nwith friends for Friday, Saturday andSunday by the end I'm just gonna be\nexhausted and that's going to affect mywork during the week so being that I\nactually know this about myself I takethis into account when I'm planning my\nweekends I get together with one groupof friends at most just Saturday night\nor just Sunday during the day but Idon't do it more than one day because I\nknow if I do then it's not going to bebeneficial for me it's going to have the\nopposite effect but by doing this I'mactually getting out there I'm seeing\nthe people that I care about and then Ireward myself by doing something that I\nwould prefer to do at home on Sunday.All right guys thanks so much for joining\nme today now a lot of today's lesson hasbeen based on a fantastic book called\nQuiet by Susan Cain now if you are
