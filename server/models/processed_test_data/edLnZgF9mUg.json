[{"text": "TINA SRIVASTAVA: All right.So as we discussed,\nwe're going to start offwith the most basic question--\nhow do airplanes fly?It's a very critical question.I think everybody should\nknow the answer to this.Going back to the\ncomic that Minachihad with Calvin and Hobbes, and\nnot knowing how airplanes fly,and thinking that it's\nmagic is not the waythat any MIT student should be.So we're going to cover\nhow airplanes fly.And we're actually\ngoing to go beyond whatthe FAA requires you to know.Because frankly, you should\nknow how airplanes fly.So just so that we have a\ncommon vocabulary with whichto discuss, we're going\nto talk a little bitabout airplane parts.So here in my little\nairplane, it's kind of a modelthere so you can see that at the\nfront you have your propeller.And so the engine and the\npropeller in this little planeis up here at the front.Who knows what a fuselage is?Just shout it out.AUDIENCE: The middle part.TINA SRIVASTAVA:\nThe middle part.The body.It's where the passengers sit.Yeah, so that whole middle\npart where people sit.So if you're thinking\nabout a big jet engine,it's where all the rows of\nseats are where everybody sits.That tube in the middle\nis called the fuselage.And the wings stick\nout the sides.So the middle part\nis the fuselage.And then one thing\nthat's interestingis the tail actually has\na lot more components.People kind of casually\nrefer to it as the tail.But there's a vertical\npart that comes upin the back of the\nvertical part of the tailcan actually tilt side to side.And then you have a\nflat horizontal part.And that actually has a back\npart that can go down and up.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.632}, {"text": "And so we're going to talk\nabout what all of these are.So the back vertical part\nwhen it goes side to sideis your rudder.The flat part is your elevator\nthat you can move up and down,allows you to\ncontrol the airplane.We also have, of\ncourse, the wings.Sometimes, there are struts\nthat support the wings.So they go from the wing\ndown to that fuselage.And then you have landing gear.In this case, you have these\nwheels down at the bottom.We're also going to talk to you\nduring this course about seaplanes.So they have slightly\ndifferent landing gear.But this is a good\nplace to start.The other thing that\nwe need to talk aboutare just the main four forces\nthat are on an airplane.So they're pretty\nstraightforward.So the force going up is lift.And that force is opposed by\nthe downward force of weight.And then when you're moving\nthe airplane forward,that's thrust.And it is opposed by drag.So what we're\ngoing to talk aboutis that in order for\nan airplane to go up,the lift has to exceed the drag.In order for the\nairplane to go forward,the thrust has to exceed the--excuse me.The lift has to\nexceed the weight.And the thrust has\nto exceed the drag.So those are the\nmain four forceswe're going to be\nworking with today.So now I'm going to spend\na little bit of timeover here on the blackboard.AUDIENCE: Hey video folks, is it\neasier to use that blackboard?TINA SRIVASTAVA: They\nsaid this blackboard.AUDIENCE: This one's better?TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah.AUDIENCE: These are\nall chalks of color.TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah,\nfancy-colored chalk.All right.AUDIENCE: Chalks of color.TINA SRIVASTAVA:\nChalks of color.All right.So I will preface the discussion\nabout lift with the fact", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.394}, {"text": "that there are a lot of\ntheories of lift out there,some of which are wrong.So if you spent some\ntime googling liftbefore coming here, you\nmight have actually founda couple scenarios that\nare completely false.So we're going to\nfocus on what's true,but I will cover least one\nof those false theoriesto make sure you guys\ndon't get hung up on that.So in order to talk\nabout it, we'regoing to think\nabout an airplane.And we're going to do a\ncross-section of the airplane.So if you took a saw,\nand you cut off the wing,what are you left with?And I'll do it this way.So if you cut off the wing,\nat the front of the wingis the leading edge.The back of the wing\nis the trailing edge.If you did it-- if you cut that\noff, what does it look like?So it looks like this.And this shape is\ncalled an airfoil.And we'll get into\nthe specifics later.But first we'll just--we'll talk about a simple way\nto understand how lift works.So if this is the wing,\nand you have air coming in,the air is pushed down by\nthe shape of this wing.So that means is as air flows\nby, it gets pushed down.Now what is air?Air is not nothing.Air has molecules.It has mass.So if you think about\nconservation of momentum,this is I think the easiest\nway to think about lift.So conservation of momentum, you\nhave a bunch of air molecules.And those air molecules\nare pushed down.So you have mass\nbeing pushed down.So if mass is being pushed down\nfor conservation of momentum,something must be pushed up.And that's the wing.So that's the easiest\nway to think about itthat if you're deflecting the\nair downward in order to have", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.16}, {"text": "conservation of momentum,\nthe mass of the wingis lifted upwards.We're going to break\nthat down, but I thinkthat's a good place to start.I'm just going to take\none moment to talkabout an incorrect\ntheory of lift.So let me emphasize it's wrong.One of them is called\nequal transit theory.Has anyone heard about this?Getting a lot of head nods.It's wrong.Equal transit theory,\nwhich is incorrect,says that basically a molecule\nof air that's coming overthat starts over\nhere at the fronthas to go around the bottom and\nmeet the tail at the same timethat a molecule that\ngoes over the tophas to meet it at the back.There is no physical\nprinciple that says that.It is false.And in fact, we have\nmeasured that they don't.The molecules that\ngo under the bottomof the wing versus\nthe top of the wingdon't actually reach the\nend at the same time.But in this false theory,\nequal transit theory,they say that you have to reach\nthe bottom at the same time.They also say that there\nis more distance basicallyto cover because of the\nshape of the airfoil.So in order for the\nmolecules going overthe top to reach\nat the same timeas the molecules over the\nbottom, they have to go faster.And so since the\nair is moving fasterover the top and the bottom,\nthat's what creates lift.So that's false.And there are many\nreasons why it's false,the biggest one being that there\nis no physical principle thatsays that two molecules starting\nat the same time, one goingover the top and one\ngoing over the bottom,reaches the end\nat the same time.That's just not true.And we'll show you some more\ndiagrams that show in factit doesn't happen,\nthat molecules don't", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.153}, {"text": "reach at the same time anyway.So please despite that being\nvery widely propagated,that is not true.And please don't spend\ntime on that theory.So let's focus on what is\ntrue, how does it really work.Actually, let me give you one\nmore reason why that's false.The real reason that\nequal transit theoryis trying to tell you\nthat that generates liftis that because of the shape\nof the airfoil, the shapeof the wing, that's why the\ndistance that it has to travelis different over the\ntop versus the bottom.But one reason that's\nwrong-- can you pass methat paper airplane please?Who has built a paper\nairplane before?I see at least two people\nwho didn't raise their hand.Do we need to do\na class exercise?If you have not built\na paper airplane,it's really important that you\ndo just as a general childhoodexperience.Here's a paper airplane.Thank you, Minachi,\nfor building it for me.If we took this paper airplane\ninstead of this fancy airplane,and we did a cross-section\nof this wing,what would it look like?Yes.You demonstrated with your\nhands, but shout it out.AUDIENCE: It's going to be the\nsame at the top and the bottom.It's just a piece of paper.TINA SRIVASTAVA:\nYeah, it's goingto be the same at the\ntop and the bottom.It's just a piece of paper.Exactly.It's just like a\nlittle flat rectangle.So instead of this fancy\nshape that you have here--we're going to use\nred for wrong--it's like a little rectangle.That's what a paper airplane's\ncross-section of its winglooks like.Well, surprise.Surprise.As you said, it's the same\nat the top and the bottom.So the distance\nthat a air moleculewould have to travel over\nthe top and the bottomis identical.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.346}, {"text": "So really, the equal transit\ntheory completely falls apart.Yet, a paper\nairplane still flies.So why is that the case?Again, remember\nthe actual reasonis that if this paper\nairplane is inclined,it is pushing air down.So air that's coming\nup is bumping into itand being pushed down.And therefore, as you\ndeflect air molecules down,conservation of momentum--\nthe wing is lifted up.So now we're going to break\nthis down in a little bit moredetail.And I'm going to go back\nover here to the slides.So one thing that's\nimportant, as I said,a really detailed\nmathematical descriptionis not really necessary to\nfly a plane or become a pilot.The FAA doesn't require\nsome of this detail.But it is important to\nknow it to the extentthat it helps you control\nthe airplane and fly it.So here's a good reference\nin terms of that.But one of the biggest things\nis just that for lift, youhave to increase that\ndownward momentum of the air.And airfoils are--\nthe shape whichis called an airfoil\nis a type of shape thatis very efficient at increasing\nthat downward momentum.Now, who knows what\nBernoulli's principle is?Who's heard of Bernoulli?Good.Everyone's heard of Bernoulli.Can anyone articulate\nBernoulli's principle?Yes.AUDIENCE: I think it's like\np plus one half of mv squaredequals constant the\ndifference squared.So when the pressure\ngoes down somewhere,the speed of the\nparticle has to go up.TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yes.Absolutely.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.169}, {"text": "Absolutely.So what Bernoulli\nobserved was the casethat when there is a\ndecrease in pressure,there's an increase in velocity.That's the core concept\nthat you have to understand.And so when we think about an\nairfoil, when we see that--and I'll draw another\nairfoil for us to talk about.When we have air\nthat's moving veryfast over the top\nof the wing, thatmeans an increase\nin velocity meansthere's a decrease in pressure.So this is the extent\nto which you really needto know it for the FAA exam.So which statement relates\nto Bernoulli's principle?I'll let you read those answers.So is it A, B, or C?Shout it out.AUDIENCE: C.TINA SRIVASTAVA: C. Good job.Well done.We're going to discuss a\nlittle bit more details though.In order for any wing\nto generate lift,it has to be in a fluid.If this airplane was in\nspace or in a vacuum,and there wasn't any\nfluid passing by it,then there wouldn't be any\nmolecules to deflect downward.And therefore, you\ncouldn't push the wing up.But the fluid doesn't\nalways have to be air.You might see similar\ndesigns underwaterfor underwater drones.It just has to be a fluid\nthat's passing by the object.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.309}, {"text": "So when you have this airfoil in\na fluid, when the fluid is notmoving, when it's stationary,\nthen all of the fluidis exerting pressure\non the airfoil.So you get all these\nlittle normal forcesexerting pressure.When the fluid is not\nmoving, and the airfoilis stationary in the fluid,\nthen all of those pressureforces, all those normal\nforces or forces perpendicular,sum to zero because\nthere's no net force.It's just sitting in the fluid.But when that fluid is\nmoving, it generates a force.So that's the force it\ngenerates generally whenthe fluid is moving forward.And a force is a vector.So it has direction\nas well as magnitude.So there is a vertical component\nand a horizontal componentto that.So we call the vertical\ncomponent the lift.Does anyone know what we call\nthe horizontal component?AUDIENCE: Drag.TINA SRIVASTAVA: Drag.Good job.Now, here's a dumb question.What part of the\naircraft generates lift?Yes.AUDIENCE: The whole aircraft.TINA SRIVASTAVA:\nThe whole aircraft.Good job.So a lot of people might\nbe under the misimpressionthat it's only the wings\nthat are generating the lift.Well, actually, the whole\naircraft is generating lift.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.37}, {"text": "And it's not just aircraft.Any objects that are\nmoving through fluidhave this phenomenon.And sometimes, it's\nnot a good thing.So what is this a picture of?A race car.Come on, guys.I know we're in an\nairplane class but--who can tell me what is\nthat thing sticking upat the back of the race car?AUDIENCE: A spoiler.TINA SRIVASTAVA: A spoiler.What's a spoiler?AUDIENCE: It spoils the airflow.TINA SRIVASTAVA: It\nspoils the airflow.So when a race car is\ndriving on a race track,and it's going through the\nair-- the fluid is air--actually just the race car\nitself is generating lift.And that lift can cause the\nrace car to kind of liftupward and not be as much\nin traction with the ground.And when you're a race car, and\nyou want to go really, reallyfast, you want to have\nvery good tractionwith your wheels\nagainst the groundso you can go as\nfast as you can.So the reason that you\nhave a spoiler at the backis actually to counteract the\nlift that's being generatedby the race car.So it's not just airplanes\nand wings that generate lift,but really anything\nmoving through a fluidcan generate lift.So we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about equations.Don't get scared here.We'll just dive into\nit step by step.So we have f equals ma.Hopefully, this is\nnot the first timeyou're hearing\nabout that equation.So can somebody just shout\nout what is acceleration?AUDIENCE: Change in velocity\nwith respect to time.TINA SRIVASTAVA: Change\nin velocity over time.Very good.So velocity again\nis also a vector.So velocity being a vector has\nboth a magnitude and direction.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.531}, {"text": "So you can change\nthe velocity eitherby changing the magnitude\nor the direction.In the case of an\nairfoil, we're changingthe direction of the air.So the air has velocity.It's coming in.We're changing the\ndirection of that air.And that's generating the lift.So because we changed the\ndirection of the velocity,that creates a force.That's our force f.So f is actually\nhere representingthe rate of change of\nmomentum of pushing those airmolecules down and\ngenerating a force,creating the airfoil\nto be lifted up.So that's why we discussed\nagain that equal transittheory is false.Because even an paper airplane\nwith a completely flatcross-section of\nits wing, as longas it's inclined upward\nsuch that the air isbeing pushed down will fly.So here's another question.Which moves faster--\nthe wing through the airor the air past the wing?Wow, you're very quiet.Which moves faster?Yes.AUDIENCE: The air over the wing.TINA SRIVASTAVA: The\nair over the wing.We have one for the air over\nthe wing is moving fasterthan the wing through the air.Anyone else?Yes.AUDIENCE: Depends on where on\nthe wing you're talking about.TINA SRIVASTAVA: Depends\non where on the wingyou're talking about.Yes.AUDIENCE: Because\nif you define airto be the air that's\nimmediately next to the--that is in contact with\nthe wing or the general airas in the air space.TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yes.AUDIENCE: If it's the air\nthat's in contact with the wing,they're going at the same speed.TINA SRIVASTAVA: So it\ndepends on which airyou're talking about.True.Actually, what we're discussing\nis about frame of reference.So depending on your\nframe of reference,if your frame of\nreference is the airfoil,", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.383}, {"text": "you can take it to be that\nthe airfoil is stationary.And you see the wing to\nbe stationary and the airto be moving past you.If your frame of\nreference is out here,you might see the air to be\nstationary and the airplaneto be moving through it.So depending on what your\nframe of reference is,you can actually have\nthe identical result.So the answer is actually\nthat it's the same.So depending on your\nframe of reference,it's exactly the same the\nspeed of the air movingpast the airfoil versus the\nairfoil moving through the air.And the reason-- so does anyone\nwant to dive more into that?Are you guys familiar with this\nconcept of frame of reference?Yes.A lot of head nodding.Great.So the reason that's significant\nis that as we learn about liftand as we study\nthis, we actuallycould create a whole bunch\nof different airfoils,and then build airplanes, and\nthen fly them through the air,and measure them.But that's very expensive.So instead, what we do is we\nbasically take the airfoil.And we put it on a\nstick, and then weput it inside a wind tunnel.Has anyone been\nin a wind tunnel?Got a couple people.Hey, we saw that like over 60\nof you guys were aero-astro.You need to go to your\nWright brothers wind tunnel.It's being upgraded\nactually right nowover in your building 33.So because it's\nexactly identical,the air moving past the\nairfoil or the airfoilmoving through the\nair, it's a lot cheaperto put the airfoil on a\nstick in a wind tunnel,and then shoot air past it,\nand then do your measurementsrather than continuing to take\noff airplanes and fly themthrough the air.So we're going to be talking\nabout that a little bit.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.224}, {"text": "So the question is, what\nfactors affect lift?So there are a lot of\nthings that affect lift.So one has to do with\nthe object itself.So I was talking about\nthe shape of the airfoil.So we talked about\na different shape,which is just a\nflat piece of paperor a rectangle as a shape.You can have a\nmore slender shape.And the way that\nyou modify the shapecan significantly\nimpact your lift.So for example, one\nof the modificationscan be back here at the end.If you made your\nairfoil longer like thisand point even\nfarther down, then itwould push the air in a\nslightly different way.So that would affect the\nlift that that airfoilcould generate.It would also affect the\ndrag that it induces.Another aspect is just\nthe size of the wingand the shape of the wing.So we see a lot of\ndifferent kinds.So this is a big\nrectangular wing.In a jet, you might\nsee a swept wing.There are different\ntypes of shapes.And then there's\nalso just the area.So regardless of whether--if this is your--if you're looking\ndown at an airplane--so this is kind of\nthe broad, flat wings,or you could have very\nthin, skinny wingsthat you might see on a glider.Regardless, there is a\nsurface area of the wing.That area also impacts\nthe lift quite a bit.And the aspect ratio as we\njust discussed in the shapecan affect lift.The other thing other\nthan the object itself,other than the\nwing itself, motioncan affect lift, so the\nvelocity of the air.And the very\nimportantly is what'scalled the angle of attack.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So it's the angle with which\nthis airfoil has to the air.So if you had one airfoil\nthat was pointed uplike this versus one, the same\none but it was not tilted up,this airfoil would be having a\nhigher angle of attack or angleto the wind than this one.Now, this might seem like\na very fancy description,but who has been in a car\ndriving down the highway,and you stuck your\nhand out outside?And if you tilt your\nhand up a little bit,you'll see that the wind\nkind of pushes your hand up.And if you tilt it down,\nyour hand pushes up.And you kind of glide\nyour hand out the window.So I'm getting a\nlot of head nods.So that's really all\nthat angle of attackis talking about that if\nyou angle your hand up,it gets pushed up a lot more.If you angle it down,\nit gets pushed down.That's the angle of attack.And we're going to define\nit more specifically whenwe talk about the\nterms associatedwith an airfoil in\nthe shape, but it'sgood to get the\ngeneral concept first.And then another\nfactor affecting liftis the air, the fluid\nthat it's in, sothe actual mass of the\nairflow coming around you.So there are a lot\nof aspects to that.We talked about whether\nyou're in water,whether you're in air, or\nthe density of the air.Another component of that\nair is the viscosity.Does anyone know\nwhat viscosity is?Yes.AUDIENCE: Resistance to flow.TINA SRIVASTAVA:\nResistance to flow.The way I like to\nthink about it isif you've ever baked brownies,\nand you have your mixing bowland your spatula in\nthere, and if you justhave the water and\nthe oil and eggs,and you're mixing it around,\nyou can mix pretty quickly.And it doesn't stick to\nthe spatula that much.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.12}, {"text": "But if you were mixing\nmolasses or once youget all that brownie batter in\nthere, it's harder to do it.And it sticks to the spatula.So that's what we're\ntalking about whenwe're talking about viscosity.So it's the tendency\nfor these moleculesto stick to each other and\nto stick to the object that'smoving through them.So with the case of the\nairfoil, we're talking about--and we were discussing this\njust a moment ago about whichair were we talking about.So some air that\nmight be very closemight kind of stick\nto that airfoilor stick to the wing versus\njust moving smoothly past it.So viscosity has a big impact.And then compressibility\nalso affects lift.So the compressibility\nof the air--did I turn off my mic?So certain types of\nfluids are compressible.So you could take\na balloon of air.And you can move it\ninto a cold environmentand have it shrink or\nin a hot environmentand have it expand while\nhaving the same amount of massinside the balloon.So I'm getting a\nlot of head nods.So that just shows the\ncompressibility of the air,whereas some types of\nfluids are not compressible.They're incompressible.And they affect lift\nin a different way.So although I've told\nyou all these thingsthat affects lift, one\nthing I will admit to you isthat calculating lift is\ndifficult. It's very difficult.In fact, we don't really\nknow how to do it properly.This is a snapshot\nfrom Wikipediaof all the different\ntheories of lift.So there are a lot\nof different waysthat people go about\ntrying to calculate lift.And it turns out that\nit's very hard to do.So one that you see up\nthere is Navier-Stokes.So Navier-Stokes is\na set of equationsthat does a really good\njob of predicting lift.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.107}, {"text": "And it really takes into\naccount a lot of things.It takes into account\nconservation of energy,conservation of mass,\nconservation of momentum,viscosity, even a lot of things\nlike thermal conductivityand a whole bunch\nof considerations.But the problem is that solving\nthose equations is very hard.We try to use supercomputers to\nestimate every little aspect.And it's very difficult to do.And we're not\nreally able to solvethose equations to determine\nprecisely what the lift isgoing to be.Let me talk about some\nof the limitationsthat we have in solving\nthese equations.So first of all, it\nhas to do with howthe air flows over the wing.If the air is moving very\nsmoothly past the airfoil,then it's very easy to come up--not easy, but it's\neasier to approximate.We can predict what a particular\nair molecule is going to do.But as you see there, when\nit starts spinning aroundand becoming turbulent--so if you start seeing a\nparticular air molecule that'smoving around, and becoming\nturbulent, so not doinglaminar flow but turbulent,\nand moving around, and bumpinginto other air molecules,\nthen predictingwhat that molecule does and\nwhat all the molecules do aroundit become very, very\ndifficult. In fact,we have a very hard\ntime doing that.And so instead, we\nbasically assumethat that doesn't happen.And we impose some\nlimitations or conditionson the airflow which\nare not actually truebut help us with\napproximating lift.So one of those is\nthe Kutta conditionthat you see at the bottom left,\nwhich is this smooth flow off.So basically, you say that\nnone of this turbulenceis happening.And the air moves\nvery cleanly off.", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.214}, {"text": "And you also have a couple\nother specific requirementssuch as that no air\nmolecule from the topcomes over to the bottom, and\nno air molecule from the bottomgoes around to the top.And you just assume that\nthey move smoothly off.And so that Kutta\ncondition is actuallyvery helpful in\napproximating lift.We also make other assumptions\nthat there's no viscosityor that the fluid\nis not compressible.Sometimes, these\nassumptions are appropriate.And sometimes, they're not.Another thing that's really\ncritical about our abilityto estimate lift is that as\nI've been talking to you hereon the blackboard, I have\ntalked about a cross-section,that you just--you cut off the wing.And you're only looking\nat one cross-section.So since we're talking\nabout a cross-section,we're talking in\ntwo-dimensional space.Well, we can actually\ndo a pretty good jobof estimating lift in a\ntwo-dimensional environment.But the fact of the matter is\nwings are not two dimensional.And the wing comes\nout into the classroomand back into the blackboard.And to estimate actually\nhow all these air flowswork at the edge of the\nwing is very difficult.Has anyone heard\nabout tip vortices?Couple head nods.So we have a picture\nthere that shows a jetto just show a\nlittle bit about whatthe air does when it comes off\nthe edge, the end of the wing.We're going to talk about\ntip vortices a little bit.But the problem is that\nit no longer is adheringto all of our conditions.Now, we don't have smooth flow.We definitely have\nturbulent flow.We have spinning flow.And we have air molecules\nhitting other air molecules.And it becomes extremely\ndifficult for usto model all of\nthose air molecules.We really can't do it.So going from two dimensions\nto three dimensionsis really a limitation\nof a lot of the equations", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.424}, {"text": "that we have to\napproximate lift.So what do we do?Well, first of all, we go back\nto our two-dimensional surface.And we talked about all\nof these normal forces,so when you have all\nthe fluid going past,and it has pressure,\nand it's supplyingall these forces perpendicular\nto the airfoil all around.So how do you approximate lift?Well, you say, oh, that's fine.You just sum all\nthose forces around.Well, that's great if you know\nwhat all of those forces are,but it's not great if you don't\nknow what all of them are.So what is the\nsolution that we--what we do?Basically, we\ncalculate what we can,and then we measure the\nrest experimentally.So in this equation of lift,\nfor example, so we haveL is for lift.Some of the other terms\nthat you have there--rho is the one that\nlooks like a p.So rho is talking\nabout the air density.You have velocity.And A is the wing\narea we talked about.And then we have this fancy\nlittle symbol there C subL or the coefficient of lift.And basically, we\nsay that I don'tknow how to come up\nwith characterizingall those complications\nabout viscosityand some of the effects like\nthat have to do with turbulenceand shock waves, Mach\nnumber, Reynolds number, allthese types of things.And so we say we'll\nmeasure what we can,and then we'll-- or we'll\ncalculate what we can,and then we'll actually, in a\nwind tunnel where we put thisguy on a stick, we'll actually\nmeasure the coefficientof lift.And that's how we\nreally calculate liftthese days is using\na lot of measurementto inform what's actually\nhappening because it's justvery complicated.AUDIENCE: Tina, that\nvelocity is squared, right?", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.87}, {"text": "So if you go twice as fast, you\nget four times as much lift.TINA SRIVASTAVA: That\nis the relationship.Absolutely.And the other thing\nthat's really importantis that that coefficient\nof lift is measuredfor a given angle of attack.So we talked a little\nbit about angle of attackwith your hand\noutside the window.So let's get into defining it\na little bit more in detail.So in order to describe it,\nI have to come up with a fewmore terms that have\nto do with the airfoil.So we talked about\nthe very frontof the airfoil or\nthe front of the wingis called the leading\nedge, and then the backis the trailing edge.And we talked about the\ntrailing edge a little bitwhen we were talking\nabout the Kutta conditionthat no air molecule-- we're\nassuming no air moleculecan cross the trailing\nedge to the other side.So then the camber is in there.So that's just talking\nabout really representingthe curvature of

to sleep.Giving up?TINA SRIVASTAVA: I'll\njust point at it.So this is the chord\nline of the wing.So you can see that\nthis is a full airplane.The airfoil is right here.And you see this chord\nline going from the backto the front.Is somebody trying to\ncome in the door there?Great.And then we'll talk about\nsome of these terms.Basically, the most important\nthing to think about", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.683}, {"text": "is the angle of attack.Thank you for\nchecking on the door.So talking about how we\ncan control the lift,so some of the\nthings we can do haveto do with the aircraft design.So we can build an airfoil.And we can talk about how curved\nthat airfoil is, the curvatureon the top, how curved it is.We can design the wing area.When we're flying, we\ncan control the airspeed.And then the angle of\nattack is somethingthat you can control when\nyou're in the airplaneby pitching down or pitching up.And we'll describe pitching\nand how you controlan airplane in more detail.Another thing that's\nrelevant is flaps.So I talked about in\nthis drawing righthere where I added this white\npart of the trailing edge thatmoves down, that really is\nkind of similar to flaps.So when your flaps are up,\nthey're sort of in linewith the rest of the wing.But when your flaps\nare down, it'sthe effective thing\nlike pushing--pulling a piece of your\ntrailing edge downward,which causes again more of that\nair to be deflected downward.So it increases your\ndrag, but it alsoincreases your lift because\nyou're deflecting more airmolecules down.And then we also talked\nabout spoilers, for example,as something that\ncan, like on a car,that can actually disrupt the\nlift by disrupting the airflow.And when we talked about\nthe four forces of flight,if you're doing steady\nflight, you're not climbingor you're descending, but\nyou're just flying straight,that means that your\nlift and your weightbasically cancel each other out.If your lift is greater\nthan your weight,then you can climb.And if your weight is\ngreater than your lift,then you descend.But if you're just\nflying straight,you're in an equilibrium where\nthose two forces cancel out.So good.I have a more detailed\ndiagram of angle of attack.So you can see here\nthe chord line.", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "You can also see the\nrelative wind and same thingsthat I drew here--the lift and the drag and then\nthat resultant force vector.So you can actually\ncontrol the angle of attackin a number of ways.One of the ways that we\ntalked about is pitching down.So pushing your yoke\nforward causes the airplaneto pitch down.And it does that by\nchanging the elevatorat the back of the airplane.We'll describe that\nin more detail.But the other things that can\naffect the angle of attack,you can actually affect\nbefore you even take off.So it has to do with\nyour aircraft weight,for example, and the\ncenter of gravity,as well as your airspeed\nwhen you're flying.So here are a couple of\ndiagrams that show youhow the lift changes with the\neffective angle of attack,and then there is a\ncritical angle of attack.So that's when you can\nkeep climbing for a while.But if you get too\nsteep, what happens?Who knows what happens\nwhen you go to steep?AUDIENCE: You stall.TINA SRIVASTAVA: You stall.That's right.So the air can't really\neffectively go over the wing.And it starts separating.And so you're no\nlonger effectivelypushing the air down.And you lose the lift\nthat you were generating.And one thing I also\nwant to point out herein these diagrams is you see\nwith these little colored linesthe air that's coming in.And it's going out.And you can see\nthat in this case,the blue lines are\nshowing that the air thatwent over the top of the airfoil\nwent

{"text": "A, B, or C?AUDIENCE: A.TINA SRIVASTAVA: A. Good.So the angle of attack\nis defined there.And one thing that I\nwould like to point outis that this is also the\ncase for a propeller.So your propeller also\nlooks a lot like an airfoilor like a wing that's\nsideways and spinning around.And so also the angle of\nattack for a propelleris defined basically\nthe same wayis the angle between\nthe propeller's chordline and the relative wind.So let's define the\ncenter of pressure.So it's basically\nthe point on the wingwhere the lift is centered.And so that can actually move\nas you can see in this figure.Based on the angle of attack,\nthe center of pressurecan act in a different location.And that's really important\nto understand alsothat it's not that the\nlift is always coming rightat the front.Depending on where you are,\nit might be pulling youin different directions.And that can affect\nthe maneuverabilityof your aircraft.And we'll get into\nthat in more detail.So we talked a little\nbit about flaps,that flaps actually\ncan increase the liftthat you're able to produce.But it's a trade-off because\nit also increases the drag.So when in the course of\nthe flight, takeoff, cruise,or landing, when\ndo you use flaps?Does anyone know?AUDIENCE: Takeoff and landing.TINA SRIVASTAVA:\nTakeoff and landing.Landing.Yeah, the reason that you,\nespecially on landing--many times people use\nflaps on takeoff as well.But the reason is\njust that you like", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.308}, {"text": "to have your aircraft\nconfigured that in caseyou didn't take off, you\ncan land without makinga lot of dramatic changes.The reason that you\ndo that is basicallythat by increasing your lift\nbut also increasing the drag,drag affects how fast\nyou're moving forward.And so you can actually\nhave the airspeedbe higher with the\nground speed being lower.What it does is it allows you to\ngo very slow without stalling.And so that really helps\nyou land an airplane.So basically, it\nallows you to comein at a kind of\nsteeper angle to land,maintaining the airspeed that\nyou need in order to do that.And you'll notice that there\nare different flap settings.So you can either have flaps\nat 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30degrees.We'll discuss that\nin more detail.And Phillip will talk\nabout it in termsof performance I think as well.Thrust-- so we talked about\nthat forward force thrust.In this type of an aircraft,\na single engine propelleraircraft, it's the\npropeller that'srotating that is really\nproducing the thrust.And it's really, as I\nsaid, the propeller bladesare kind of like\nan airplane wing--it's a good way to\nthink about it--that are just spinning round\nand round and generating lift.But in this case, it's\nmoving air molecules front tobehind your airplane.And then although this is\nalso just a force, insteadof talking about it\nin pounds, we usuallytalk about the\nhorsepower requiredto drive the propeller.So let me also talk about drag.So there are a couple\ndifferent types of drag.So one drag is just what's\ncalled parasitic dragor parasite drag.It's basically when the aircraft\nis moving through the airthat you get some kind\nof resistance to that.That's parasitic drag, whereas\nthis drag is induced drag,", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.32}, {"text": "which is the drag that's created\nby the lift, so this backwardsD. And so you can\nsee in this figurethat the total drag is a\nsum of that induced dragand the parasite drag.AUDIENCE: Do we also call\nthe induced drag just liftin an unwanted direction?TINA SRIVASTAVA: Lift in\nan unwanted direction.Sure, whatever can have\nyou associate induced dragwith lift.That's the drag created by lift.Ground effect-- does anyone\nknow a ground effect is?Only a couple of you.So let's talk about\nit a little bit.So basically, when you're very\nclose to the ground within onewing span of the\nground, you actuallyhave some of the airflow\ngoing on with your airplane isblocked by the ground.And so your induced\ndrag decreases.Now, with the induced\ndrag decreases,it's actually the case\nthat your airplanecan become airborne at a lower\nspeed than it's supposed to.So what you might\nnotice is that whenyou're on the\nrunway taking off--this is probably the first\npart of your flights.After you did your\npre-flight, your engine runup,you pulled out onto the runway.And you'll have\ndetermined in advancewhat is the air speed at\nwhich you should rotate.Now, that's really important.With a Cessna 172, for\nexample, it's around 55 knots.And you want to look at\nyour airspeed indicator.Because if you\njust feel yourself,you might notice that\nmuch lower, like 40 knots,that the plane has\nalready taken off.You're already floating.You're flying.And you might be very\nexcited about that.And you might want to just pull\nback on your yoke to take off.Well, you won't be\nable to sustain flight.And so this is what why ground\neffect is really important", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.197}, {"text": "is that you can kind of\nfloat over the groundbecause you're so\nclose to the groundthat the ground is blocking\nsome of the effects of the air.And so what you want to\ndo is

knots,and then you pull back\non your yoke to take off.So again, so when does\nground effect happen?When you're close\nto the ground--when you're within one\nwing span of the groundSo let's talk a little\nbit about stability.And we'll start by just talking\nabout the three axes of flight.So there is a\nlongitudinal axis, whichis basically from the nose\nto the tail of your airplane.And there's a\nlateral axis, whichis from wingtip to wingtip and\nthen vertical going straightthrough the plane.So you have the ability\nto control all threeof those axes.So the elevator, which I keep\ntalking about is like your yokewhere you push it forward\nor you pull it back,that allows you to\npitch the airplane.So pitch nose up,\npitch nose down--that's you controlling the\nback part of this tail,the elevator, which\nallows you to havemotion in this direction,\nso pitch nose down.So you might hear that a lot.In case you're getting\nclose to stallingbecause your angle of\nattack is getting too high,they might say, nose\ndown or pitch nose down.You also have\nailerons, which are outon the side of your wings.And those ailerons\ncontrol the roll.So that's rolling along\nthe longitudinal axis.And then your rudder, which\nis at the back of the tail,the vertical part of the tail--that controls yaw.", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.155}, {"text": "So this is called yaw,\nthis type of motion.So when you're turning, you\nactually kind of do a rolland yaw usually to enact a turn.There are some cases\nwhere you actuallywant to have adverse\nyaw or you actually--adverse yaw means\nbasically you'reusing the yaw direction in maybe\nthe opposite direction at whichyou're trying to turn with\nthe roll or other anglesof your plane.And so this just talks\nabout an adverse yawis when you're not turning the\nrudder in the same directionthat you're using your aileron.And so this is where you\ntalk about coordinated flightor uncoordinated flight.When you're actually in an\nairplane, the rudder or the yawis controlled by your feet.So you have feet pedals\nthat control the rudder.And the yoke that\nyou're holding ontoor a joystick that you're\nholding onto front and backcontrols the pitch.And then turning it like in\nthe steering wheel of a caris only controlling the roll.So you actually\nalso use your feetfor that third\ndirection of the yaw.So just talking about\nstability in general,this isn't going to dive\ninto a whole diffy qdiscussion or anything.But just in general,\nsomething that's stable--so it's just talking\nabout like a little bowlif you have a ball in a bowl,\neven if the ball gets jostledaround, it'll return\nto the center point.Unstable would be the opposite.So if you have a convex\nsurface, then if the ball moveseven just a little\nbit, it'll reallyget moved out of control.So the reason that\nwe talk about thisis basically when you're\nflying in an airplane,and you're talking\nabout stable aircraft,for example, the

notice the plane's\ndoing something weirdand turning, almost the\nbest thing you can dois just let go.And the controls will\nnormalize, and then the planewill fly straight and level,\nwhich is really great.There are other\ntypes of aircraftthat are inherently unstable.So we have Minachi\nand Oxsana over herewho do aerobatic flights.And Mark will be talking\nabout that tomorrow.So that's where\nyou actually wantan airplane that's not\nso stable so that youcan cause it to do all kinds\nof crazy maneuvers and turnsand twists very easily.You pretty much can't\nget a Cessna to do that.It really wants to fly\nstraight and level.So then there are\nalso other aspectsthat can affect stability,\nsuch as your center of gravity,so how you load the airplane.We'll have a specific\nlecture that justtalks about weight and balance.But one thing to keep in\nmind is that as peoplesit in your airplane\nor as you put bagsin the baggage compartment,\nyou're loading the airplane.And so if you have too\nmuch weight aft of the CGor behind the center\nof gravity, youcan cause the plane\nto basically golike this, which isn't very\nhelpful when you're flying.If you have things a\nlittle too forward,it actually pushes\nthe nose down.In general, the nose\ndown is a little bitmore stable from the\nperspective of liftand getting air to fly over.You don't want\nsomething that keepstrying to stall whenever\nyou let go of it.And then similarly, you can\ntalk about the stabilityin the lateral direction\nin the roll direction.And some of these things\nlike swept-back wingslike you see on a

attack,it can cause the air to\nbasically no longer beable to flow over the top and\nno longer be able to effectivelydeflect air down.And so the air\nkind of separates.And you can stall.So it's really important to\nknow that you can actuallystall at any airspeed.Even with full\npower, you can stall.In fact, one of the\nmaneuvers you'llhave to do in order to\nget your pilot's licenseis a power on stall.So you can stall both\nwhere your engine is idle,like you're coming in for a\nlanding, and you get too steep,but you can also\nstall with full power.And you just made your\nangle go too steep.So it's really affecting that\ncritical angle of attack.And again, once you have that\nangle of attack too steep,then there's a very significant\nloss of lift, which is not goodwhen you're flying an airplane.So when can you stall?At any airspeed and\nany power setting,and it's really based\non the angle of attack.So if you-- yes, go ahead.AUDIENCE: So what happens\nafter the end of the graph?Does

extra\npaper folding at the frontso that the nose will go down.But it's really bad basically.If you stall, it\ncan go that way.The other thing that can\nhappen after you stall a lotusually is you can\nenter a spin, whichis actually the next case.So this is when you're\nuncoordinated in your stall.So what I mean by uncoordinated?So that's what I was just\ntalking about before,where your roll and\nyour yaw are notgoing in the same direction.And here you can have\na situation whereboth of the wings have stalled.So the airflow has separated\nover both of the wings.But one may be more\nstalled than the other.And it causes the airplane to\nhave a very, very hazardouscondition or an\nintentional conditionif you're Oxsana over\nthere, and you'retrying to spin your airplane\nto do a fancy trick.This is very dangerous\nclose to the ground.As you'll hear, you\nonly intentionallydo this in certain\ntypes of aircraftwhen you're wearing\nparachutes in certain airspacewhen you're

flying straight\nand level, that'skind of when you're at\nan equilibrium whereyour lift and your weight\nkind of cancel out.And the plane's just\ngoing straight and levelat the same altitude.But

also\nnot accelerating.Now, this is a little\nbit complicated,so I will say this is\na little bit tricky.There is a tendency for\nthese airplanes to turn left.And there are actually\nmultiple thingsthat contribute to this\nleft-turning tendency.And when you're in\nan airplane flying,you might hear your\ninstructor say right rudder.And it is really\nto counteract someof these left-turning\ntendencies.So we're going to break them\ndown and talk about them.But this can be a\nvery in-depth subject,so I will definitely\nrefer to the PHAK, whichis the Pilot Handbook of\nAeronautical Knowledge.Chapter 5 goes\ninto all of these.So the first one is torque.So basically, the thing is\nwhen you're-- if you're sittingin the airplane, and\nyou're looking forwardat your propeller, most\nUS engines actually havethe propeller\nrotating clockwise.So and you can see that\narrow that says action.That's the propeller\nrotating clockwise.And so because of Newton,\nwe know for every action,there's an equal and\nopposite reaction.So because the propeller\nis turning to the right,the whole airplane is\ntrying to roll to the left.So that is the first\nleft-turning tendency.Before we move to the next\none, are there any questionson this left-turning tendency?Great.So the next one\nis p-factor, whichis an asymmetrical thrust.This happens when the airplane\nhas a high angle of attack,", "start": 3360.0, "heat": 0.146}, {"text": "so either when it's climbing\nor in this condition calledslow flight, which is where it's\nkind of an uncomfortable thing.You have to do this in\nyour flight training.So basically, you have your\npower setting pretty high,but you've kind of\npitched the airplane up.And so you're not getting as\nmuch airflow over your controlsurfaces like your\nailerons and your elevator.So they call your\ncontrols mushy.So it's hard to kind of\ncoordinate your airplane.But you kind of sit\nin that environmentto basically understand how\nit's difficult to controlthe airplane in\nthat environment.So if you're pitched up, and\nyou have a-- so you have a highangle of attack, and you're\neither climbing or in slowflight, you have this\ntendency where the--because you're\nangled to the wind,the right propeller blade,\nwhich is descending,is kind of cutting into\nthe air as it's coming in.So it's actually\ngenerating more thrust,whereas the ascending\nleft propeller blade,so the propeller blade that's\ngoing up on the left sideis kind of coming away from\nthe wind that's coming at it.And so it's not\ngenerating as much thrustas the right propeller blade.So that causes the\ncenter of thrustto move towards the right.And that creates a little bit of\na yaw tendency of the airplane.Does that make sense?Great.Lot of head nods.P-factor was one that\nboth Phillip and Ispent quite a bit of time\ngetting our heads around.And Professor Hansman\nhelped us out there.So another one is called\nthe corkscrew effect.Sometimes, it's\ncalled slipstreamor spiraling slipstream.It basically has\nto do with the factthat that propeller remember is\njust kind of like a wing that'sspinning around.And so it's basically\npushing the air back.And since the propeller\nis spinning around,", "start": 3480.0, "heat": 0.231}, {"text": "that air that's coming\nback from the propelleris spinning around the airplane.And as it spins

doesn't it\nalso cause it to roll?TINA SRIVASTAVA: Why doesn't\nit also cause it to rollwas the question.And it could, especially\nif it's hitting the wing.But in general,\nwhat we've seen isthat it can depend\non whether you'rein a high wing or low wing.But the biggest thing that\nit sort of hits is here.Now, in general, when\nyou get to a left yaw,you sort of kind of roll.These are connected angles.But I think just\nwhat we've observedis primarily that\nthe air, when it hitsthe vertical stabilizer, is\nthe biggest surface that'skind of pushing it and\nthe angle that it's at.So if you sum it\nall together, yes.I'm actually quite confident\nyou'll get some roll,but the biggest thing that\nyou notice is the yaw.So let's see if we\nunderstood p-factoras well as we think we did.A, B, or C?AUDIENCE: A.TINA SRIVASTAVA: A. Good job.I actually have my little hint\nthere that the B is actuallytalking about torque, which\nis a different left-turningtendency.And then finally, we're\ngoing to talk a little bitabout gyroscopic precession.It's a little bit\ncomplicated if you're notfamiliar with the gyroscope.But when Phillip\ntalks to you about allthe different controls\nin your airplane,", "start": 3600.0,

you can hold.It's spinning.You can play with them.What they allow you to do\nis have rigidity in space.And they also have this\nconcept of precession.And precession is basically\nthat the resultant actionof a spinning rotor when a\ndeflecting force is appliedhappens 90 degrees\nahead of that rotation.And so because of that,\nyou can consider that the--you have the propeller\nspinning, and that causesthis gyroscopic precession.And that basically\ncauses 90 degrees outof that sink is this\nforce which causesa yawing movement, a pitching\nand a yawing in this case.Once we talk more

understand the\nkey fundamentals of gyroscopes.Yes.AUDIENCE: So why is p-factor\na left-turning tendencyand not a pitch up tendency?TINA SRIVASTAVA: Sure.So let's go back to p-factor.So what we're talking\nabout is the differencein the center of thrust.So the thrust, when\nyou're straight and level,the thrust is just forward.But what we're seeing is\nthat when the right blade,because when you're in\na high angle of attack,the right blade is\ngenerating more thrustthan the left blade.So the center of thrust\nis slightly to the right.So that is why because it's to\nthe right and not up or down.Up or down would cause\na pitch up or down.But since it's to\nthe right, that'swhy it's causing the yaw action.", "start": 3720.0, "heat": 0.141}, {"text": "AUDIENCE: So it is not\n90 degrees ahead becauseof precession.TINA SRIVASTAVA: So\nprecession is separate.It is generating its own\nfactors and dynamics.So both of these things are\nacting at the same time.So precession does\nin fact affect pitchjust like you\ncorrectly recognized.But this is an\nadditional factor that'shappening is that since\nthe center of thrustis actually moved to the\nright, it's causing the yawing.Did that answer your question?AUDIENCE: No, but that's OK.TINA SRIVASTAVA: You want\nto chime in, Phillip?AUDIENCE: It's an external\nforce, as opposed to generatingby the propeller.PHILLIP GREENSPUN: It's\na little bit tough.I think, yeah, we should\ntable it and refer youto that physics book See How\nIt Flies, which has some of it.But the one thing I\nwould add on p-factoris another thing\nto keep in mind iswhether the propeller is\nadvancing or retreatinginto the wind.So if you think about it,\nwhen the airplane is level,the propeller is not moving\nrelative to the oncoming wind.But if you tilt the airplane\nup, as the propeller goes down,it's actually\nadvancing into the windand getting a little bit of\nan efficiency boost that way.Whereas when it's\ncoming up, it'sgoing from the front of the\nairplane towards the backof the airplane.So it's retreatingTINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah, so\nwhat Phillip's describingis why the right propeller\nblade is generating more thrustthan the left propeller\nblade, which is what'smoving the center of thrust.So I think the real thing\nto answer your questionis that there's more\nthan one effect happeningsimultaneously.Yeah, so the--PHILLIP GREENSPUN:\nI'm not sure that youget gyroscopic precession\nfrom that actionhere because it's generating\nlift by pushing air.I'm not sure that\nall the thrust reallyhas to go through,\nfor p-factor at least,through the center of\nthe spinning propeller.", "start": 3840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Also, I know in helicopters,\nthe physics 101 answeris 90 degrees.But the real answer

propeller.So the p is referring\nto that propeller,right propeller\nmore than the left.It also usually happens when\nyou're at a higher power.So some flight\ninstructors like youto think about when you have\nhigher power in the airplane,you need to put on\nmore right rudderto counteract that\nleft-turning tendency.PHILLIP GREENSPUN: We're\na little bit behind.Should we take our bathroom\nbreak now and then--TINA SRIVASTAVA: I'm\nactually almost done,so I think we can finish there.So one thing is to talk-- so\nwe talked about with climbingflight, f equals ma.So once you're done\nchanging the velocity,and you don't have a\nchange in velocity,your forces are in equilibrium.So the same is the case\nwith a descending flight.When you're actually\nturning, your forcesare not in equilibrium\nbecause you'rehaving this change in velocity.And so you actually have a\nnumber of changes happening.And it's basically considered\naccelerated flight,which is same as when you're\ndriving if you're turning.So when you're flying,\nwhen you're doing a turn,you're accelerating because\nyou're constantly changingthe direction of your velocity.You also have load\nfactor,

our\nexperiments, whenyou go to the bottom\nof the parabola,you basically get 2G or\ntwice what you normally feel.And so you have to kind of\nlay down and let that happenbefore you come up again.And so when you think\nabout load factor,just think about you\nbeing at the bottomof your roller coaster\nand really feelinga kind of twice\nthat force on you.And then just to\nkind of end, we wantto talk about most of the time\nwe're talking about the planesthat you'd be flying, but\nanother type of aircraftaltogether is a blended\nwing body aircraft.So just like this is\none example of that.So what it means is\nthat that fuselageor that kind of tube in\nthe middle that you sit inis blended into the wings\nso that the whole body isgenerating more lift\nbecause the whole surface iskind of designed that way.It's really kind of cool.And from an aerodynamic\nperspective,it's got a much better\nlift to drag ratiobecause the whole\nthing is reallydeflecting the air molecules\ndownward and generatingthat lift.So I just asked kind\nof a thought question.If this is so much better, it's\nmore efficient of an aircraftand aerodynamically has much\nbetter properties, why do you--it actually-- we've\nalso found that it'sbetter in terms\nof fuel efficiencybecause it has less\ndrag and more lift.Why do you think that\nJetBlue and American Airlinesdon't fly aircraft\nthat look like this?AUDIENCE: They don't have routes\nwith a thousand passengers.TINA SRIVASTAVA: They\ndon't have routeswith a thousand passengers?Well, you could make a smaller\nblended wing body aircraft.", "start": 4080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Yes.AUDIENCE: Passengers\nlike windows.TINA SRIVASTAVA:\nPassengers like windows.That's actually a big--it's a big reason truthfully.Yes.AUDIENCE: It's very different\nfrom what's currently made,so the development would\nbe expensive and risky.TINA SRIVASTAVA: So it's\nvery different from what'scurrently made.And then you said\nso the developmentwould be very risky.Actually, I think it's more\nthan just the development.Because it's different\nfrom what's currently made,the entire infrastructure\nsupports the current formatof an airplane with\na tube and wings.So we're talking about\nairports, jet bridges,the way that people load\nfood carts onto a plane,the way that passengers\nget on and off,the fact the\npassengers don't haveas many windows on\nthis type of aircraft.It's unfortunately that\nwhole infrastructurethat surrounds it that is a\nbig contributing factor to why,even though there's\na better design, whywe don't move towards that.So this was a big,\nbig thing for mewhen I was an undergrad\nat MIT aero-astro.I'm thinking I'm going to design\nthe next best amazing airplane.But even if you do design the\nnext best amazing airplane,it may not be widely\ndeployed becauseof these other infrastructure\naspects, which really got meinto systems engineering.But enough with that\nthought exercise.For time, we'll just summarize\nwhat did we learn today.So we talked about how does\nan airplane generate lift?And we talked about different\nfactors that affect lift.We also discussed that lift\nis very hard to calculate.And so we experimentally\nmeasure a lot of aspects of it.And we discussed the different\nforces on an airplane--stability, and kind of this\nleft-turning tendencies,and some of the different\naircraft configurations.So are there any\nquestions about that?PHILLIP GREENSPUN:\nYeah, Tina, whatdo you think about\nlet's do questions,let's take a bathroom\nbreak, and then--TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah, so\nyou can think about it.PHILLIP GREENSPUN: People\nwith questions talk.I'm going to call\nthe pizza peopleand give them my credit card.", "start": 4200.0, "heat": 0.116}]
