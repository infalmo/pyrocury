we're showing\nthe length scales--that's in nature-- and length\nscales for what we make,artificially.Later of course, we\nhave the biological sideyou can see going\nfrom molecules to DNAto bacteria

nanometersand to nanowires and\nnanoelectronics, where this isactually quite a few year old.I think the gate length\nin semiconductorsnow is just around a few\ntenths, 10, 20 nanometers.So those are

questions,because you have learned a\nlot in the transport theory,for example--the question is are\nthey valid or notand if they are not valid,\nwhat are the alternatives.And also, we're\nnot just to lookingat the individual nanoparticles.When you put them\ntogether into macro scale,what's the picture there?So this is where this course\nis trying to wrestle with.And that's in fact--most of my research is\nlooking into thinkinghow we can look at the\nsmall and then how usingthe small to do the big things.Particularly, most of\nthe work I'm working onis heat transfer related\nto energy and energyas a large scale, so how I can\ntake small to go to the large.And let me give you two\nexamples from researchto show that when\nyou go to nanoscale,the classical theory that\nyou have learned breaks down.And the first example is\na heat conduction example.We know in heat conduction\nwe have Fourier law.And we have thermal\nconductivity of the materials.And this is one example of nano.This is in fact transmission\nelectron microscopeimage of a layered structure.One layer, the bright\nlayer is silicon.The darker layer is germanium.So each layer is\nabout 2 nanometers.And then when you measure\nthermal conductivity--so you can take a silicon\nbecause one layer is silicon.The other is germanium.So you have started\nheat transfer.It's parallel plates.And then you can do\nthermal resistorsto say what's the effect\nwith thermal conductivity.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.163}, {"text": "And you can say if I\ntake a silicon germaniumthermal conductivity,\nI will predictthat's the

to\ngo to Boltzmann equationto predict now--See, this is a work that we\nstarted in 90's, and now we'redoing quantum calculations\non those structures.So there's significant departure\nfrom the classical theorywhen you go to nano scales.And as another\nexample, you learnedin thermal radiation,\n[? black ?] bodyis the maximum of\nthermal radiation.But, see, say when\nwe go to nanoscale,when we put the two objects\nsmaller, the distance-- thiswas on MIT web page.I really like this.They're very creative.What should I say?This is better than what we did.So that's Planck's law,\nblack body radiation.And that's usually\nconsidered maximum.And when we put two\nsurfaces down to nanoscale--right here is one micron, 100\nnanometer, and 10 nanometer.We can go beyond\nthe Planck's lawby several order of magnitude.When I say this is three\norder of magnitude--we're now at the four\norder of magnitude.And we're looking at what\nhappens between that onenanometer and contact.And you say, why you cares?The fact is when I put\nmany materials together,they say it's\nreally particularlywhen I'm doing nano.It's really the\ninterface dominance.And so that interface\nsometimes contact each
