[{"text": "CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome\nback to recitation.In this video I want\nto explain to youwhere the coefficients\nwe saw in Simpson's ruleactually come from.So what I'm going to do is\ntake this curve that I haveand show you what the picture\nof Simpson's rule does.And then I'm actually going\nto determine explicitly wherethe coefficients come from.So let's look at\nthis picture first.The picture I have here, the\nwhite curve is going to be my yequals f of x function.And so, if you remember, what\nSimpson's rule is saying,you have to have two delta x's.So in this case h\nis equal to delta x.So what Simpson's rule is saying\nis I can find, approximate,the area under this\ncurve from minush to h by a certain expression.And the expression is, I\nsaid delta x is equal to h,so let me write h over 3 times\ny_0 plus 4*y_1 plus y_2-- oh,y_2.So that's what you got--that's what you\nsaw in the lecture,that this is what\nthe coefficients are.So I want to explain\nwhy this is a 1, whythat's a 4, why that's a 1,\nand where that 3 comes from.The picture is not\ngoing to explain it,but the picture will help\nus understand how to go.So what Simpson's rule does is\nit takes those three points,so the (x_0, y_0) the (x_1,\ny_1) and the (x_2, y_2)that are on the curve\ny equals f of x.And it finds a parabola\nthrough those three points.So I'm going to do my best to\ndraw what looks like a parabolathrough those three points.Something-- I'll draw it lightly\nfirst and then I'll fill it in.Something along these lines.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Something like that.That's a, sort of\nlooks like a parabola.And so the idea\nis Simpson's ruleis saying I can find the\narea under the blue curve.So I can find the area\nunder the blue curve.So this is a function, we'll\ncall this y equal P of x.And that's what you were\nactually told about in lecture.That you're approximating\nyour function yequals f of x by a\nquadratic function thatgoes through the values\n(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1),and (x_2, y_2).And then you find the\narea under that parabola.Between minus h and h.Now this picture, you\nmight say, Christine,this looks really\nlike a bad estimate.This looks kind of stupid.Maybe you should have\npicked a different functionto estimate this.And I did this one because I\nwanted to be zoomed out farand to show you, to give you\na little intuition about whathappens when we make h smaller.Notice that if I\ncut the size of hin half, so if I started\nwith here was minus h to h,what would my three points be?My three points would be\nthis point, y_1, and y_2would be right here.Well the quadratic\nthrough those pointsis much closer to\nthe actual function.And if I cut that in half\nagain, I'd have points here,here, and here.Something like that,\nand that startsto look almost exactly\nlike a quadratic.So if I found the\narea under this--or if I wanted to\nestimate the areaunder this piece\nof the curve usinga quadratic through\nthose three points,they would be very close.So don't be alarmed\nby Simpson's ruleas an approximation based\non this large picture.So now, what do we have to do?Remember, what's our goal?Our goal is to figure out where\nthe coefficients come from.So what I actually\nneed to do is I needto evaluate a certain integral.Or I need to integrate\na certain function.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "I need to integrate P of x.So what I'm going to be finding\nthrough the rest of this video,is the integral from\nminus h to h of P of x dx.And my goal is to show\nthat this integral isequal to this expression.I want to show that\nthese are equal.That's my goal.So let's get down to it.What do I know?What's the only thing I know\nright away about P of x?I know I'm choosing it to\nbe a quadratic functionand I know it goes through\nthree certain points.Right?I'll write down what the three\npoints are when we need them.But first let's just\nsay, in general,let's take this integral\nfor a general quadraticand see how much information\nwe actually need.So let me come over here.Actually, let me say first, what\ndo I mean my general quadratic?I mean something of the\nform big A, capital A,x squared plus B*x plus C.\nSo I'm not filling in valuesfor these coefficients yet.Those coefficients are coming\nexactly from my three points.(x_0, y_0), (x_1,\ny_1), and (x_2, y_2).So let's just integrate\nthat from minus hto h first and see what\nkind of information we need.So if I come over here.So what do I get when I\nactually integrate this?Well, I get A x to\nthe third over 3,plus B x squared\nover 2, plus C*x,and then I have to\nevaluate from minus h to h.Well, if you were\nthinking about this,it shouldn't be surprising\nthat when I do this,there's not going\nto be a B term.Why is that?Well, these two\nfunctions are even.A x squared and C\nare even functions.And I'm integrating\nover something that's", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "symmetric about the y-axis.I'm going from minus h to h.So if you think\nabout A x squared,and I'm going from\nminus h to h, I'mfinding the area under a\nquadratic, from minus h to h,it's going to be twice\nthe area from 0 to h.But B*x, that's a\nline with slope B.If I wanted to integrate\nB*x from minus h to h,that's the area, the signed area\nunder the curve, of a line B*x,from minus h to h.If I just draw a quick picture,\nwhat does that look like?It's symmetric with respect\nto a rotation there.I'd have this signed area.This is the curve y equals B*x.From minus h to h, I get\nthis area is negativeand this are is positive\nand they're equal.So, what I'm about to do,\nyou shouldn't be surprisedthere won't be a B term.So what do we actually\nget when we evaluate this?We get 2A h cubed,\nover 3, plus 2*C*h.That's what we get.You can actually work it all,\nput in all the h's and seethat, but I knew I was\ngoing to have doublewhat was here when I\nevaluated at h, and nothingfrom the B term.So we're getting closer.We're getting closer.We might not look like\nwe're getting closer,but we're getting closer.So let's simplify this\nexpression a little bit.Actually, what I ultimately need\nto do is I need to figure out Cand I need to figure\nout something over here.I need to actually\nfigure out A h squared.And let me explain why I need\nto figure out A h squared.In the end, if I come\nover back to whatI want to show-- let me\neven box it, so we see it--I want to show that\nthis integral, whichI've started to calculate,\nis equal to h over3 times this quantity.So I want to keep\none around, but Iwant the other, any\nother powers of hto not be there when I'm done.Right?I need one power of h there.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "In fact I need an\nh over 3 there.So I think what I'll\ndo is I'll start offand I'll pull out an\nh over 3, and thenI'll try and figure out if I can\nget the rest of my expressionto look like what's\nin the parentheses.That's really, ultimately,\nwhat I'd like to do.So let's come back over here.I'm going to pull out an h\nover 3 from both of theseand we're going to see\nwhat we end up with.OK so if I pull out an h over\n3 here, what do I end up with?This is easy.That's 2A h squared.And this one's a\nlittle bit trickier.But I have to multiply by\n3 over 3 to get a 3 there.So I end up with 6C.OK.Let's make sure I didn't\nmake any mistakes.If I multiply through here\nI get 2A h cubed over 3.If I multiply through here I\nget 2h*C. Looking good so far.Now I have to figure out A and\nC, or A h squared and C. Well,C is pretty easy to find.Let's think about why that is.I have this polynomial.The polynomial was equal to--\nif we come over here and we lookagain, it's A x squared\nplus B*x plus C.And the polynomial has to go\nthrough those three points Ihad.So when x is 0, P of 0\nis C. So let's come backand look at our picture.When x is 0, what's the\noutput on the white curve?It's y_1.So C is exactly y_1.How am I going to\nfind A h squared?Well, what I need to do is\nuse these other two points.I'm going to evaluate the\nfunction P of x at minus h.And its output has to be y_0.And I'm going to evaluate\nthe function P of x at hand its output has to be y_2.So we're going to come\nover to the other side,but that's really\nwhat we're doing next.So let's come over here\nand let's evaluate P of hand P of minus h.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.154}, {"text": "So P of h is A h\nsquared plus B*h plus C.And P of minus h is A h\nsquared minus B*h plus C. OK.What else?Again we said this one\nhas to be y_2, the output,and this one has to be y_0.Because the output\nat h has to agreewith the output of\nthe function f of x.And its output at h was y_2.The output at minus\nh of P has to bethe same as the output\nat minus h of f.And that was y_0.Now this might not\nlook fun yet but whatif I add these two\nthings together.What happens?I get 2A h squared.These drop out.And then I get plus 2C\nis equal to y_0 plus y_2.I'm getting closer.I'm getting much closer.Because now notice what I have.I have 2A h squared,\nI can isolate that.And that's something that\nI want to figure out.I want to figure\nout 2A h squared.So let's figure\nout what that is.2A h squared is equal to\ny_0 plus y_2 minus, wellwhat did we say C was?C was the output at x equals 0.Which is y1.So it's minus 2C, which is minus\n2y_1 So now we're very close,we're very close to\ngetting what we want.And that's good, because\nI'm almost out of room.So let's take that\nexpression, wewere working on this\nexpression right here,and let's start to\nfill in what we get.We get h over 3\ntimes 2A h squared,which is y_0 plus\ny_2 minus 2y_1,", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.266}, {"text": "and then I have to add 6C.Now what's C?C is y_1.So I'm going to add 6y_1.And if I simplify that, I\nget y_0-- bingo-- plus 4y_1plus y_2.And that's what we wanted.So let me take us through\nkind of where all this camefrom again, what the big pieces\nwere and we'll see now weunderstand how we do Simpson's\nrule, and these small chunksof Simpson's rule.So let's come back to\nthe very beginning.OK, in the very beginning,\nwhat we had was a functionf of x, that was\nthe white curve.y equals f of x was\nthe white curve.And then I found\na quadratic thatwent through minus h, y0,\n(0, y_1), and (h, y_2).Went through those three points.And I called that\nquadratic P of x.And then what I\nwas doing, we knowSimpson's rule says find the\narea under the curve of Pof x between minus h and h.So what I did was\nI came over hereand I said OK, P of x, integral\nof P of x from minus h to h.I wrote P of x in a\nvery general form.And then I actually\nfound an integral.I came through and\nafter writing it out,calculating the integral,\nI got to this expression.This is actually the integral\nof P of x from minus h to h.So it's the area under the curve\nof P of x from minus h to his that.And now I had to\nfigure this out,how to write this in terms\nof the outputs of f of x.Which were y_0, y_1, and y_2.Those were the ones\nwe were interested in.So I ultimately knew I wanted\nan h over three in front.I knew I wanted my integral\nin my quadratic to beh over 3 times something,\nso I pulled out an h over 3,and then I looked at\nwhat this expression was.And if I could get\nthis expressionto look like the inside\nof what I wanted,which was y_0 plus 4y_1\nplus y_2, I was in business.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.331}, {"text": "And so then I used\noutputs that Iknew for P of x to\nfind 2A h squaredand to find C. I know P of h\nis the output of the f of xfunction at the far\nright, which was y_2.And I knew P of minus h\nwas the output of the fof x function at the far left.That's y_0.I actually then evaluate\nP at h and minus h,and when I add those together,\nI get my 2A h squaredin terms of y_0, y_1, and y_2.Let me do this in terms\nof y_0, y_1, and y_2.Because I also knew C was y_1.We talked about that as well.C had to be y_1.So I can then do the\nsubstitution I need right hereand show where the coefficients\nin Simpson's rule come from.So hopefully that was\ninformative for you.And I think I'll stop there.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.29}]
