story so far is\nbasically three postulates.The first is that the\nconfiguration of a particleis given by, or described\nby, a wave function psi of x.Yeah?So in particular, just to\nflesh this out a little more,if we were in 3D, for\nexample-- which we're not.We're currently in\nour one dimensionaltripped out tricycles.In 3D, the wave function\nwould be a functionof all three\npositions x, y and z.If we had two particles,\nour wave functionwould be a function of the\nposition of each particle.x1, x2, and so on.So we'll go through lots of\ndetails and examples later on.But for the most\npart, we're goingto be sticking with\nsingle particle in onedimension for the\nnext few weeks.Now again, I want to emphasize\nthis is our first passthrough our definition\nof quantum mechanics.Once we use the language and\nthe machinery a little bit,we're going to develop a more\ngeneral, more coherent set", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "of rules or definition\nof quantum mechanics.But this is our first pass.Two, the meaning of\nthe wave functionis that the norm squared psi of\nx, norm squared, it's complex,dx is the probability of\nfinding the particle- There'san n in their.Finding the particle-- in the\nregion between x and x plus dx.So psi squared\nitself, norm squared,is the probability density.OK?And third, the\nsuperposition principle.If there are two\npossible configurationsthe system can be in,\nwhich in quantum mechanicsmeans two different\nwave functions thatcould describe the system\ngiven psi 1 and psi 2, twowave functions\nthat could describetwo different configurations\nof the system.For example, the particles here\nor the particles over here.It's also possible to find\nthe system in a superpositionof those two psi is\nequal to some arbitrarylinear combination alpha\npsi 1 plus beta psi 2 of x.OK?So some things to note--\nso questions about thosebefore we move on?No questions?Nothing?Really?You're going to make he\nthreaten you with something.I know there are questions.This is not trivial stuff.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "OK.So some things to note.The first is we\nwant to normalize.We will generally\nnormalize and requirethat the integral over\nall possible positionsof the probability density\npsi of x norm squaredis equal to 1.This is just saying that the\ntotal probability that we findthe particle somewhere\nhad better be one.This is like saying if\nI know a particle isin one of two\nboxes, because I'veput a particle in\none of the boxes.I just don't remember which one.Then the probability that\nit's in the first boxplus probability that\nit's in the second boxmust be 100% or one.If it's less, then the particle\nhas simply disappeared.And basic rule, things\ndon't just disappear.So probability\nshould be normalized.And this is our prescription.So a second thing to note is\nthat all reasonable, or nonstupid, functions\npsi of x are equallyreasonable as wave functions.OK?So this is a very\nreasonable function.It's nice and smooth.It converges to 0 infinity.It's got all the nice\nproperties you might want.This is also a\nreasonable function.It's a little annoying,\nbut there it is.And they're both perfectly\nreasonable as wave functions.This on the other\nhand, not so much.So for two reasons.First off, it's discontinuous.And as you're going to\nshow in your problem set,discontinuities are very\nbad for wave functions.So we need our wave\nfunctions to be continuous.The second is over some\ndomain it's multi valued.There are two different\nvalues of the function.That's also bad, because\nwhat's the probability?It's the norm squared,\nbut if it two values,two values for the probability,\nthat doesn't make any sense.What's the probability\nthat I'm goingto fall over in 10 seconds?", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Well, it's small, but it's not\nactually equal to 1% or 3%.It's one of those.Hopefully is much\nlower than that.So all reasonable\nfunctions are equallyreasonable as wave functions.And in particular, what\nthat means is all statescorresponding to\nreasonable wave functionsare equally reasonable\nas physical states.There's no primacy in wave\nfunctions or in states.However, with that said,\nsome wave functionsare more equal than others.OK?And this is important,\nand coming upwith a good\ndefinition of this isgoing to be an important\nchallenge for usin the next couple of lectures.So in particular,\nthis wave functionhas a nice simple\ninterpretation.If I tell you this\nis psi of x, thenwhat can you tell me about the\nparticle whose wave function isthe psi of x?What can you tell me about it?What do you know?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: It's here, right?It's not over here.Probability is basically 0.Probability is large.It's pretty much here with\nthis great confidence.What about this guy?Less informative, right?It's less obvious what this\nwave function is telling me.So some wave functions are\nmore equal in the sensethat they have-- i.e.they have simple\ninterpretations.So for example,\nthis wave functioncontinuing on infinitely, this\nwave function doesn't tell mewhere the particle is,\nbut what does it tell me?AUDIENCE: Momentum.PROFESSOR: The\nmomentum, exactly.So this is giving me\ninformation about the momentumof the particle because it\nhas a well defined wavelength.So this one, I would also say\nis more equal than this one.They're both perfectly\nphysical, but this onehas a simple interpretation.And that's going to\nbe important for us.Related to that is that any\nreasonable function psi of x", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "can be expressed as a\nsuperposition of moreequal wave functions,\nor more precisely easilyinterpretable wave

of x, as a\nsuperposition of states,not with definite\nmomentum, but of stateswith definite position.So what's a state with\na definite position?AUDIENCE: Delta.PROFESSOR: A delta\nfunction, exactly.So I claim that any\nfunction psi of xcan be expanded a\nsum over all stateswith a definite position.So delta of-- well, what's a\nstate with a definite position?x0.Delta of x minus x0.OK?This goes bing when\nx0 is equal to x.But I want a sum over all\npossible delta functions.That means all\npossible positions.That means all possible\nvalues of x0, dx0.And I need some\ncoefficient function here.Well, the coefficient function\nI'm going to call psi of x0.So is this true?Is it true that I\ncan take any functionand expand it in a superposition\nof delta functions?Absolutely.Because look at what\nthis equation does.Remember, delta\nfunction is your friend.It's a map from integrals\nto numbers or functions.So this integral, is\nan integral over x0.Here we have a\ndelta of x minus x0.So

well defined\nobservable quantityfor any observable\nquantity you want.So let me give you just a\nquick little bit of intuition.In 2D, this is a perfectly\ngood vector, right?Now here's a question\nI want to ask you.Is that a superposition?Yeah.I mean every vector\ncan be writtenas the sum of other\nvectors, right?And it can be done in an\ninfinite number of ways, right?So there's no such\nthing as a statewhich is not a superposition.Every vector is a\nsuperposition of other vectors.It's a sum of other vector.So in particular we often\nfind it useful to pick a basisand say look, I know what\nI mean by the vector y,y hat is a unit vector\nin this direction.I know what I mean\nby the vector x hat.It's a unit vector\nin this direction.And now I can ask, given that\nthese are my natural guys,the guys I want to attend\nto, is this a superpositionof x and y?Or is it just x or y?Well, that's a superposition.Whereas x hat itself is not.So this somehow is about finding\nconvenient choice of basis.But any given vector\ncan be expressedas a superposition of\nsome pair of basis vectorsor a different pair\nof basis vectors.There's nothing hallowed\nabout your choice of basis.There's no God given\nbasis for the universe.We look out in the universe\nin the Hubble deep field,and you don't see somewhere\nin the Hubble deep fieldan arrow going x, right?So there's no natural\nchoice of basis,but it's sometimes\nconvenient to pick a basis.This is the direction of\nthe surface of the earth.This is the direction\nperpendicular to it.So sometimes\nparticular basis setshave particular meanings to us.That's true in vectors.This is along the earth.This is perpendicular to it.This would be slightly strange.Maybe if you're leaning.And similarly, this\nis an expansionof a function as

a\nconvenient thing to note.The average value of a\nminus it's average value.Well, what's the\naverage value of 7?AUDIENCE: 7.PROFESSOR: OK, good.So that first term is\nthe average value of a.And that

measureof the actual width\nof the system.But we can get a nice measure by\ngetting the deviation squared.And let's take the mean\nof the derivation squared.So the mean of the derivation\nsquared,

at this pointwith the following observation.[LAUGHTER]We live in a world\ngoverned by probabilities.There's a finite probability\nthat, at any given moment,that two pirates might\nwalk into a room, OK?[LAUGHTER]You just never know.[APPLAUSE]But those probabilities can be\ncomputed in quantum mechanics.And they're computed\nin the following ways.They're computed\nthe following waysas we'll study in great detail.If I take a state, psi of x,\nwhich is equal to e to the ikx,this is a state that has\ndefinite momentum h bar k.Right?We claimed this.This was de Broglie\nand Davisson-Germer.Note the following,\ntake this operatorand act on this wave\nfunction with this operator.What do you get?Well, we already\nknow, because weconstructed it to\nhave this property.P hat on psi of\nx-- and I'm goingto call this psi sub\nk of x, because ithas a definite k-- is equal\nto h bar k psi k of x.A state with a definite\nmomentum has the propertythat, when you hit it with\nthe operation associated", "start": 4320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "with momentum, you get back the\nsame function times a constant,and that constant is\nexactly the momentum weascribe to that plane wave.Is that cool?Yeah?AUDIENCE: Question.Just with notation,\nwhat does the hatabove the p [INAUDIBLE]?PROFESSOR: Good.Excellent.So the hat above the\nP is to remind youthat P is on a number.It's an operation.It's a rule for\nacting on functions.We'll talk about that in\ngreat detail next time.But here's what I\nwant to emphasize.This is a state which is equal\nto all others in the sensethat it's a perfectly\nreasonable wave function,but it's more equal because it\nhas a simple interpretation.Right?The probability that I measure\nthe momentum to be h bar kis one, and the\nprobability that Imeasure it to be anything\nelse is 0, correct?But I can always consider a\nstate which is a superposition.Psi is equal to alpha, let's\njust do 1 over 2 e to the ikx.k1 x plus 1 over root\n2 e to the minus ikx.Is this state a state\nwith definite momentum?If I act on this\nstate-- I'll call this isub s-- if I act on this state\nwith the momentum operator,do I get back this\nstate times a constant?No.That's interesting.And so it seems to\nbe that if we havea state with definite momentum\nand we act on it with momentumoperator, we get\nback its momentum.If we have a state\nthat's a superpositionof different momentum and we act\non it with a momentum operator,this gives us h bar k 1,\nthis gives us h bar k2.So it changes\nwhich superpositionwe're talking about.We don't get back\nour same state.So the action of this\noperator on a stateis going to tell us something\nabout whether the state hasdefinite value of the momentum.And these coefficients\nare going to turn outto contain all the information\nabout the probabilityof the system.This is the\nprobability when normsquared that will measure the\nsystem to have momentum k1.And this coefficient\nnorm squared",
