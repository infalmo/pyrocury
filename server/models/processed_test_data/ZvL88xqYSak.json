[{"text": "GILBERT STRANG: Hi.I'm Gilbert Strang.I'm a math professor at MIT.CLEVE MOLER: And\nI'm Cleve Moler.I'm one of the\nfounders of MathWorks,and I'm chief mathematician.Gil and I have\nmade a video seriesabout ordinary\ndifferential equations.GILBERT STRANG: This\ndeveloped reallyfrom my experience of\nthe linear algebra class.It's videotaped and\nshown on OpenCourseWare.And it was my first\ntime to discoverthat millions of people\nwere learning, watching it.And it just seemed\npossible to tacklethe other major undergraduate\ncourses after calculus.The other lead in to\nengineering and science.Differential equations with\nthe two sides of the formulasand the computations.CLEVE MOLER: This is not only\nfor students that are currentlyin school, after calculus.But it's also for\nlifelong learners.People who want to come\nback to this material,maybe after years out of school.We want to help people who\nare using MATLAB to solvedifferential equations.To understand the\nMATLAB ODE suite.To turn the black\nboxes into grey boxes,where you have\nsome understandingof the mathematics\nthat underlies them.GILBERT STRANG: Really,\ndifferential equationsis the expression, the\nmathematical expressionof change.So engineering, finance,\neconomics, life sciences,medical sciences where you're\nseeing things change over time.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.957}, {"text": "Those are modeled by\ndifferential equations.So we want to understand\nwhat does solutionslook like for formulas?And what do they look\nlike for numbers?For actual quantities.CLEVE MOLER: Gil and\nI are matrix guys.Our professional lives have\nbeen involved with matrices.And MATLAB started life\nas Matrix Laboratory.Here we are doing\ndifferential equations.Why is that?That's because matrices are\nfundamental in understandingmodern differential equations.Systems of ordinary\ndifferential equationsare the key to understanding\nmodern applicationsof differential equations.GILBERT STRANG: We\nhope you enjoy it.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.873}]
