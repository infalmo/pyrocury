        "text": "And so that is\nessentially the trade-offwe're going to try\nto do this semester.So the line I like\nis the statisticianGeorge Box said that all models\nare wrong, but some are useful.Now obviously, it doesn't apply\nto models in the hard sciences,but in the social\nsciences, that's true.And basically, I'm\ngoing to write downa set of models like that.Now, with every model I write\ndown, I'm going to try--my goal is to have you\nunderstand it at three levels.The first and most\nimportant levelis the intuitive\nlevel, the levelwhich you sort of understand.I call it \"passing\nthe Mom Test.\"You can go home and explain\nit to your mom at Thanksgivingor at the end of semester.No offense to dads, just\ncalled it \"the Mom Test.\"So basically, that's\nthe intuitive level.You really understand it in a\nway that you could explain it.The second is graphical.We were going to do--\nmost of our modelshere were developed in a\ngraphical framework usingx/y graphs that really in\neconomics, we think deliversa lot of shorthand power.And the third is mathematical.The mathematical is probably\nthe least important,but it's the easiest\nto test you on.So we're going to need to know\nthings mathematically as well.So let's start by considering\nthe supply and demandmodel by using\nthe famous examplebrought up by Adam Smith.Adam Smith is sort of considered\nthe father of economics.If Paul Samuelson is the\nfather of modern economics,Adam Smith is the\nfather of all economics.His 1776 book, The\nWealth of Nationsdid an incredible job\nof actually laying outthe entire core of\nthe economics field--no math, just words,\nbut he just nailed it.And one of his most\nfamous exampleswas the water diamond paradox.He said, think about\nwater and diamonds.He said, start with water.Nothing is more important\nfor life than water.It's the building\nblock of all of life.Even when we look for\nlife on other planets,we always start by\nlooking for water.Now think of diamonds, one\nof the more frivolous things",

        "text": "you can buy, certainly\nirrelevant to leadinga successful or happy or\nproductive life, or any life.Yet for most of us,\nwater's free and diamondsare super expensive.How can this be,\nAdam Smith asked.Well, the answer he posed is\nthat what I first describedwas just demand.That is, we demand\nlots of water.We demand fewer diamonds.But we have to match that\nwith the concept of supply.And the supply of water\nis almost infinite,while the supply of diamonds--\nmaybe not naturally,maybe it's through decisions\nof various businesses--but it's somewhat limited.So basically what\nhe developed iswhat we call the \"supply\nand demand scissors\"--that you can't just think of\nsupply or demand in isolation.You have to put\nthem together if youwant to explain the real world\nphenomena we see, like the factthat water is cheap and\ndiamonds are expensive.So let's just about an example.So there's one graph\nthat was handed outin the back, which\nis, let's talkabout the market for roses.So in the market for roses,\nwe have a demand curveand a supply curve.So what we have here-- this\nis the kind of x/y graphwe're going to look at all\nthroughout the semester.On the x-axis is the\nquantity of roses.On the y-axis is\nthe price of roses.The blue, downward-sloping\nline is the demand curve.Now, what I'm going to do here,\nI'm just giving you a overview.We are going, over the next\nfive or six lectures, diveinto where this demand\ncurve comes from.We'll go to first principles\nand build it back up.But for now, what\nwe know of a demandcurve is it simply\nrepresents the relationshipbetween the price of a good\nand how much people want it.Therefore, we assume\nit is downward sloping.",
