the principles that apply to\ninanimate objects apply toanimate objects.And the solid-state chemistry\numbrella is very broad.If I say solid-state chemistry,\npeople are apt tothink of electronic devices,\ntransistors, what have you.But that extends to\nthe life sciences.I mean we, as human beings,\nare chemical machines.So this is the classical view.Electronic structuring informs\nbonding but then in 3.091bonding informs atomic\narrangement, which tells youeverything.The shape of all things, it's\nall electronic structure.There's nothing more.The difference is that the\nfocus in the chemistrydepartment, their focus\nis the molecule.Whereas in 3.091 I like to\nthink of the focus beingaggregates of molecules,\nnamely solids.Because engineering systems\nare made of solids.If you're

chemistry\nclass and make the connectionsto the world around us, I think\nis most important in the21st century, when problem\nsolving even in the technicaldomain is going to require\nskills that build bridges tothe humanities, arts and\nsocial sciences.And so I like to think of\n3.091 not as a chemistryclass, but rather a\nchemistry-centered class.The majority of students taking\n3.091 at MIT may nevertake another chemistry class.So I ask myself what topics are\ncritical for someone whomight major in electrical\nengineering?Or for someone who might\nmajor in physics?Or what's the chemistry that's\ncritical to an MIT student whomight major in political\nscience or economics?And that informs my\nchoice of topics.And it turns out that that\ndoesn't diminish from theeducation of the student who\nmay choose to major in achemically intensive discipline\nsuch as materialscience, chemical engineering,\nor even chemistry itself.I don't view the presentation\nof the subject matter as alinear

the videos also have\nutility for people that areinterested in specific topics.I mean for example, if somebody\nneeds to knowsomething about x-rays, or the\nuse of x-rays, dropping in tothat
