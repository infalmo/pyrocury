the way to what I think is the current understanding of the structure of time which is that there is very little time in nature and that would be the journey the one-way journey and then there is a

it's a funny question yes one could say why well because we know from general relativity that the switch is a big rock big mass slows down time so math slows down next to it but why I think the right

one and the other so you see that everything you use to think about time disappears when you go to the widest possible situation which is quantum gravity which you keep into account everything we know
