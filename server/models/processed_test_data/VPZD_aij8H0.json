called\nFundamentals of Statistics.And until last spring, it\nwas still called Statisticsfor Applications.It turned out that really, based\non the content, \"Fundamentalsof Statistics\" was a\nmore appropriate title.I'll tell you a\nlittle bit about whatwe're going to be covering\nin class, what this class isabout, what it's not about.I realize there's\nseveral offeringsin statistics on campus.So I want to make sure that\nyou've chosen the right one.And I also understand\nthat for some of you,it's a matter of scheduling.I need to actually\nthrow out a disclaimer.I tend to speak too fast.I'm aware that.Someone in the back, just\ndo like that when youhave no idea what I'm saying.Hopefully, I will repeat\nmyself many times.So if you average\nover time, you'llsee that statistics\nwill tell youthat you will get the right\nmessage that I was actuallytrying to stick to send.All right, so what are\nthe goals of this class?The first one is basically\nto give you an introduction.No one here is expected to\nhave seen statistics before,but as you will see,\nyou are expectedto have seen probability.And usually, you do\nsee some statisticsin a probability course.So I'm sure some of\nyou have some ideas,but I won't expect anything.And we'll be using mathematics.Math class, so there's going\nto be a bunch of equations--not so much real data\nand statistical thinking.We're going to try to provide\ntheoretical guarantees.We have two estimators\nthat are available for me--how theory guides me to choose\nbetween the best of them,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "how certain can I be of my\nguarantees or prediction?It's one thing to\njust bid out a number.It's another thing to put\nsome error bars around.And we'll see how to build\nerror bars, for example.You will have your\nown applications.I'm happy to answer questions\nabout specific applications.But rather than trying\nto tailor applicationsto an entire institute,\nI think we'regoing to work with pretty\nstandard applications,mostly not very serious ones.And hopefully, you'll be able\nto take the main principles backwith you and apply them to\nyour particular problem.What I'm hoping that you will\nget out of this class is thatwhen you have a real-life\nsituation-- and by \"real life\",I mean mostly at MIT, so some\npeople probably would not callthat real life--their goal is to formulate\na statistical problemin mathematical terms.If I want to say,\nis a drug effective,that's not in\nmathematical terms,I have to find out\nwhich measure I wantto have to call it effective.Maybe it's over a\ncertain period of time.So there's a lot of things\nthat you actually need.And I'm not really\ngoing to tell youhow to go from the application\nto the point you need to be.But I will certainly\ndescribe to youwhat point you need to be at\nif you want to start applyingstatistical methodology.Then once you understand\nwhat kind of questionyou want to answer--do I want a yes/no answer,\ndo I want a number,do I want error bars, do\nI want to make predictionsfive years into future, do\nI have side information,or do I not have side\ninformation, all those things--based on that,\nhopefully, you willhave a catalog of\nstatistical methodsthat you're going to be able to\nuse and apply it in the wild.And also, no statistical\nmethod is perfect.Some of the math people have\nagreed upon over the years,and people understand\nthat this is the standard.But I want you to be\nable to understandwhat the limitations are,\nand when you make conclusionsbased on data, that those\nconclusions might be erroneous,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.118}, {"text": "for example.All right, more practically, my\ngoal here is to have you ready.So who has taken, for example,\na machine-learning class here?All right, so many of you,\nactually-- maybe a thirdhave taken a\nmachine-learning class.So statistics has somewhat\nevolved into machinelearning in recent years.And my goal is to\ntake you there.So machine learning has a\nstrong algorithmic component.So maybe some of you have\ntaken a machine-learning classthat displays mostly the\nalgorithmic component.But there's also a\nstatistical component.The machine learns from data.So this is a statistical track.And there are some statistical\nmachine-learning classesthat you can take here.They're offered at the\ngraduate level, I believe.But I want you to be ready to\nbe able to take those classes,having the statistical\nfundamentals to understandwhat you're doing.And then you're going to be able\nto expand to broader and moresophisticated methods.Lectures are here from 11:00 to\n12:30 on Tuesday and Thursday.Victor-Emmanuel will also be--and you can call him Victor--will also be holding\nmandatory recitation.So please go on Stellar\nand pick your recitation.It's either 3:00 to 4:00 or\n4:00 to 5:00 on Wednesdays.And it's going to be mostly\nfocused on problem-solving.They're mandatory in the sense\nthat we're allowed to do this,but they're not going to\ncover entirely new material.But they might cover\nsome techniquesthat might save you some time\nwhen it comes to the

study statistics?Well, if you read the news, you\nwill see a lot of statistics.I mentioned machine learning.It's built on a\nlot of statistics.If I were to teach this\nclass 10 years ago,I would have to explain to you\nthat data collection and makingdecisions based on data was\nsomething that made sense.But now, it's\nalmost in our life.We're used to this idea that\ndata helps in making decisions.And people use data\nto conduct studies.So here, I found a bunch\nof press titles that--I think the key word I was\nlooking for was \"study finds\"--if I want to do this.So I actually did not bother\ndoing it again this year.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "This is all 2016, 2016, 2016.But the key word that I look\nfor is usually \"study find\"--so a new study find--traffic is bad for your health.So we had to wait for 2016\nfor data to tell us that.And there's a bunch of other\nslightly more interesting ones.For example, one that you\nmight find interestingis that this study finds that\nstudents benefit from waitingto declare a major.Now, there's a bunch\nof press titles.There one in the MIT News\nthat finds brain connections,key to reading.And so here, we have an\nidea of what happened there.Some data was collected.Some scientific\nhypothesis was formulated.And then the data was here\nto try to prove or disprovethis scientific hypothesis.That's the usual\nscientific process.And we need to understand how\nthe scientific process goes,because some of those things\nmight be actually questionable.Who is 100% sure that\nstudy finds that students--do you think that you\nbenefit from waitingto declare a major?Right I would be\nskeptical about this.I would be like, I don't want\nto wait to declare a major.So what kind of\nthing can we bring?Well maybe this\nstudy studied peoplethat were different from me.Or maybe the study\nfinds that thisis beneficial for a\nmajority of people.I'm not a majority.I'm just one person.There's a bunch\nof things that weneed to understand what\nthose things actually mean.And we'll see that\nthose are actually notstatements about individuals.They're not even statements\nabout the cohort of peoplethey've actually looked at.They're statements\nabout a parameterof a distribution\nthat was used to modelthe benefit of waiting.So there's a lot of questions.And there are a lot of\nlayers that come into this.And we're going to want to\nunderstand what was going onin there and try to peel it off\nand understand what assumptionshave been put in there.Even though it looks like\na totally legit study,

would be a few that\nwould actually be wrong.If I put 20, there would\ndefinitely be one that's wrong.So you have to see that.Every time you see 20 studies,\none is probably wrong.When there are studies\nabout drug effects,out of a list of 100,\none would be wrong.So we'll see what that means\nand what I mean by that.Of course, not only studies\nthat make discoveriesare actually making\nthe press titles.There's also the press\nthat talks about thingsthat make no sense.I love this first experiment--\nthe salmon experiment.Actually, it was\na grad student whocame to a neuroscience\nposter session,pulled out this\nposter, and explainedthe scientific experiment\nthat he was conducting,which consisted in taking a\npreviously frozen and thawedsalmon, putting it\nin an MRI, showing itpictures of violent images, and\nrecording its brain activity.And he was able to discover a\nfew voxels that were activatedby those violent images.And can somebody tell\nme what happened here?Was the salmon responding\nto the violent activity?Basically, this is just\na statistical fluke.That's just randomness at play.There's so many voxels\nthat are recorded,and there's so\nmany fluctuations.There's always a\nlittle bit of noisewhen you're in those\nthings, that some of them,just by chance, got lit up.And so we need to understand\nhow to correct for that.In this particular\ninstance, we needto have tools that tell us that,\nwell, finding three voxels thatare activated for\nthat many voxelsthat you can find in\nthe salmon's brainis just too small of a number.Maybe we need to find a clump\nof 20 of them, for example.All right, so\nwe're going to havemathematical tools that help us\nfind those particular numbers.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.181},

what's called\np-hacking, whichconsists of violating the basic\nassumptions, in particular,looking at the data,\nand then formulatingyour scientific\nassumption based on data,and then going back to it.Your idea doesn't work.Let's just formulate\nanother one.And if you are doing\nthis, all bets are off.The theory that we're\ngoing to developis actually for a very\nclean use of data, whichmight be a little unpleasant.If you've had an army of\ngraduate students collectinggenomic data for a\nyear, for example,maybe you don't\nwant to say, well,I had one hypothesis\nthat didn't work.Let's throw all the\ndata into the trash.And so we need to find\nways to be able to do this.And there's actually a\ncourse been taught at BU.It's still in its early\nstages, but somethingcalled \"adaptive data\nanalysis\" that will allowyou to do these kind of things.Questions?OK, so of course,\nstatistics is notjust for you to be\nable to read the press.Statistics will probably\nbe used in whatever

sure.And so in particular,\nwhat did they do?Well, they collected\ndata for previous floods.And then they just\nfound a dike thatwas going to cover\nall these things.Now, if you look at the\ndata they probably had,maybe it was scarce.Maybe they had 10 data points.And so for those\ndata points, thenmaybe they wanted to\nsort of interpolatebetween those points, maybe\nextrapolate for the larger one.Based on what they've\nseen, maybe theyhave chances of\nseeing something whichis even larger than everything\nthey've seen before.And that's exactly the goal\nof statistical modeling--being able to extrapolate\nbeyond the data that you have,guessing what you have\nnot seen yet might happen.When you buy insurance\nfor your car,or your apartment,\nor your phone,there is a premium\nthat you have

costs\nthat much to repair,so I'm going to\ncharge them that much.And then I'm going to add\nan extra dollar for my time.That's basically how those\nthings are determined.And so this is using statistics.This is basically where\nstatistics is probablymostly used.I was personally\ntrained as an actuary.And that's me being a\nstatistician at an insurancecompany.Clinical trials-- this is

is a good number?Do they have a table for how\nmany patients were cured?Is there a placebo effect?Do I need a control\ngroup of people thatare actually getting a placebo?It's not clear,\nall these

randomness\nassociated with the lining upof some voxels.Or the fact that as\nfar as the insuranceis concerned whether you're\ngoing to break your iPhoneor not is essentially\na coin toss.Fully, it's biased.But it's a coin toss.From the perspective\nof the statistician,those things are\nactually random events.And we need to tame\nthis randomness,to understand this randomness.Is this going to be\na lot of randomness?Or is it going to be\na little randomness?Is it going to be\nsomething that'slike, out of their people--let's see, for example,\nfor the floods.Were the floods that I\nsaw consistently almostthe same size?It was almost a rounding\nerror, or they're justreally widespread.All these things, we\nneed to understandso we can understand\nhow to build those dikesor how to make decisions\nbased on those data.And we need to understand\nthis randomness.OK, so the associated\nquestions to randomness", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.179}, {"text": "were actually\nhidden in the text.So we talked about\nthe notion of average.Right, so as far as the\ninsurance is concerned,they want to know in average\nwith the probability is.Like, what is your chance of\nactually breaking your iPhone?And that's what came in\nthis notion of fair premium.There's this notion\nof quantifying chance.We don't want to talk\nmaybe only about average,maybe you want to cover say\n99% percent of the floods.So we need to know what is\nthe height of a flood that'shigher than 99% of the floods.But maybe there's 1%\nof them, you know.When doomsday comes,\ndoomsday comes.Right, we're not\ngoing to pay for it.All right, so that's\nmost of the floods.And then there's questions\nof significance, right?So you know I give this\nexample, a second agoabout clinical trials.I give you some numbers.Clearly the drug cured more\npeople than it did not.But does it mean that\nit's significantly good,or was this just by chance.Maybe it's just that these\npeople just recovered.It's like you know\ncuring a common cold.And you feel like,\noh I got cured.But it's really you waited five\ndays and then you got cured.All right, so there's this\nnotion of significance,of variability.All these things\nare actually notionsthat describe randomness\nand quantify randomnessinto simple things.Randomness is a very\ncomplicated beast.But we can summarize it into\nthings that we understand.Just like I am a\ncomplicated object.I'm made of molecules,\nand made of genes,and made of very\ncomplicated things.But I can be summarized as\nmy name, my email address,my height and my weight,\nand maybe for most of you,this is basically enough.You will recognize\nme without havingto do a biopsy on me\nevery time you see me.All right, so, to\nunderstand randomnessyou have to go\nthrough probability.Probability is the\nstudy of randomness.That's what it is.That's what the first sentence\nthat a lecturer in probabilitywill say.And so that's why I need the\npre-requisite, because this",

the timethroughout your\nsemester on probability,randomness was very\nwell understood.When you saw a\nprobability problem, herewas the chance of\nthis happening,here was the chance\nof that happening.Maybe you had more\ncomplicated questionsthat you had some basic\nelements to answer.For example, the probability\nthat I have HBO is this much.And the probability that I watch\nGame of Thrones is that much.And given that I play basketball\nwhat is the probability--you had all these\ncrazy questions,but you were able to build them.But all the basic numbers\nwere given to you.Statistics will be about\nfinding those basic numbers.All right so some examples\nthat you've probably seenwere dice, cards,\nroulette, flipping coins.All of these things\nare things that you'veseen in a probability class.And the reason is\nbecause it's very easyto describe the probability\nof each outcome.For a die we know that\neach face is goingto come with probably 1/6.Now I'm not going to go into\na debate of whether thisis pure randomness or\nthis is determinism.I think as a model\nfor actual randomnessa die is a pretty good\nnumber, flipping a coinis a pretty good model.So those are actually\na good thing.So the questions that you\nwould see, for example,in probabilities\nare the following.I roll one die.Alice gets $1 if the number\nof dots is less than three.Bob gets

of the cohort of 100\npatients to whom you administerthis drug, I will be able\nto conclude that at least 65of them will be cured, on 99.99%\npercent of those data sets.So that's a pretty\naccurate

little mathematical\nkitchen here,and we need to do some modeling.So we need to\nunderstand by modeling--we need understand what\nrandom process we thinkthis data is generating from.So it's going to have\nsome unknown parameters,unlike in probability.", "start": 3480.0, "heat": 0.176}, {"text": "But we need to have just\nbasically everything writtenexcept for the values\nof the parameters.When I said a die is coming\nuniformly with probably 1/6then I need to have, say\nmaybe with probability-- maybeI should say here\nare six numbers,and I need to just\nfill those numbers.So for i equal 1 to\nn, I'm going to defineRi to be the indicator.An indicator is just something\nthat takes value 1 if somethingis true, and 0 if not.So it's an indicator\nthat i-th coupleturns the head to the right.So, Ri, so it's indexed by i.And it's one if the i-th couple\nturns their head to the right,and 0 if it's--well actually, I guess they can\nprobably kiss straight, right?So that would be weird, but\nthey might be able to do this.So let's say not right.Then the estimator of\np, we said, was p hat.It was just the\nratio of two numbers.But really what it is is\nI count, I sum those Ri's.Since I only add those that\ntake value 1, what this is is--this sum here is actually just\ncounting the number of 1's.Which is another way to say it's\ncounting the number of couplesthat are kissing to the right.And here I don't even\nhave to tell you anythingabout the numbers or anything.I can only keep track of--first couple is a 0\nsecond couple is a 1,third couple is 0.The data set-- you can\nactually find it online--is actually a sequence\nof 0's and 1's.Now clearly for the\nquestion that we'reasking about this\nproportion, I don'tneed to keep track of\nall this information.All I need to keep\ntrack of is the numberof 0's and the number of 1's.Those are completely\ninterchangeable.There's no time effect in this.The first couple is no\ndifferent than the 15th couple.So we call this Rn bar.That's going to be a very\nstandard notation that we use.R might be replaced by\nother letters like x--so xn bar, yn bar.And this thing\nessentially means that I", "start": 3600.0, "heat": 0.11}, {"text": "average the R's, or the\nRi's over n of them.And the bar means the average.So I divide by n the\ntotal number of 1's.So here this sum was equal\nto 80 in our example and nwas equal to 124.Now this is an estimator.So an estimator is\ndifferent from an estimate.An estimate is a number.My estimate was 64.5.My estimator is this thing where\nI keep all the variables free.And in particular, I\nkeep those variablesto be random because I'm going\nto think of a random couplekissing left to right as the\noutcome of a random process,just like flipping a coin\nbe getting heads or tails.And so this thing here\nis a random variable, Ri.And this average is, of course,\nan average of random variables.It's itself a random variable.So an estimator is\na random variable.An estimate is the realization\nof a random variable,or, in other words,\nis the value that youget for this random variable\nonce you plug in the numbersthat you've collected.So I can talk about the\naccuracy of an estimator.Accuracy means what?Well, what would we\nwant for an estimator?Maybe we won't want it\nto fluctuate too much.It's a random variable.So I'm talking about the\naccuracy of a random variable.So maybe I don't want\nit to be too volatile.I could have one\nestimator which would be--just throw out 182\ncouples, keep only 2and average those two numbers.That's definitely\na worse estimatorthan keeping all of the 124.So I need to find\na way to say that.And what I'm going\nto be able to sayis that the number is\ngoing to be fluctuating.If I take another\ntwo couples, I'mgoing to be I'm\nprobably going to geta completely different number.But if I take another 124\ncouples two days later,maybe I'm going to have\na very number that'svery close to 64.5%.So that's one way.The other thing we would like\nabout this estimator it'sactually--maybe it's not too\nvolatile-- but alsowe want it to be close to the\nnumber that we're looking for.Here is an estimator.It's a beautiful variable.72%, that's an estimator.", "start": 3720.0, "heat": 0.239}, {"text": "Go out there just do\nyour favorite studyabout drug performance.And then they're going to\ncall you, MIT student

estimator.It's a stupid estimator\nbut it is an estimator.But this is estimator\nis very not volatile.Every time you're going\nto have a new study,even if you change fields,\nit's still going to be 72%.This is beautiful.And the problem is\nthat's probably notvery close to the value you're\nactually trying to estimate.So we need two things.We need are estimated\nto be a random variable.So think in terms of densities.We want the density\nto be pretty narrow.We want this thing\nto have very little--so this is definitely\nbetter than this.But also, we want the number\nthat we're interested in, p,to be very close to this--to be close to the values that\nthis thing is likely to take.If p is here, this is\nnot very good for us.So that's basically the things\nwe're going to be looking at.The first one is\nreferred to as variance.The second one is\nreferred to as bias.Those things come all\nover in statistics.So we need to\nunderstand a model.So here's the model that we have\nfor this particular problem.So we need to make assumptions\non the observationsthat we see.So we said we're going to assume\nthat the random variable--that's not too much\nof a leap of faith.We're just sweeping under\nthe rug everything thingwe don't understand\nabout those couples.And the assumption\nthat we make isthat Ri is a random variable.This one you will\nforget very soon.The second one is that\neach of the Ri's is--so it's a random variable\nthat takes value 0 or 1.Anybody can suggest\nthe distributionfor this random variable?AUDIENCE: Bernoulli.PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: What?AUDIENCE: Bernoulli.PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:\nBernoulli, right?And it's actually beautiful.This is where you have to do\nthe least statistical modeling.A random variable that\ntakes value 0 or 1is always a Bernoulli.", "start": 3840.0, "heat": 0.302}, {"text": "That's the simplest variable\nyou can ever think of.Any variable that takes\nonly two possible valuescan be reduced to a Bernoulli.OK, so this

RIGOLLET:\nYeah, it's same, right?I could have said\np i, but it's p.And that's where I'm\ngoing to be able to startgetting to do some statistics.It's that I'm going to start\nto be able to pull informationacross all my guys.If I assume that\nthey're all pi'scompletely uncoupled\nwith each other.Then I'm in trouble.There's nothing I\ncan actually get.And then I'm going to\nassume that those guys aremutually independent.And most of the time they\nwill just say independent.Meaning that, it's not like all\nthese guys called each otherand it's actually a flash mob.And they were like, let's all\nturn our left side to the left.And then this is\ndefinitely not goingto give you a valid conclusion.So, again. randomness is\na way of modeling lackof information.Here there is a way\nto figure it out.Maybe I could have\nfollowed all those guys,and knew exactly what\nthey were-- maybeI could have looked at\npictures of them in the womband guess how they were\nturning-- by the way that'sone of the conclusions,\nthey're guessingthat we turn our\nhead to the rightbecause our head is turned\nto the right in the womb.So we don't know what goes\non in the kissers minds.And there's, you know,\nphysics, sociology.There's a lot of things\nthat could help us,but it's just too\ncomplicated to keep track of,or too expensive\nfor many instancesNow again, the nicest\npart of this modelingwas the fact that Ri's\ntake only two values, whichmean that this conclusion\nthat they were Bernoulliwas totally free for us.Once we know it's a random\nvariable, it's a Bernoulli.Now they could have\nbeen, as we said,they could have been a\nBernoulli with parameter p i.For each i, I could have\nput a different parameter,but I just don't have\nenough information.What would I have said?I would say, well the first\ncouple turned to the right.", "start": 3960.0, "heat": 0.25}, {"text": "p1 has to be one,\nthat's my best guess.The second couple\nkiss to the left,well, p2 should be 0,\nthat's my best guess.And so basically I\nneed to have to beable to average my information.And the way I do it is by\ncoupling all these guys,pi's to be the same p for all i.OK, does it make sense?Here what I am assuming is that\nmy population is homogeneous.Maybe it's not.Maybe I could actually\nlook at a finer grain,but I'm basically making a\nstatement about a population.And so maybe you kiss to the\nleft, and then you're not--I'm not making a statement\nabout a person individually,I'm making a statement about\nthe overall population.Now independence is\nprobably reasonable,

there's no external\nstimulus that forces peopleto do something different.OK, so-- sorry about that.Since we have about\nless than 10 minutes.Let's do a little bit of\nexercises, is that OK with you?So I just have some\nexercises so we can see whatan exercise going to look like.This is sort of similar to the\nexercises you will see with me.We should do it together, OK?So now we're going to have--I have a test.So that's an exam\nin probability.OK.And I'm going to have 15\nstudents in this test.And hopefully, this\nshould be 15 gradesthat are representative of the\ngrades of all a large class.Right, so if you go you know\n18.600, it's a large class,", "start": 4080.0, "heat": 0.253}, {"text": "there's definitely\nmore than 15 students.And maybe, just by sampling\n15 students at

students and\nthe grades are x1 to x15.Just like we had R1,\nR2, all the way to R124.Those were my Ri's.And so now I have my xi's.And I'm going to\nassume that xi followsa Gaussian or

0.301}, {"text": "What is my estimator for mu?Well, an estimator,\nagain, is something thatdepends on the random variable.All right, so mu is\nthe expectation, right?So a good estimator is\ndefinitely the average score,just like we had the\naverage of the Ri's.Now the xi's no longer need\nto be 0's and 1's, so it's notgoing to boil down to being\na number of ones dividedby the total numbers.Now if I'm looking\nfor an estimate,well, I need to actually\nsum those numbersand divide them by 15.So my estimate is\ngoing to be 1/15.Then I'm going to start\nsumming those numbers--65 plus 72.OK, and I can do\nit, and it's 67.5.This is my estimate.Now if I want to compute\na standard deviation--so let's say estimate for sigma.You've seen that before, right?An estimate for sigma is what?An estimate for sigma, we'll\nsee methods to do this,but sigma squared\nis the variance,or is the expectation, of x\nminus expectation of x squared.And the problem is\nthat I don't knowwhat those expectations are.And so I'm going to do what\n99.9% percent of statistics is.And what is statistics about?What's my motto?Statistics is about replacing\nexpectations with averages.That's what all of\nstatistics is about.There's 300 pages in a purple\nbook called All of Statistics", "start": 4320.0, "heat": 0.242}, {"text": "that tells you this.All right, and then\nyou do something fancy.Maybe you minimize\nsomething after youreplace the expectation.Maybe you need to\nplug in other stuff.But really, every time\nyou see an expectation,you replace it by an average.OK let's do this.So sigma squared\nhat will be what?It's going to be 1 over n,\nsum from i equals 1 to nof xi minus--well, here I need to replace\nmy expectation by an average,which is really this average.I'm going to call\nit mu hat squared.There, you have replaced my\nexpectation with average.OK so the golden thing\nis, take your expectationand replace it with this.Frame it, get a tattoo, I don't\ncare but that's what it is.If you remember one thing from\nthis class, that's what it is.Now you can be fancy, if\nyou look at your calculator,it's going to put an n\nminus 1 here because itwants to be unbiased.And those are things we\nare going to come to.But let's say right\nnow we stick to this.And then when I\nplug in my numbers.I'm going to get an\nestimate for sigma,which is the square\nroot of the estimatoronce I plug in the numbers.And you can check that the\nnumber, you get will be 18.So those are basic things and\nif you've taken any AP statsthis should be completely\nstandard to you.Now I have another
