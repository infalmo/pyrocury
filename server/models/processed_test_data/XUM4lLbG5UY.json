[{"text": " OpenCourseWare is based on a simple but revolutionary idea. That MIT can advance it's  mission by sharing nearly all of it's course content  online, for free. Early 2000 was still the heyday of the dotcom era. MIT was trying to figure out  what MIT should do in this e-learning space. It was before YouTube. It was before Facebook. It was before the web had  completely taken hold. What we're going to do is we're going take all of the  materials we use in our classrooms And we're going to put them  on the web. When OCW was first launched, the focus was on opening  to the world what we teach. For an education institution  like MIT, we have 11,000 students. To reach 200 million people  is really an amazing feat. Every year, I have 60 to  70 bright new faces Through OCW, that number is not 60 or 70 but its thousands or even  millions OCW was the pioneer here of being really a  sharing kind of culture Because we wanted to show  students outside of MIT what kind of place this is and  what kind of students come here", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " Educating engineers so they can  build more bridges Educating musicians so we can  make better musicians. Educating philosophers who can think about the world around us What does it mean to learn something  at the most fundamental level? It makes everybody better. It creates a community of self-learners. It gives access to materials. The promise of OpenCourseWare really comes down to who  you are And what you're trying to  achieve. You don't have to register  for anything; You just go there and you  can pull out the materials. No one is watching you really. You can explore whatever you  want to learn whenever you want to. OCW laid the foundation and it remains integral  to the MIT mission To advance knowledge and  educate students in service to the nation and the world.", "start": 90.0, "heat": 0.1}]
