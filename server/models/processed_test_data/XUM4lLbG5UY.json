[{"text": "OpenCourseWare is based on asimple but revolutionary idea.That MIT can advance it's \nmission by sharing nearlyall of it's course content \nonline, for free.Early 2000 was still the heydayof the dotcom era.MIT was trying to figure out \nwhat MIT should doin this e-learning space.It was before YouTube.It was before Facebook.It was before the web had \ncompletely taken hold.What we're going to do iswe're going take all of the \nmaterials we use in our\nclassroomsAnd we're going to put them \non the web.When OCW was first launched,the focus was on opening \nto the world what we teach.For an education institution \nlike MIT,we have 11,000 students.To reach 200 million people \nis really an amazing feat.Every year, I have 60 to \n70 bright new facesThrough OCW, that number\nis not 60 or 70but its thousands or even \nmillionsOCW was the pioneer hereof being really a \nsharing kind of cultureBecause we wanted to show \nstudents outside of MITwhat kind of place this is and \nwhat kind of students come hereEducating engineers so they can \nbuild more bridgesEducating musicians so we can \nmake better musicians.Educating philosophers who can\nthink about the world around usWhat does it mean to learn something \nat the most fundamental level?It makes everybody better. It creates\na community of self-learners.It gives access to materials.The promise of OpenCourseWarereally comes down to who \nyou areAnd what you're trying to \nachieve.You don't have to register \nfor anything;You just go there and you \ncan pull out the materials.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "No one is watching you really.You can explore whatever you \nwant to learnwhenever you want to.OCW laid the foundationand it remains integral \nto the MIT missionTo advance knowledge and \neducate studentsin service to the nation\nand the world.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}]
