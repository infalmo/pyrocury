all,\nbefore I tell you that,you'll note that I put\nthose two packages up herein the front of the room\nfor this first section.One was bigger than the other.And you guys got the\nsmaller one, right?And you obviously\nknow what that was.The bigger one turns\nout to have been a book.In fact, it's a\nbook that I recentlypublished on hedge funds.Now it turns out that the\nbidding of that second itemwent for $60.The bidding of the item\nthat I sold to this auctionwent for $45.And the fact that it's a\nsmaller package I thinkmakes some sense of why it\nwent for a smaller amount.That shows you the\npower of information,or lack of information, in\nterms of determining values.Yeah, question?AUDIENCE: Yeah, I\nwas just going to askif there was some\ninsider information thatwould up the value\nof that second box?ANDREW LO: Well,\nI don't think so.And one of the reasons that\nI had two different packagesand I showed this entire section\nthe two different packagesis to try to eliminate a bit\nof that private information.I don't believe there was any.If I used the same\ntwo items, then Ithink there would\nhave been a concernthat there might have been\nsome information spill over.So I don't think that was it.In fact, I think what it was\nthe size of the packages,believe it or not.So anybody that tells you that\nsize doesn't matter I thinkis not being realistic.Was there another\nquestion back here?AUDIENCE: I had\nthe same question.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.854}, {"text": "ANDREW LO: OK, yeah?AUDIENCE: How much did\nthe book retail at?ANDREW LO: The book\nretails for $45.Now of course, I\nautographed the book, so--[LAUGHTER]--so that probably\nreduced the resale value.We played-- I took the $60.No tears.Fair is fair.So this class, the individual\nwho bid $45 for that iPoddid very, very well indeed.And the student who\nbid $60 for the bookdidn't do quite as well.But that's the point\nof this example.It's that when you don't\nknow what you're bidding for,when there's literally\nno information,you're obviously not going\nto get it exactly right.But you have to admit that in\nthe grand scheme of things,it's actually not that\nfar off, and not that faroff in a very particular way.I want to, in particular,\ntalk about the iPod.Because we are\nlooking at somethinglike a 70% discount\noff of the retail valueof that for this class.Now I want to comment on\nthat in the context of what'sgoing on today.I want to spend a few minutes,\nbefore we start the lecture,talking about current events.Because finance of course\ninvolves current events.And right now we are going\nthrough an extraordinarilyinteresting set of times.I think that's a Chinese curse--may you live in\ninteresting times.Well, we're going through some\nreally extraordinary times.Because what happened\nover the weekendis something that has\nprobably not happenedsince the Great Depression.What happened over the weekend\nis that the federal governmenttook over two of the largest\ngovernment-sponsored financialentities in the world,\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac.These are two\ngovernment-sponsored entities.They're private\norganizations but theyhave the backing\nof the governmentin some ambiguous sense.And it was ambiguous, up until\nthis weekend, what that meant.What happened was that these\nlarge financial institutions", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.273}, {"text": "were responsible for\npurchasing the mortgagesfrom various different regional\nbanks and lending institutions.And why would they do that?What was their function?Anybody know?Yeah?AUDIENCE: To provide a\nsecondary market for mortgagesso that the banks that\nare the initial lenderscan generate more mortgages\nand make credit more available.ANDREW LO: Exactly.Their goal was to really\nmake credit more availablein the housing market, and\nthe student loan market,and the auto loan market--\nthese consumer finance markets.The purpose of these\ntwo organizationswas to buy up the various\ndifferent obligationsfrom banks and other\nfinancial institutionsso that the banks and\nfinancial institutionscould then go out and lend more\nmoney to more individuals thatwanted these kinds of loans.So the purpose of\nthese two organizationswas really to support and\ngrow these various markets.And it turns out that\nover the last 20 years,these markets have grown\nto epic proportions,tremendous proportions.And now, as the housing\nmarket has turned down,the original lenders that\nmade these obligationsare facing some\nsevere pressures.And that's carried\nthe ripple effectsall the way through\nthe financial system,to the point where these\ntwo organizations literallycould not stand on their own.And if there had been a default\nof these two organizations,there would be some\nmajor repercussions.We're going to talk about\nthat in about four lectures.The material that we're going\nto develop over the next threelectures are going to allow\nus to analyze the situationand really try to\nunderstand what'sgoing on in these markets.But I just wanted to\nalert you to the factthat something really\nbig has happened.You won't understand\nfully what it is.You might read the\nnewspapers, and Iwould encourage you to do\nso, but you won't fullyappreciate the importance of\nit for another three or four", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.145}, {"text": "lectures.But you're going\nto see this eventunfold before your very\neyes this semester.And that will provide\nthe motivationfor developing the tools to\nunderstand what's going on.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Can I ask you\nnow, or can we ask you now,do you think that\nwas the only option,or do you think\nthat was the right--ANDREW LO: Well, that's\na very tough question.In terms of the possibilities\nfor the Secretaryof the Treasury Paulson\nand the government,there aren't too many\nleft in the sensethat these two organizations\nare in a real bind in that theyhave issued lots of securities\nbased upon their activities.And in order to maintain the\nquality of those securities,in order to make good on those\npromises that it has madeto other counter-parties--very important\ncounter-parties I might add,including the governments\nof India, China,and a number of sovereign wealth\nfunds that we depend on to loanus the money that has kept us\nin the style to which we havebecome accustomed\nin this country--in order for us to maintain\nthose kinds of relationships,we have to make good\non our promises.And it's getting harder\nand harder for these twoorganizations to do so.Because while they've\ngot all of these promisesthat they've made,\nthe money that'ssupposed to be coming in order\nto allow them to make goodon these promises is dwindling.And as they've tried to raise\nmore money in the open market,it's become harder and\nharder, because people realizethat they're in trouble, and\nit's very difficult for themto raise that money.In fact, this is related exactly\nto the point about the iPodauction that we\nengaged in last time.Think about how little I\nreceived for that $150 item.I received basically\n$0.30 on the dollar.And why?It's because none of you knew\nwhat was in that package.So now instead of an iPod\nthat's in a wrapped package,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.119}, {"text": "imagine if that wrapped\npackage contained paper issuedby Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.And now I'm going to ask you,\ncan you bid on this paper?Now I don't know whether Freddie\nMac or Fannie Mae will stillbe around in two years, but I'd\nlike you to bid on this paperanyway.And by the way, what you\nget for this piece of paper,I don't really know,\nso it's wrapped up.And you don't know either.You don't know.I don't know.You know I don't know.And I know you know\nI know I don't know.So what's that piece of\npaper going to go for?Well probably less than\n$0.30 on the dollar, right?So what we saw happen in\nthis classroom last timeis exactly what's happened\nin spades to these twolarge organizations.At some point, there has\nto be a day of reckoning.And the Treasury\ndecided rather thanwaiting for that\nday of reckoning--because if that day of\nreckoning came before they wereable to do something, it's very\nhard to put the pieces backtogether.So in my opinion, I think\nthey had very little choicebut to do something right now,\nbefore it got out of hand.And we're going to\ntalk about this again.In fact, we're going to run a\ntrading game where all of youare going to get a chance to\nengage in this kind of trading.It's not exactly the kind\nthat involves credit.But it'll be a\ntrading game, whereyou'll get to see what it's\nlike to be under pressureand to have to make\ndecisions and valuesecurities in real time.And you'll have a much\ndeeper appreciationfor the kind of issues\nthat we're up against.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Sorry, what did\nthe government exactly doto agree to pay for all their--ANDREW LO: Yes,\nso the governmentsaid, OK, you guys, Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac,you can't make good\non your obligationsbecause you've\ngot some problems.So we, the Treasury, will\nstand by all of your claims.AUDIENCE: And the\ngovernment paid that?ANDREW LO: Absolutely.You know how?How can the government pay that?What?AUDIENCE: How, issuing money?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]ANDREW LO: Exactly.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.316}, {"text": "The government-- they\nown the printing presses.So they just-- you want\nto get paid dollars?I'll pay you dollars.Here, how many dollars\nwould you like?I'm going to run it.Here you go!AUDIENCE: So we're probably\ngetting hit with inflation?ANDREW LO: That's the concern.So the concern is that\nif you do this too muchand you do it without anything\nbacking up the pieces of paperyou now print and\ngive to your debtors,then there'll be a problem.Because pretty\nsoon they're goingto realize that\nthe piece of paperisn't really worth as much\nas they thought it was.So inflation could be a problem.It could be a problem.We'll have to see.But right now the paper, the\ndollars that are being printed,are backed by the full faith\nand credit of the US Government.And for the time being,\nthat still means something.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Are all\nthe levels of debtbeing guaranteed with interest?How much of the Fannie\nand Freddie is debt?ANDREW LO: So the\nquestion is, isall of the debt being\nguaranteed or is it just howmuch Freddie and Fannie issued?Well certainly it's\nwhat they've issued.So all of the paper\nthat they've issuedwill be backed by\nthe government.In addition, there\nis some new paperthat they have to issue\nin order to financeadditional mortgages.And the government\nwill back that too.Now this is not for free.It's not just printing presses.That sounds a little too easy.Somebody has to pay for it.The money's got to\ncome from somewhere.Or I'll put it another way.That money that is spent now\nbacking these instrumentscannot be used for other things.So if you believe in\nbalancing your budget asopposed to spending on credit,\nwhich frankly is what got usinto the problems to\nbegin with, then therewill be additional reckoning.People have said that\nthe American taxpayerwill pay for this.Well, that's true.But the question is\nwhich set of taxpayers?Is it us?Is that your children?Is it your children's children?There are a lot of\nintergenerational questions", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.525},

of\nthings, tens of billionsof dollars is nothing.The federal budget is much,\nmuch larger than that,so this is not a big deal.The concern is if this\nspreads and ends upcosting us more because\nof ripple effectsand knock on effects that\nwe don't yet know about,that could be a problem.And that, frankly, is\none of the reasons whythe Fed and the Treasury have\ndecided to step in now to tryto contain this problem.How good they will be at\ndoing that we don't know.Read the newspapers over the\nnext few weeks and let's see.Yep?AUDIENCE: Do you think\nthe common stock basicallyhas to be worth zero\nat this point now?ANDREW LO: Well, it's\nnot worth exactly zero,but it's pretty darn close.And in fact, it's\ncome down quite a lot,I think, over the\nlast couple of years.I don't know what the\npeak of the price was.I haven't looked at it.But I think that\nthe decline has beenon the order of 90%\nto 95% decline of whatthe peak was over the last\ncouple of years, which is--AUDIENCE: This\nmorning it's down 83%.ANDREW LO: Yeah, 83% since when?AUDIENCE: Since yesterday.ANDREW LO: Yeah, that\nwas just a day ago.But I'm talking\nabout since the peak.I think it's come\ndown dramatically.So effectively, the value\nof the shareholders' equityis pretty close to zero.But that's what happens\nin a bankruptcy.And by the way, we're going\nto talk about bankruptcy too.That's going to be a very\nimportant part of whatwe do when we analyze\nfixed income instruments.So we're going to\nget to that shortly.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Has\nthere been anythingabout potentially going\nprivate again down the road?Is that--ANDREW LO: There\nhave been discussionsabout them going private, but\nprivate in a much smaller way.So the discussions\nthat have occurredat the Treasury--\nand we don't knowwhich way things\nare going to end upbecause it's a political process\nas well as an economic one.But there's a feeling that these\ntwo institutions got too big,too quickly and\nthat there wasn'tenough oversight to allow\nthem to be able to fail.In other words,\nthey grew so big,so quickly that\nafter a point they", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.34}, {"text": "were in fact too big to

proposalsthat have been put forward.And we'll talk about those\nalso over the next six or sevenweeks.AUDIENCE: Who did the\ngovernment actuallybought the shares from?Are they federal agencies?Are these private companies?Who--ANDREW LO: So Fannie\nMae and Freddie Macare called GSEs,\nGovernment-Sponsored Entities,which means that they're\nnot a federal agency.But they are backed by\nthe federal governmentin some manner that has been,\nup until now, relatively vague.So they're meant to\nbe private companies.They had a CEO.Both of them had CEOs, who\nwere fired over the weekend.They had separate\nboards of directors.And they pay pretty attractive\nsalaries, private sectorsalaries.But they were related to the\ngovernment in the sense thattheir objectives were to try to\nsupport and expand the housingmarket financing, which was\na government-dictated mandateto this--AUDIENCE: Their main goal\nis not to earn money?It's to bring a secondary\nmarket for mortgages?ANDREW LO: Their main goal was\nto create additional financingto allow the mortgage market to\ngrow and to allow people to buyhomes at reasonable rates.Their secondary goal was to\nmake a profit on top of that.So that's why they're not\njust a government entity,but they have a kind of a quasi\nprivate sector type of mandate.And by the way, they\ndid a great job.They did a great\njob in the sensethat the housing market\nhas grown tremendously.Now you could argue that\nthat was irresponsibleand that created\nall these problemsthat we're facing today.But you talk to somebody who\nhas a subprime mortgage

they\ncouldn't have otherwise had.You talk to them and you tell\nthem that it was a mistake.So it's not at all clear that\nthis is a total disaster.It's unfortunate.And it's a catastrophe\nfrom the pointof view of the current holders\nof various pieces of paperthat are related to\nthese subprime mortgages.But there's a whole\ngroup of people out therethat have benefited from\nthese subprime mortgages.And so you've got to balance\nthe costs and the benefits.And we're not doing\nthat right now.Right now we're just\npanicking because we'reall scared like hell\nthat something reallyis going to break.But there's a positive side\nas well as a negative sideto every story.And so we're going to have to\ntalk about that in a little bitmore detail.But we can't do that unless\nwe have the frameworkto think about it.So that is going to lead\nme to today's lecture.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Just to follow\nup on another question,who were the shareholders in\nFreddie and Fannie Mae system,and did the investment\ngo to zero overnight?ANDREW LO: So there are\ntwo groups of individualsthat are involved.One are the shareholders of\nthe companies themselves.And these are investors.A number of them are pension\nfunds, institutional investors.So therefore, you and\nI, in our 401(k) plans--we might actually\nhave an investmentin one of these organizations\nthrough the plan sponsorthat invests in various\ndifferent entities.So they're a stock that was\ntraded on the exchanges,just like any other stock.That's one group.And those are going to\nlose most of their capital.They're going to lose\ntheir investment,just like when a\nstock goes belly up,the investors of Enron, too bad.They lose everything.They're gone.They knew it.They took the risks and the\nrisks don't always work out,so that's that.The other parties\nthat are involvedare the folks that do\nbusiness with these agencies,the counter-parties that bought\nthe paper that they issued,these IOUs and other complex\ninstruments that Freddie Maeand Freddie Mac issued.Those individuals,\nwe're hoping, will", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.231}, {"text": "be relatively happy about\nthe outcome of the governmentbacking the paper.Because now the paper that\nthey once held and thoughtwas in trouble will have the\nfull faith and credit of the USgovernment behind them.And that is a major concern.Because these counter-parties\nare very, very substantialinvestors.If they decide that\nthis paper is no goodand they start getting\nrid of it wholesale,that will create some really\nsignificant market dislocationand mass panic.And that's what the\nTreasury stepped into stave off this weekend.And hopefully they\nwill have succeeded.In fact, if you\nlook at the data,it looks like they did succeed.But I'm not going to talk about\nthat for another three or fourlectures, because I want to\nshow you exactly how to thinkabout these instruments.And then we're going\nto look at the dataand see whether or\nnot they've actuallydone something significant.And you'll be able to tell.By looking at market\nprices, by lookingat the outcome of auctions\nlike we did last

class.What I want to do\ntoday is to starton lectures two and three,\npresent value relations.And I have to tell\nyou, this is oneof the most interesting\nlectures of the entire course,not because of the\nunderlying material,but rather because of the\nnovelty of the perspectivethat I want to give you\nabout these kinds of issues.This is the very first step\nin changing the way youlook at financial transactions.We're going to\nstart by discussingcashflows and assets.I'm going to define some terms.And I want to change the\nway you think of an asset.And then we're going to\ntalk about the present

patent covers.And that means that at the at\nthe end of the life coverage,you're out.And so I could go and--if Coke would have applied for\na patent however many years ago,it would have expired.I could be making\nCoke right now.But a trade secret is\nsecret forever, as longas you take steps\nto keep it secret.ANDREW LO: Right.AUDIENCE: So they are taking\nthe risk of the secret.ANDREW LO:

thatoccurs given market conditions.An asset is comprised\nof those cashflows.They are one and the same.When you tell me that\nyou have an asset,I immediately\nthink of OK, what'sthe sequence of cashflows?That's all I care about.From the purposes of\nfinancial analysis,that's all that matters.So over the next\nfew weeks, we'regoing to be building up a\ntheory of financial analysis.The basic building blocks\nof that theory are assets.So you could think of\nassets as the moleculesor atoms of a unified\nfield theory of finance.And the protons and electrons--those are the cashflows.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Do the cashflows\nhave to be positive?ANDREW LO: No.They don't have to be\npositive or negative.But they do have\nto be real numbers,so no complex numbers here, OK?Positive or negative--\nthat's what an asset is.Now you might think, well,\ngee, if all the cashflowsare negative then I don't\nreally want that asset.Well that's the\nnature of an asset.Maybe then instead of\nan asset you call it a--AUDIENCE: Liability.ANDREW LO: --liability, exactly.But from my perspective,\ndeveloping this atomic theoryof finance, I'm going to focus\non this as the basic buildingblocks.And I don't care whether\nthey're positive or negativefor the moment.We're going to talk about\ntheir characteristics later.But I just want to agree on a\ndefinition of what an asset is.Question, yeah?",

kinds of assets-- and\nI'm talking really complicatedassets, assets with all\nsorts of options and triggersand various contingencies--the more complicated it\ngets, the more importantthis framework is.Because no matter how\nintimidating the problemyou are faced with,\nthe bottom lineis an asset is a\nsequence of cash flows.It's simple, conceptually.The hard part is figuring out\nwhat those cash

that\n[INAUDIBLE] was asking about.How do you value a\nsequence of cash flows?Because you and\nI-- we might havea very different perspective on\nwhat that cash flow is worth.So for the moment, I'm not\ngoing to answer that question,or rather I'm going to answer\nit with a typical devicethat economists use\nall the time, whichis I'm going to just\ncreate some notationto answer the question.And the notation I'm\ngoing to give you is V,in particular V sub t.That's a function that\ntakes as its inputa sequence of cash\nflows and spitsout a number, which I'm going\nto call the value of the

important to bringin the accounting elements.But for now, let's\nset them aside.So these are actual cashflows\nthat you will receiveat different points in time.And by the way, I want you to\nuse this exact same frameworkfor analyzing\naccounting practices.Because financial\nanalysis can actuallybe used to ask the question,\nare accounting conventionsgood or bad?Some accounting\nconventions are

think.I've simply defined that\nthere is a value operator.Operator means function.You stick in a\nsequence of cashflows.Out pops a number.And when you analyze\nthe value of an asset,I want you to

currency.So 300 pounds converts to\na certain number of yen.And so when you add that\nup, you get 46,050 yen.Or if you want to\nconvert it to pounds,it converts to 300.98\npounds sterling.Those

need to have a set of units.Well it turns out that this\nactual analysis requiresthat we pick a base currency.We pick what's\ncalled a numeraire.A numeraire is a\nunit of account,or a standard, by which\nwe measure everything.So either yen or pounds\nwill work just fine.It doesn't matter which.If you're a British investor,\nyou might care about pounds.If you're a Japanese investor,\nyou might

this\nsequence of cashflows?We've been able to\ntake that problem,that management problem,\nshould you do this or not--we've been able to reduce\nthat to a simple question,do you want $100,000?I think the answer is yes.So that's the management part.Let's do this.Done.The valuation part\nis the hard part.The management\npart, the decision,is easy once you have the\nright numbers in front of you.Second question--\nsuppose a buyerwishes to purchase\nthis project but payfor it two years from now.How much should you\nask for this project?Now the first thing\nyou need to do is what?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].ANDREW LO: Well, that's\nthe second thing.The first thing you need to do--draw a timeline.Draw a timeline so you know\nexactly what's going on.Two years from now.Is that next year or is\nthat two years from today?", "start": 3720.0, "heat": 0.145}, {"text": "So draw a timeline.And you can figure\nout, once you havethe timeline, what the present\nvalues and future values are.So when you work\nout the numbers,you can actually make a decision\nand figure out exactly whatyou ought to charge for that.That's it for the\ntime value of money.But I want to summarize\nby telling youwhat we've learned so far.We've learned that we can\nvalue cashflows-- assets, whichare sequences of cashflows.And the way we value\nthat is by makingsome implicit assumptions.The assumptions are we know\nthe cashflows in advance,so there's no uncertainty\nabout what the cashflows are.Second, we know\nthe exchange rates.And if you don't know\nthem, go get them.Where do you get them?You get them from\nthe marketplace.And finally, there\nare no frictionsin the currency conversions.One thing you\ndidn't ask me aboutis that typically,\nwhen you go abroadand you have to convert\nyour currencies, whatdo you have to do?You have to find somebody\nthat converts it for you.And typically they will charge\nyou a fee for that conversion.I've been talking as if\nthe conversions happenwithout any kind of frictions.That's an assumption\nthat can be tested.So we're going to talk about\nfrictions later in the course.But for now, we're\ngoing to assumethat there are no frictions.Now of course, these\nare all hypotheticals.They're all approximations to\na much more complex reality.But once we understand\nhow the model workswith these simplifying\nassumptions,we can then go back and say, OK,\nlet's make the assumptions morerealistic, and let's see how\nthat affects the implications.So I'm going to first do the\nplain vanilla version of this.And then, after we\nfully understand it,I'm going to come back\nmake this more complex.So until lecture 12--", "start": 3840.0, "heat": 0.127}, {"text": "that's a long ways away--but until lecture 12\nI'm going to assumethat these assumptions hold.And after lecture 12 I'm going\nto go back and systematicallyquestion, and expand and\nrevise, each one of these.So when I told you during\nthe first day of classthat you can't handle the\ntruth, this is what I mean.We're going to\nstart simple and tryto understand the implications\nof these simplisticassumptions.And then, little\nby little, we'regoing to make the assumptions\ncloser to the truth.Now more examples-- once we\nunderstand how this exchangerate mechanism\nworks, we can lookat all sorts of\nother alternativesto calculating value.So in particular, one\nquestion that you might ask,that was asked, is $1 today\nshould be worth more than $1in the future because\nof impatience,because of inflation, because\nof all the reasons we described.But the bottom line\nis supply and demand.More people want money\ntoday than money tomorrow.And so supply and\ndemand, bottom line,dictates that there is this\ndifference between the two.So we can actually\nfigure out whatthat difference is by looking\nat the exchange rates.So in particular, $1 in year 0--if you hold it for a year it'll\nturn into $1 times something,the reverse of the exchange\nrate of $1 in year 1brought back to year 0.But I'm going to write it in\nthis format, 1 plus something.Because remember, when\nwe're going the other way,when we have $1 in\nyear 1 and we wantto figure out what is it\nworth in today's dollars,that's a discount.It's a number less than 1.So if you want to go\nthe opposite direction,if I have $1 today\nand I want to knowhow much is that

at\npounds, you look at yen.And so it's the opposite\nof the same exchange rate.But the way I'm going\nto write it is 1 plus r.Because it'll be greater\nthan 1, typically, so rwill be a number\ntypically greater than 0.What about for two years?I'm going to simply write it\nas 1 plus r quantity squared.And the reason I do\nthat is because I'mthinking about taking\nthat same growth rateand applying it\ntwo years in a row.I could have written 1 plus z.And z then would be the rate of\ngrowth over a two year period.But I like to think in\nterms of annual frequencies.So I'm going to\njust simply assumethat a year is my\nunit of account.And then-- looking at\na one year, two year,three year growth period--I'm going to simply take\npowers of this factor 1 plus r.So $1 in year 0 is going\nto be worth $1 times1 plus r to the\nT-th power in yearT. This r is often called the\nopportunity cost of capital.In fact there are like, five\ndifferent names for this r.It's called the interest rate.It's called the growth rate.It's called the cost of

notation,as opposed to all these\nexchange rates floating around.So remember when\nwe had T periodsand I wanted to figure out\nwhat the value of an assetwas today given T periods.We had to have T exchange rates.That's a pain in the neck\nto carry around T numbers.And moreover, there\nare exchange ratesthat you have to deal with\nbetween dates T plus k and Tplus j.So any two dates,\nyou've got to havean exchange rate between them.So pretty soon the\nnumber of exchangesyou've got to keep in\nyour head is ridiculous.That's why they came\nup with the Euro.They tried to unify some\nof these

0.So 1 over 1 plus r is a\nnumber less than 1, like $0.97to the dollar.So the exchange rate between\nnext year's dollar and today'sdollar is 1 over 1 plus r.What about the exchange\nrate between $1
