[{"text": " let's start by thinking about what economics is and we're gonna start that discussion by thinking about scarcity so if we we think about scarcity the idea behind scarcity is that society has unlimited wants and limited resources so it's impossible for us to produce all of the goods and services that people want to consume and and we'll talk about the fact that that scarcity is going to lead to trade-offs we'll get into that here in just a second but that scarcity also is is what leads to the field of economics so let's talk for a second about what economists do what is the field of economics one of the exercises that I go through with my face-to-face classes is something that I used to I used to when I first started teaching I would send my students on the first day of class before we talked about anything we would meet we talked about the syllabus we talked a little bit about you know what I expected to have the students do in class and what they could expect from me and then we wouldn't really have time to get into the material so I would send them home with this little survey and the survey was just designed to get them to think about some of the stuff that we talked about we're going to talk about in class and then just gather some information about them one of the questions I asked on that first day survey was to try design to try to get them to understand what", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.256}, {"text": " economics was and so I would give them a list of topics and the question that I would have them answer was this one which of the following

of them weren't I said here this isn't a trick question economics doesn't help us understand everything so let me just read some of these to you and and you just think about whether or not this is something that you believed we would talk about in an economics class the first one is the business cycle what I do now is on a first day of class I just read these off and I have the class raise their hand so when I say the business cycle well everybody recognizes that yeah that's an economics thing everybody raises their hand when it was a survey everybody would check that the second one what causes unemployment again people typically raise their hand let me just read some of these others the freezing point of milk what causes inflation how the human heart works how fast people drive on the highway how to maximize profit how much people eat at a buffet how much students study for a test the cause of earthquakes how long a homeowner waits to mow their lawn how long students pay

several more on there and of course what happens is whether its students checking a box on a survey or whether it's students raising their hand in a classroom what happens is hands go up when I say something like how to maximize profit or how the banking system works or why stock prices change everybody's hand goes up but then when I say those ones that are the ones like how long a homeowner waits to mow their lawn hardly anybody would ever raise their hand or how fast people drive on the highway or when a base runner decides to steal a base hardly any hands ever go up and of course if I were to say something like why fish swim in schools yeah and the reason I do this is to illustrate to people that if your hand went up every time I said something like the banking system or I said something like the stock market and your hand didn't go up when I said how long students pay attention during an economics lecture or how fast people", "start": 180.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " drive

do raise your hand on the business cycle that's economics too but that other stuff that most people don't raise their hand on a lot of that other stuff I read that's also economics so let's talk about the definition of economics it's at its most basic level it's the study of human behavior study of human behavior that is what economists do they study human behavior so you should once you understand that you should raise your hand on everything that involves somebody making a decision how long a homeowner waits to mow their lawn that is a human behavior how long Barents wait before checking on a crying baby when a baserunner decides to steal a base there's a lot of economics literature devoted to things like that", "start": 270.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " so I guess the real reason that I do that in a class or the real reason that I would do that by sending home a survey is to get students to realize that economics is not about the financial fate of people that's not it we can talk about that an economist understand that and we will spend some time talking about it but economics is so much more than that economics is about human behavior and if I were to ask a thousand people out there on the street where should you go on a college campus to study human behavior a vast majority of them would say well you should go maybe to the sociology or maybe you should go to psychology and those are places where they are studying human behavior but if you want a study human behavior that's the most basic level the Economics Department is where that's going on we typically talk a lot about business types of situations because there are large numbers of dollars on the line so if you understand human behavior then it's natural to talk about human behavior in the context of large dollars large amounts of dollars being transacted but at its most basic level it's the study of human behavior turns out though that it's actually more general than that there's some economics literature where they study the behavior of animals so if you look at say a rat", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " in a cage and you think about how much food that rat eats let's suppose that at the end of the cage there's a device there where the rat presses a lever and if they press the lever once a piece of food falls out and the rat eats it and if they press the lever again another piece of food falls out if we were to look at the amount of food that the rat consumes in a day and then change the price of food for the rat if I were to ask most people out there in the on the street what's gonna happen if we change the price of food most people will say it won't matter the rat won't respond to that because it's just a rat I mean they have nothing to do in this cage all day except press the lever and eat food so they're just gonna eat the same amount of food turns out that's not at all what happens rats respond to prices the same way we do the price of something goes up all other things equal prices something goes up we want to buy less of it if you raise the price of food for the rat it will consume less food raising the price of food looks like just making it press the bar more than one time for a piece of food if you raise the price it will consume less food so some economic literature's devoted to just the study of behavior whether it's a human or whether it's

lots and lots of sub disciplines within the general field of economics the kind of big distinction is going to be micro economics versus macro economics in macro you're looking at the big picture how an economy functions in micro you're looking at the small picture how individual behavior or how an individual business might make its decisions but within those two main categories we've got lots of subdivisions and so there are all kinds of different subfields within economics there's labor economics and international economics and public choice theory and game theory and econometrics and a

there that that's one of those things that you might think well that just kind of goes without saying but it doesn't what the idea here is that to get something you want you're always going to have to give up something else you want so we could be thinking about how you choose to spend your household income so you have some income that you've earned from working and then you've got to decide whether you should spend it on pizzas or or textbooks for a class or whether you should spend it going to a movie or all of the other things that you could spend that money on and if you spend money on one thing that's money that can't be spent on something else so there's a trade-off there we could think about so let's just put here maybe your income we could think about your time how do you

friends or watching TV or whatever you might be doing with your time so there are trade-offs that you face in terms of income time lots of things opportunities it's also the case that society faces trade-offs so if we think about a trade-off that society faces society faces the trade-off between production of consumer goods and services and national defense sometimes we refer to that as the guns versus butter trade-off we like to have both of them we like to have national defense and we like to have consumer goods and services and and it'd be great if we could just have more of everything but we can't any resources that we devote to national defense are resources that can't be devoted to building new roads or scholarships to go to school things like that there's also a trade-off that society faces between efficiency and equity efficiency has to do with the size of the economic pie equity has to do with with how fairly the pie is divided and there's a trade-off there unfortunately

but we have to recognize the reality that the more of that we do the less of it the less of everything there is to go around ok so society faces trade-offs just like we individually face trade-offs let's think about the second principle and that is that the cost of something is what you give up to get it the cost of something it's what you give up to get it let's just say what you give up this word cost what you see what you'll learn quickly in this class and in any economics class is that I'm going to use this word cost a little more generally than you've used it in the past so typically

give up to get it it could be that you had to give up two dollars plus the effort to walk over to the place to actually get it so I'm going to use this word cost more generally actually economists typically used the phrase opportunity cost to remind ourselves that it's more than just the dollars that you have to give up the dollar certainly are part of the cost of something we'll talk more about that here a little bit but there's there's other things that you're giving up and we have to include whatever it is that you've given up so if we think about opportunity cost let's think about the opportunity cost of of say going to class if we were to talk about the opportunity cost of going to class then there's no dollars transacted in going to class when you walk into a classroom",

opportunity cost of going to class what you're actually giving up is the time that it takes you to go to class to sit there and to get back to your apartment or your dorm room so it's tempting at first to think that the opportunity cost is that you're giving up your time but we have to be careful about that because it's not the number of minutes that is actually going to be the cost it's whatever you would have done in those minutes it's whatever your next best alternative use of your time would be so it could be that if you weren't going to class you would spend that time sleeping so by going to class what you're giving up is sleeping or it could be that your next best use of time maybe you would be playing video and so if you weren't a class that's what you're giving up or it could be that maybe your parents are in town and they're getting ready to leave today and they call you up in the morning and they say hey we'd like to take you out to lunch and you say oh you know

because again it's not the number of minutes let's think about something else let's say buying something so if we were to think about the opportunity cost of purchasing something let's suppose you buy a pizza suppose that it you call up the pizza place and they say oh it's ten dollars and so you pay with your credit card and and then they deliver the pizza let's think about the cost the opportunity cost associated with that in this case there is a dollar component because you will have paid ten dollars so it's tempting to say that the opportunity cost that part of it is ten dollars but we have to remind ourselves that it's whatever you would have spent the ten dollars on that's what you really give up it's not the ten dollars itself it's the other goods and services that you could have bought with the ten dollars so there's that there's the other goods and services that you have to give up and then there's a little bit of effort right you had to make a phone call and maybe when they

going to be including the fact that you have to pay dollars that is part of the cost with a lot of different things but there are lots of different behaviors that you engage in like going to class where there's not a dollar transaction but there's still a cost and it's it's whatever your next best alternative is let's talk about for just a second one common problem that I see students make one mistake is that sometimes let's say we go back to this going to class sometimes it's tempting for students to say well if I didn't go to class then I could be watching TV and I could be another thing I could be doing is playing video games or I could be hanging out with my friends or I could be I don't know going for a walk and you can list an infinite number of things that you could be doing if you weren't going to class and so sometimes students say well the what I'm giving up is infinite there's an infinite number of things that I could be doing we're always going to think about just your next best alternative okay so the cost", "start": 1170.0, "heat": 0.111}, {"text": " of something is what you give up and that leads us to this kind of a basic idea in economics that you've probably heard before and that is that there's no such thing as a free lunch there there is nothing that is truly free everything has a cost if you divide defining the cost as just the dollars then sometimes you might be able to say this is free because I didn't have to give up dollars but we're not going to be defining it as just dollars it's whatever you give up to get it and in that case there is no such thing as a free lunch there is always going to be a cost associated with everything let's talk about principle number three principle number three is going to be that people respond to incentives

see the incentives that change so you may not be able to understand why somebody engaged in a particular type of behavior but you can rest assured that all behavior is a response to incentives let's talk about some different types of incentives we can think about what we're going to call economic incentives an economic incentive is typically what we mean if we're talking about say dollars or points in a class so if I were to give a test the reason I put points on it is because I want to give you an incentive to try to earn those points to get a good grade in the class and so if you are studying in an attempt to do well on the test so that you can earn more points that's easy to understand why you're responding to that incentive or if there's some dollars on the line if I were to offer you a certain number of dollars to do some work for me and you did it it would be easy to understand why you did that work because of the dollar incentive that I gave to you so economic incentives a lot of times really easy to see and it's easy to understand why people respond to those but there are other types of incentives that are not that easy to see so if we think about another type we can talk about social incentives social", "start": 1350.0, "heat": 0.137}, {"text": " incentives are created by society so these are things like the desire for acceptance or the avoidance of

all responding to more of our behaviors driven by social incentives then it's driven by economic incentives and then we could also think about moral incentives a lot of your behavior is driven by your sense of what's right and what's wrong and so these two types of incentives are much harder to see than economic incentives so what we can rest assured that behavior is driven by incentives but that doesn't make it easy to understand all behavior because there are incentives that are very challenging for us to observe in the real world it's also the case and this is important that that not

aren't that interested in studying that much or maybe they don't even realize they need to study that much but I will observe some students not work very hard and therefore not earn very many points on the test and not end up doing that well in the class and and yet I've I've provided the exact same incentive to all of the students so not everyone responds to the same incentive the same way let's talk about the fact that it's very easy to forget that people respond to incentives the way that I typically illustrate this is to talk about our consumption of oil let me give you some numbers here if we were to look at the amount of oil that we've got I'm gonna give you a very big number 531 with nine zeros after it that's the number of barrels of crude oil in reserve and this", "start":

you've actually got to pay to store it and it turns out that it's already being stored in the ground so 531 what is that billion barrels of crude oil in reserve in the world we could also think about

let's just pretend like that's all there is there's oil we haven't found yet but let's pretend like that's the maximum amount we've got and then this is the amount we use every year if you look at how numbers like that get used by politicians and by activists what you see is that what they'll do is they'll take this number and they'll divide it by that number and then they'll come up with a number

the action the marginal cost is the additional cost that you incur if you continue to take the action so a decision-maker takes an action if and only if the marginal benefit is bigger than the marginal cost that's really really really important now that's like a 2-star important maybe even three stars take an action if and only if the marginal benefit is bigger than the marginal cost now let's think about what that means in terms of study the marginal benefit of continuing to study is going to be the additional not knowledge that you gain from studying the change in benefit okay the marginal cost is going to be the additional cost that you incur so if you continue to study you're going to be giving up whatever your next best alternative is but remember we've said that that your friends aren't doing anything and the marginal cost is low so if the marginal cost is down here and the marginal benefit is right up here then you continue to study and then let's suppose that there's a knock on the door and it's one of your friends and and it's a friend that you like and they say hey you know what we're gonna go out and we're gonna do something you want to go with us now the incentives have changed and people are going to respond to that change in incentives", "start": 2340.0, "heat": 0.431}, {"text": " that doesn't mean you quit studying what we have to think about is what's changed well the benefit of continuing to study at the margin hasn't changed but the cost has and if these are friends that you like the marginal cost has gone up does that mean you quit study well it depends on how much the marginal cost has gone up if it goes up but it's still smaller than the marginal benefit then you continue to study but if it goes up and now it's bigger than the marginal benefit well then you might say you know what I'm gonna close my book I'm gonna go out with you guys so what's important is to focus on the marginal benefit and the marginal cost it doesn't matter how big one by itself is or how small it is what matters is the relative size let's change it a little bit let's suppose that you're sitting there studying and you're not giving up very much at all so the marginal cost is relatively low and let's suppose that you are really really learning the material well you're having breakthroughs that are unlike anything you've ever experienced before so the marginal benefit is huge tremendously big and so when that friend knocks it doesn't matter what they're doing you're you're gonna continue to study because you're starting to the clouds are parting in your brain and you're", "start": 2430.0, "heat": 0.291}, {"text": " starting to understand things like you never before is there any circumstance under which you would ever interrupt that where the marginal benefit is tremendously high is there any circumstance under which you would stop that and the answer is of course of course it doesn't matter if the marginal benefit is just sky-high if all of a sudden the marginal cost is even higher then you quit so if you're sitting there studying and and the clouds are parting and then all of a sudden somebody walks in through the door and sticks points a gun at you and says either stop studying or you're gonna die then clearly the marginal cost of continuing to study is now huge right you die so the key here is not how big marginal benefit is or how big marginal cost is it's how big they are relative to each other they could both be way up here they can both be way down here but what matters is how do they compare to each other so that's what it means to think at the margin okay you're thinking about the marginal benefit the additional benefit the additional cost and you're going to respond to those the the comparison of those you're going to respond to those and incrementally adjust your plan of action let's think about the next principle we'll call it number five and that is that trade can make

trade between two countries let's start by saying that noticing that it doesn't say that trade always makes everyone better off that's not what what it says what it says is that trade can make everyone better often will actually spend a whole future video talking about this very principle why do people voluntarily engage with trade with each other let's think for a second about international trade it's not uncommon for people to be skeptical of international trade because they think that the world is a zero-sum game and a zero-sum game is a game where if I win you have to lose so poker is a zero-sum game if we all walk into the room with $100 and I walk out with 300 dollars then that means some other people had to walk out with less than they walked in with that's a zero-sum game any gains by me are losses by somebody else turns out that trade is not that way voluntary trade between people or between countries is not a zero-sum game it's what we would call a positive sum", "start": 2610.0, "heat": 0.283}, {"text": " game that means that we can all walk away and have gained from it so trade can make everyone better off an easy way to think about why this has to be true is to think about what would happen if you didn't trade with with other people so let's suppose that you decide you know what I'm gonna trade less if you traded less then that means that you're not going to be buying stuff from other countries let's suppose that you you buy only stuff made in the u.s. you buy American well then that's you won't have reasons for wanting to do that but that's going to close off several options to you for buying goods and services from people in other countries if buying American is good then how about if you just buy Missouri well think about all of the things you won't be able to buy because they're not produced here or if if by Mazar is good then by Warrensburg clearly you start to realize that if i only buy the less i trade with people the more stuff i have to produce myself because it's not being produced in my limited circle that i'm going to trade with and so clearly the more stuff you have to do for yourself the less time that leads for other things so trade can make everyone better off the absence of trade makes people worse off we'll talk about that again in an upcoming video let's talk about", "start": 2700.0, "heat":

free market I don't mean a situation where sellers can do whatever they want sometimes people define a free market as the complete absence of any regulation on sellers and that's not at all how economists mean that phrase what we mean is that sellers are free to sell what they want within the bounds of the law and consumers are free to buy what they want within the bounds of the law so you can't you can't lie to customers about the quality of your product and you can't lie to them about other characteristics of the product and as a consumer you can't buy things that are deemed illegal

in this class the key characteristic of those two ways of organizing economic activity is that the means of production is owned by the government so if you look at sociology or excuse me if you look at communism or socialism both of those are situations where the government controls the means of production the businesses what's being produced it's a basic principle of economics that capitalism

have things that we call an externality an externality is when one person's behavior imposes a cost on somebody else so it's a type of market failure in those cases sometimes the government can

too much money so let's just put let's just write money here when the government prints too much money drives prices up causes inflation we'll spend time talking about that so that's kind of a basic
