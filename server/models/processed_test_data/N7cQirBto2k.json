of your friendsand and it's a friend that you like andthey say hey you know what we're gonnago out and we're gonna do something youwant to go with us now the incentiveshave changed and people are going torespond to that change in incentivesthat doesn't mean you quit studying whatwe have to think about is what's changedwell the benefit of continuing to studyat the margin hasn't changed but thecost has and if these are friends thatyou like the marginal cost has gone updoes that mean you quit study well itdepends on how much the marginal costhas gone up if it goes up but it's stillsmaller
