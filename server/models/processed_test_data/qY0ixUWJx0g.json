[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Hello and\nwelcome to thehelp session on pedigrees.Today, we will be working\nout a problem together.If you have not yet had a chance\nto work it on your own,please do so now, and\nreturn to this videowhen you are done.Now that you've had a chance to\nlook at this problem, let'swork it out together.The first part of this question\nasks, what is themode of inheritance that is\nobserved in this pedigree?So, we know that there are two\nmain types of modes ofinheritance.It can either be dominant\nor recessive.And from there it can either\nbe autosomal or X-linked.If a disease follows a dominant\ninheritance pattern,generally, it must be present\nin every generation.So here we notice that the\ndisease is present in thefirst generation, but it's not\npresent in anyone in thesecond generation.However, then it reappears\nin the third generation.This suggests that the\ndisease is recessive.So now, do we think\nthis disease isautosomal or is it X-linked?So we look at the pedigree\nagain, and upon closerinspection, we notice\nthat the affectedindividuals are only males.This is a key characteristic\nof anX-linked recessive disease.However, we're also given more\ninformation that tells us thatthis individual here does not\ncarry an allele associatedwith the affected phenotype.This rules out the possibility\nthat this disease could be an", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "autosomal recessive disease.Thus, the most likely mode ofinheritance is X-linked recessive.Great, so moving on to the\nsecond part of this problem,we are asked to determine the\ngenotypes of individualsnumber one and number three.So, if we look at this pedigree,\nwe know individualone is female and not affected\nby the disease.Female individuals contain two\nX chromosomes, and since sheis not affected she must contain\nat least one large R.So we'll call the allele\nassociated with thedisease small r.We do not yet know what her\nsecond X chromosome could be.It could be either another\nlarge R or itcould be a small r.And she also would still not\nbe affected by the disease.This male right here is affected\nby the disease.So he must have an\nX with a small r.Remember that males have one\nX chromosome and one Ychromosome.So now, making our way down to\nindividual number three.Individual number three does\nnot have the disease and isfemale, so again, must have\ntwo X chromosomes.One of the X chromosomes must\ncome from her father and theother from her mother.The only X chromosome that her\nfather can pass along to heris X small r.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "In order for her to not be\naffected with the disease, herother X chromosome must\nhave a large R.She was able to get this\ngenotype with her motherhaving either of these\ntwo genotypes.To make sure that both of these\ngenotypes are possiblefor this mother, we need to\nexamine her other children.Her son here is unaffected.So his genotype must have been\nX large R, Y. It's possiblefor him to get this genotype\nwhen the mother has either ofthese two genotypes.Similarly, this daughter could\nbe unaffected just as thisdaughter was unaffected.So the mother can have either\nof these two genotypes.And we're unable to rule\nout one of them.So let me just write up\nthe answer over here.All right, so far, so good.Next, we're asked to calculate\nthe probability thatindividual A is affected.Individual A is over here at\nthe bottom of the pedigree.In order for individual A to be\naffected, she must have thefollowing genotype.The only way for her to get two\nlittle r's is for her toget one from her father and\none from her mother.We know this is possible because\nher father is affectedwith the following genotype\nof Y, X small r.Her mother is not affected.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So for her to get this small\nr, her mother must be acarrier for the disease,\nand have the genotype Xlarge R, X small r.So in order to determine the\nprobability that A is affectedwith both X small r's, we must\nalso know the probability thather mother was a carrier\nfor the disease.Let's call her mother\nindividual C.So, we know the genotypes\nof her parents.Her mother was a carrier.And her father did not have the\ndisease, so his genotypewas Y with X large R. So to\ncalculate the probability thatindividual C is a carrier for\nthe disease, let's go backover here and draw out\na Punnett square.On one side, we're going to\nwrite the genotype of herfather, which was Y because\nhe's a male.And then, he was not affected\nby the disease, so it was Xwith a large R. Her mother\nwas a carrier.So she had one copy that was X\nlarge R, and one copy that wasx little r.So next, we want to know\nthe probabilitythat she was a carrier.The only ways you can get\nfemales is by looking at thistop row here.So, for now, we're going to\nignore the bottom row.Of the two possible ways to\ngenerate a female, only one ofthem is a carrier.So there's a 50% chance that\na female will be a carrier.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.16}, {"text": "So this is a 50% chance that\nindividual C is a carrier,which we will denote with this\nhalf filled in circle.All right, so now that we know\nthe probability that C was acarrier, we need to know the\nprobability that her progeny,A, was affected with\nthe disease.Again, looking back over here,\nher progeny needs to inheritthe X small r from the\nmother and the Xsmall r from the father.So, once again, we can draw\na Punnett square to betterunderstand this.Individual A's father\nwas indeedaffected by the disease.So his genotype was X small r\nand Y. Her mother, we justcalculated the probability of\nher being a carrier, so she isX large R, X small r.Now, we're looking at individual\nA, who is a female,so again, we can ignore\nthe bottom row becausethis will be males.Here are the progeny\nwhich are female.Of the two possibilities, only\nthe one on the right, X smallr, X small r is affected\nby the disease.So there is a 50% chance that\nA will be affected by thedisease given that her mother\nis a carrier of the disease.Now to finish up this part of\nthe problem, we need tomultiply these two probabilities\ntogether becausewe're looking at the probability\nthat C is acarrier, and the probability\nthat A is", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.171}, {"text": "affected with the disease.This gives us our answer\nof one fourth.All right, so, moving on to the\nlast part of the problem.We need to calculate the\nprobability that B is affectedwith the disease.So this isn't that hard now that\nwe've drawn out all ofthese Punnett squares already.So, let's take a look back at\nour pedigree over here.If B is going to be affected\nwith the disease, he must havethe genotype Y, X\nwith a small r.He gets the Y from his father\nand he must get this X with asmall r from his mother.So again, we need the mother,\nC, to be a carrier.So let's go back to our Punnett\nsquares over here.We know that there is\na 50% chance thatindividual C is a carrier.Now we need to look at\nindividual B being affected bythe disease.So we can go ahead and fill\nin the bottom part of thisPunnett square.So of these two males, that are\npossible, only one of themis affected with the disease.So again, there is a 50%\nprobability that that childwill be affected with\nthe disease.Again, we are going\nto multiply theseprobabilities together.So the probability that the\nmother is a carrier, and thatthe son is affected with the\ndisease, gives us one quarter.That concludes our problem\non pedigrees.Thank you for joining us.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.264}]
