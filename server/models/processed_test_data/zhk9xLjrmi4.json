The kinetic energy\nminus the potential energyof the entire system.Total kinetic and total\npotential energy expressions.Then we have some quantities.qj's.These are defined as\nthe generalized forces.Generalized coordinates,\nI should say.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And the capital Q sub j's\nare the generalized forces.And the Lagrange\nequation says that dby dt the time derivative of\nthe partial of l with respectto the qj dots, the velocities,\nminus the partial derivativeof l with respect to the\ngeneralized displacementsequals the generalized forces.And for a typical system,\nyou'll have a number of degreesof freedom, like say three.And if you have three\ndegrees of freedom,you need three\nequations of motion.And so the j's will go from\none to three in that case.So the j's here refer\nto an [? index ?]that gives you the number\nof equations that you need.So you do this calculation\nfor coordinate one,again for coordinate two,\nagain for coordinate three,and you get then three\nequations of motion.OKSo this is a little obscure.Let's just plug in.For l equals t minus v.\nAnd just put it in hereand see what happens.You get d by dt of the\npartial of t with respect", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.286}, {"text": "to qj dot minus d by\ndt of the partial of vwith respect to qj dot plus--\nI'll organize it this way.Minus the partial\nof t with

a\nfunction of time or-- anybodyremember?Velocity.So if the potential\nenergy is nota function of time nor velocity,\nwhat will happen to this term?This goes away.So this is 0 for\nmechanical systems.If you start getting\ninto electrons movingand magnetic fields, then you\nstart have a potential energiesinvolving velocities.But for mechanical\nsystems, this term's 0.And I think the bookkeeping.So this is the form of\na Lagrange equationsthat I write down when\nI'm doing problems.I don't write this.Mathematicians like elegance.And this comes down to this\nis beautifully elegant simplelooking formula.But I'm an engineer\nand I like it to beefficient and practical useful.This is the practical useful\nform of Lagrange equations.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.531}, {"text": "So you just use what you need.Kinetic energy here,\nkinetic energy there,potential energy there.And I number these.There's a lot of\nbookkeeping in Lagrange.So I call it term one, term\ntwo, term three,

equations you're after.OK.So now we need to\ntalk a little bitabout what we mean by\ngeneralized coordinates.qj.What's this word\ngeneralized mean?Generalized just means it\ndoesn't have to be Cartesian.Not necessarily\nCartesian as in xyz.You got a lot of liberty and\nhow you choose coordinates.Not necessarily Cartesian.Not even inertial.They do have to satisfy\ncertain requirements.The

to that in a minute.So you need to understand what\nit means to be independent,complete, and holonomic.So what do we mean\nby independent?So if you have a multiple\ndegree of freedom systemand you fix all but\none of the coordinates,say the system can't move in\nall but one of its coordinates.That last degree\nof freedom stillhas to have a complete\nrange of motion.So if you have a double pendulum\nand you grab the first mask,the second mask can still move.It takes two angles to\ndefine your double pendulum.So independent.When you fix all\nbut one coordinate,still have a

bring one today.And I need to pick some\ncoordinates to describe this.And we'll use some\nCartesian coordinates.Here's an x and a y.And here's particle one.And I could choose to describe\nthis system

coordinates do I\nhave to describe the system?How many have I used?Four, right?How many degrees of freedom\ndo you think this problem has?Two.So there's something already\na little out of whack here.But the point is these aren't\nindependent, you'll find.You just do a test.You'll find that these\naren't independent.If I fix x1 and x2,\nsystems doesn't move.If I say this is going to be one\nand this has got to be three,this system is now frozen.So this system of core\ncoordinates is not independent.What did we say?Independent.When you fix all\nbut one coordinate,you still have continuous range\nof movement of the final one.I could fix only\njust two of theseand I've frozen the system.I don't even have to go to\nthe extent of fixing three.I'm assuming the strings\nare of fixed length.You can't change\nthe string length.So this is not a very good\nchoice of coordinates.And we had a hint\nthat it might not be,because it's more\nthan we ought to use.We only really need two.So and then if we choose\nthese angles, v1 and v2,let's do the test with that.Are those independent?", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.658}, {"text": "So those are the\ncoordinates of the system.If you

pair v1\nand v2 in this exampleare both independent\nand complete.Now, the third requirement is\na thing called holonomicity.And what it means\nto be holonomicis that the system, the number\nof degrees of freedom requiredis equal to the\nnumber of coordinatesrequired to completely\ndescribe the motion.Now, every example we've ever\ndone so far in this classsatisfies that.We picked v1 and v2

about g.Even though g is moving.That accounts for that energy.Because it's only a\nfunction of theta dot.It's not a function\nof that position x.This term is going to account\nfor the kinetic

static equilibrium all\ntime derivative is 0.So this would be\n0, this would be 0.You know its static\nequilibrium hangs down,so cosine theta is 1.Static you don't have any\ntime dependent
