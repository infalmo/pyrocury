We will talk a lot about what we really mean by generalized coordinates and generalized forces and then do a number of application examples. There's a set of notes on Stellar on the Lagrange method. It's about 10 pages long and I highly recommend you read them. They're not somehow up with the notes associated with lecture notes or [INAUDIBLE] way down at the bottom. So you have to scroll all the way down in the Stellar website to find them. Our second quiz is November 8. That's a week from next Tuesday. OK. Pretty much same format as the first one. OK. So let's talk about how to use Lagrange equations.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " So I defined what's called the Lagrangian last time. t minus v. The kinetic energy minus the potential energy of the entire system. Total kinetic and total potential energy expressions. Then we have some quantities. qj's. These are defined as the generalized forces. Generalized coordinates, I should say. And the capital Q sub j's are the generalized forces. And the Lagrange equation says that d by dt the time derivative of the partial of l with respect to the qj dots, the velocities, minus the partial derivative of l with respect to the generalized displacements equals the generalized forces. And for a typical system, you'll have a number of degrees", "start": 90.0, "heat": 0.286}, {"text": " of freedom, like say three. And if you have three degrees of freedom, you need three equations of motion. And so the j's will go from one to three in that case. So the j's here refer to an [? index ?] that gives you the number of equations that you need. So you do this calculation for coordinate one, again for coordinate two, again for coordinate three, and you get then three equations of motion. OK So this is a little obscure. Let's just plug in. For l equals t minus v. And just put it in here and see what happens. You get d by dt of the partial of t with respect to qj dot minus d by dt of the partial of v with respect to qj dot plus-- I'll organize it this way.", "start": 180.0, "heat": 0.531}, {"text": " Minus the partial of t with respect to qj plus the partial of v with respect to qj equals capital Qj. Now when we first talked about potential energy a few days ago, we said that for mechanical systems, the potential energy is not a function of time or-- anybody remember? Velocity. So if the potential energy is not a function of time nor velocity, what will happen to this term? This goes away. So this is 0 for mechanical systems. If you start getting into electrons moving and magnetic fields, then you start have a potential energies involving velocities. But for mechanical systems, this term's 0. And I think the bookkeeping. So this is the form of a Lagrange equations that I write down when I'm doing problems. I don't write this. Mathematicians like elegance. And this comes down to this is beautifully elegant simple looking formula. But I'm an engineer and I like it to be efficient and practical useful. This is the practical useful form of Lagrange equations.", "start": 270.0, "heat": 0.555}, {"text": " So you just use what you need. Kinetic energy here, kinetic energy there, potential energy there. And I number these. There's a lot of bookkeeping in Lagrange. So I call it term one, term two, term three, and term four. Because you have to grind through this quite a few times. And so when you do, basically you take one of the results of 1 plus 2 plus 3 equals 4. And you do that j times to get the equations you're after. OK. So now we need to talk a little bit about what we mean by generalized coordinates. qj. What's this word generalized mean? Generalized just means it doesn't have to be Cartesian. Not necessarily Cartesian as in xyz. You got a lot of liberty and how you choose coordinates.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.271}, {"text": " Not necessarily Cartesian. Not even inertial. They do have to satisfy certain requirements. The coordinates, they must be what we call independent. They must be complete. So it must be independent and complete and the system must be holonomic. I'll get to that in a minute. So you need to understand what it means to be independent, complete, and holonomic.", "start": 450.0, "heat": 0.436}, {"text": " So what do we mean by independent? So if you have a multiple degree of freedom system and you fix all but one of the coordinates, say the system can't move in all but one of its coordinates. That last degree of freedom still has to have a complete range of motion. So if you have a double pendulum and you grab the first mask, the second mask can still move. It takes two angles to define your double pendulum. So independent. When you fix all but one coordinate, still have a continuous range of movement essentially in the free coordinate. And that's independent. And we'll do this by example mostly.", "start": 540.0, "heat": 0.658}, {"text": " And complete. The complete really means it's capable of locating all parts of the system at all times. So let's look at a system here. It's a double pendulum. It's a simple one just made out of two particles and strings. I didn't bring one today. And I need to pick some coordinates to describe this. And we'll use some Cartesian coordinates. Here's an x and a y. And here's particle one. And I could choose to describe this system xy coordinates.", "start": 630.0, "heat": 0.255}, {"text": " And I'll specify the location in the system with coordinates x1 and y1. Two values to specify the location of that. And down here I'm going to pick two more values, x2 and y2, just to describe the-- so x1 is a different coordinate from x2. x1 is the exposition of particle one. x2 is the x position of particle two. y1 and y2. So how many coordinates do I have to describe the system? How many have I used? Four, right? How many degrees of freedom do you think this problem has? Two. So there's something already a little out of whack here. But the point is these aren't independent, you'll find. You just do a test. You'll find that these aren't independent. If I fix x1 and x2, systems doesn't move. If I say this is going to be one and this has got to be three, this system is now frozen. So this system of core coordinates is not independent. What did we say? Independent. When you fix all but one coordinate, you still have continuous range of movement of the final one. I could fix only just two of these", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.371}, {"text": " and I've frozen the system. I don't even have to go to the extent of fixing three. I'm assuming the strings are of fixed length. You can't change the string length. So this is not a very good choice of coordinates. And we had a hint that it might not be, because it's more than we ought to use. We only really need two. So and then if we choose these angles, v1 and v2, let's do the test with that. Are those independent? So those are the coordinates of the system. If you fix v1, is there still free and continuous movement of v2 of the system? Sure. And if you fixed v2, it means you can require this angle stay rigid like that, and move v2, well, the whole system will still move. So v1 and v2 are a system which satisfies the independence requirement. Complete. They're both systems that are complete. They're both capable locating all points at all times. But only the pair v1 and v2 in this example are both independent and complete. Now, the third requirement is a thing called holonomicity. And what it means to be holonomic is that the system, the number of degrees of freedom required", "start": 810.0, "heat": 0.199}, {"text": " is equal to the number of coordinates required to completely describe the motion. Now, every example we've ever done so far in this class satisfies that. We picked v1 and v2 and that's all the coordinates that we need to completely to describe the motion. Let me see if I can figure out a counter example. I didn't write down this definition. So holonomic. And if the answer to this question is no, you cannot use Lagrange equations. So let's see if I can show you an example of a system in which you need more coordinates than you have degrees of freedom.", "start": 900.0, "heat": 0.419}, {"text": " I've got a ball. This is an xy plane. And I'm not going to allow it to translate in z. And I'm not going to allow it to rotate about the z-axis. So those are two constraints. So this is one rigid body.

I'm not going to allow it to slip in the x. So now I've got another. Now I'm down to three. And I'm not going to allow it to slip in the y. Two. So by our calculus of how many degrees of freedom you need, we're down to two. We should be able to completely describe the motion of this system with two coordinates. OK.

It's in the back. So I've gone to the same position but I've ended up with the ball not in the same orientation as it was. I went by two different paths. And the ball comes up over here rather than up there where it started. OK So to actually describe where the ball is at any place out here, having gotten there by rolling around, without slipping and without z rotation, how many coordinates do you think it'll take to actually specify where that stripe is at any arbitrary place that it's gotten to on the plane? Name them. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: So. In order to actually fully describe it, you've got to say where it is x and y and you actually have to say some kind of theta and phi rotations that it's gone through so that you know where this is.

Is it holonomic? No problem. We need t 1/2 mx dot squared. We need v. And we have 1/2 kx squared for the spring minus mgx for the gravitational potential energy. And now we can start.

My brain is getting ahead of my writing here. That's normally b and this would be k. I'm not trying to really mess you up there. So would be bx dot, right. And is there anything else? Are there any other non conservative forces, things that could put energy into or out of the system? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: So the damper can certainly extract energy. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: Yeah, the force f. That external, it might be something that's making it vibrate or whatever. But it's an external force, and it could do work on the system. And it's not a potential. It's not a spring and it's not gravity. It's coming up and somebody's shaking it or something like that. So f is also non conservative. So the non conservative forces in this thing are f in the i direction and minus vx dot", "start": 1620.0, "heat": 0.916}, {"text": " in the i direction.

That would be what our free body diagram would look like. That's a conservative force. Oops, and we need an mg. So we have two conservative forces, kx and mg, and we have two non conservative forces, bx dot and f. So in this case, some of the non conservative forces is that f in the i direction minus bx in the x dot in the i direction. So let's do our calculus here. So 1 d by dt of the partial of the t, which is 1/2 mx dot squared with respect to x dot. So that gives me the derivative of x dot squared with respect to x dot gives me 2 mx dot. So this is d by dt of mx dot. But that's mx double dot. And as you might expect when you're trying to drive equation of motion, you're probably going to end up with an mx double dot in the result.

The virtual displacements in all the possible degrees of freedom of the system. We do them one at a time. This case we'll only have one, so it's trivial. But this could be delta one, two, three, four. And each one of them might do some work when f moves through it. But work is f dot the displacement. So it's the component of the force in the direction of the movement, the dot product, that gives you this little bit of virtual work.

You have to account for the unstretched length of the spring. So call l 0 is the unstretched spring length. We know that also. So I propose that the potential energy look like 1/2, for the spring, anyway, 1/2 the amount that it stretches in a movement x1.

Actually that's the moving coordinate system unit vector in the y direction. And so we do the dot product. You get this times itself. i dot i and j dot j. This quantity here is 1/2 m2 x dot squared plus x, this next one I guess. x1 squared of theta dot squared. That's the kinetic energy of accounting for the velocity of the center of mass.

How many times do we have to turn the crank and go through the Lagrangian? Got to go through it twice. So let's apply Lagrange here. And we'll just do number one first. So and let's see. Which one do I have on my paper first? I guess we'll do the x1 equation. This is delta x1. So this generalized coordinate x1. And we need to do term one, which is in d by dt of partial of t with respect to x1 dot. OK. So we look at this and say, well, is this a function? Is this term a function of x? Nothing. You get nothing from there. Is this term a function of x? Yeah, it's down here. We only have to take the derivative of this. We have to do that job.

But you know a lot about Newton's laws and you know a lot about calculating equations of motion now using sum of torques and all that stuff, right? So this is just something moving, has a circular motion, has translational motion. What other accelerations had better appear in this equation of motion? And which equation are we getting? There's going to be two equations and it has physical significance to it. What equation does this begin to look like? Just physically, what movement is being accounted for here? Looks like translation in the x direction. It's this thing sliding. It's this part of the motion sliding up and down.

What other acceleration terms do you expect to appear in this from what you know? Yeah. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: A centripetal term. Do you believe there ought to be a centripetal term in this answer? Why? Because it's got circular motion involved. For sure. Any others? Is there any Coriolis in this? In this direction. Which direction are we working in? Is there Coriolis acceleration in the x direction? By the way, these equations, do we have any ijk's in here? These are pure scalar equations. No unit vectors involved. This equation only described motion in the x. So will there be a Coriolis force in this acceleration in this problem? Will there be an Eulerian acceleration in this equation of motion? The reason I'm going through this with you, I want you to start developing your own intuition about whether or not when you get it at the end it's got everything it ought to have and doesn't have stuff it shouldn't have.", "start": 3600.0, "heat": 0.454}, {"text": " OK. So your forecasting, then we better get a centripetal term. Well, let's see what happens. So that was number one. Number two here is our dt by minus the derivative with respect to x, in this case.

So this fellow is going to give us minus m2 x1 theta dot squared. What's that look like? There it is. There's your centripetal term you're expecting to get. OK. And step three is plus partial of v with respect to x. In this case with respect to x. And where's our potential energy expression? Well, it's up here. And where the x dependency is in it. There is no x in that term and no x in that term.", "start": 3690.0, "heat": 0.263}, {"text": " But we have x's in both of these other terms. So when we run through this, I'll write down what we come up with. We get certainly a spring term. k x1 minus l0 minus l2 over 2. So that's the spring piece when you take the derivative. The two cancels the 1/2 and the derivative of parts inside just gives you 1. So that's the first piece of the potential energy expression. And the second piece is only going to come from here. The derivative of this with respect to x1 is just m2g cosine theta minus.

I still have to find what the generalized force is in the x direction. So all that's left to do for this problem is to find q sub x, the generalized force that goes on the right hand side. So now let's draw a little diagram here of my system. And at the end of the sleeve. So here's my sleeve. I've applied this force. This is f of t. And maybe it's some f not cosine omega t. It's an oscillatory force, external force. Make it vibrate. And I need to know the virtual work done making that force go through a displacement in what direction?

It's a function of time. But this side then is cosine theta i. No, hey, I got this wrong. I drew this wrong, I'm sorry. This is theta. This is going to be sine. This side is sine theta in the i direction. And this piece is f0 of t cosine theta in the j. So I break it up in two parts.

And then at the end I take this out and this is the qx that I'm looking for. So my final equation of motion says, this equals f0 cosine omega t sine theta. And that's your equation of motion in the x1 direction. So when you finish one of these, you need to ask yourself, does this make sense? Does this jive with my understanding of Newtonian physics? Better have a linear acceleration term, because that's what it's doing. You have another acceleration term in the same direction due to centripetal. A spring force for sure. And a component of gravity in the direction of motion, up and down the slide, equal to any external forces in that direction. So it makes pretty good sense. OK. Now, also another test you can do is does it satisfy the laws of statics? That's another check you could perform. Does this thing at static equilibrium tell the truth? A static equilibrium all time derivative is 0. So this would be 0, this would be 0. You know its static equilibrium hangs down, so cosine theta is 1.", "start": 4140.0, "heat": 0.258}, {"text": " Static you don't have any time dependent forces. That's 0. So the static part of this says that k x1 minus l0 minus l2 over 2 equals m2g cosine. And that's cosine theta is 1, so it's m2g. And you could figure out then this must be k times something. This is the x. This is the amount of the spring stretches, the static stretch of the spring, so the spring has an equal and opposite force to the weight of the thing m2g. So that's another check you can do when doing the problems. OK, I'll write up the final one. We have one more question to go. Got to do all the derivatives with respect to theta. So you take a minute to decide how many acceleration terms and what acceleration terms do you expect to see come out of this second equation of motion. Because now we're talking about which motion? Swinging motion. And what's its direction? In Newtonian sense, it would have a vector direction.

PROFESSOR: Going to get an Eulerian, which means you've got a theta double dot term. You're expecting a theta double dot term to show up. OK. What else? Will you get a Coriolis term? Do you expect a Coriolis term? Something that looks like x dot theta dot. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: Yeah. The thing is sliding up and down the sleeve. It has a non 0 value of x dot. Any time you got things moving radially while something is swinging in a circle, you will get Coriolis forces.

The potential energy pace gives you m2g x1 sine theta plus m1 g l1 over 2 sine theta. And the fourth piece, the q theta, well, that's just going to be the virtual work done. There's a tricky bit to this one. Now there's virtual work, but which direction? So we have an f dot dr. The only f we have is this. What's the dr? What direction is it? This is the theta coordinate. What direction does that give you displacements? f dot dr's a displacement, not an angle. To get the work done, you got to move a force through a distance. So the distance, first of all, is in what direction when theta moves? j. Little j hat, right? And now if you get a virtual deflection of delta theta, what's the virtual displacement?
