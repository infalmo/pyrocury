were to publish some\npaper on using Avogadro'snumber, it would take me\nforever to write this.And even more, it's hard to\ntell if I forgot to write a zeroor if I maybe wrote\ntoo many zeroes.So

has no 0's.No 0's in it.10 to the 1 has one 0.10 to the second power-- I was\ngoing to say the two-th power.10 to the second\npower has two 0's.Finally, 10 to the\nthird has three 0's.Don't want to beat\na dead horse here,but I think you get the idea.Three 0's.If I were to do 10\nto the 100th power,what would that look like?I don't feel like\nwriting it all out here,but it would be 1 followed\nby-- you could guess it--a hundred 0's.So it would just\nbe a bunch of 0's.And if we were to count\nup all of those 0's, you", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.383}, {"text": "would have one

how\nmany digits in it?It has 1, 2, 3, and\nthen twenty 0's.So it has 23 digits after the 6.23 digits after the 6.So what happens if I use this--\nif I try to get close to itwith a power of 10?So what

the decimal right there.And there you have it, 7.345\ntimes 1,000 is indeed 7,345.Let's do a couple of them.Let's say we wanted\nto write the number6 in scientific notation.Obviously, there's no need to\nwrite in scientific notation.But how would you do it?Well, what's the largest\npower of 10 that fits into 6?Well, the largest power of 10\nthat fits into 6 is just 1.So we could write it

is much simpler,\nbut it shows youthat you really can express any\nnumber in scientific notation.Now, what if we wanted to\nrepresent something like this?I had started off the\nvideo saying in

7.Well, once again, this is not\nan easy number to deal with.But how can we deal with\nit as a power of 10?As a power of 10?So what's the largest power of\n10 that fits into this number,that this number\nis divisible by?So let's think about it.All the powers of 10 we did\nbefore were going to positiveor going to-- well, yeah,\npositive powers of 10.We could also do\nnegative powers of 10.We

of my decimal pointsbecause she's a doctor.And if people don't\nsee the decimal point,someone might overdose\non some medication.So let's write it her\nway, 0.0000000008192.Clearly, this is a
