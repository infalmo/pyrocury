[{"text": "[SQUEAKING][RUSTLING][CLICKING]SCOTT HUGHES: The key\ntextbook for this classis Sean Carroll's textbook\non general relativity.It's now almost 20 years old.I would say-- I\nthink it's listedon the website as required.I would actually call it\nsort of semi-required.It is where I will tend to\npost most of the readingsto the course.It's a really good, complete\ntextbook for a one semestercourse, which is what\nwe have, and I will notbe going through\nthe entire thing.You can't in a one\nsemester course.And I will, from time to time,\nthere will be a few topics thatI cannot go as in into as\ndeeply as I would like,and if we had two semesters\nmaybe I'd be able to doa little bit more.And so for those\nwho are interested,I will suggest readings in this.My personal favorite supplement\nto this is a textbookby Bernard Schutz , A First\nCourse in General Relativity.OK, so these are all things\nwhere-- so the MIT bookstore,I'm not sure how\nmuch they carry.They're all available\nthrough Amazon,and you can definitely\nfind these kind of things.If you get Schutz's\ntextbook, definitelyget the second edition.The first edition\ncontains errors.There is actually a very\nimportant geometric objectthat we are going to\nintroduce in a couple of weeksthat his textbook has a\nreally clever derivation of.I remember seeing that\nand thinking, wow,that's really clever.The reason he was able do it so\nsimply is because it's wrong.AUDIENCE: [LAUGH]SCOTT HUGHES: It's corrected\nin the second edition.Another one is Gravitation by\nMisner, Thorne and Wheeler.This is sort of a bit of\npersonal history for me.I was Thorne's graduate student,\nand I used this textbook", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.102}, {"text": "when I learned this\nsubject originally.I, frankly, do not\nrecommend this textbookto somebody who is learning\nthe subject for the first time.It's a good place for a\nreference for certain things.It's available in\nthe reading room.Know where you can get\na copy and pick it up.So first of all,\npicking it up iskind of a-- it's good exercise.It's actually like a--you know, it's a huge book.It gravitates.So it's a great\nreference and hasa couple of good sections\nin it for new students.But I will indicate from\ntime to time, especiallysome of the stuff we do in\nthe second half of the class,my lectures are kind of inspired\nby Misner, Thorne and Wheeler--known as MTW.And for those of you who have\nsort of a more mathematicallyminded approach to things,\nGeneral Relativity by Wald.In the course syllabus I\ncall this the uber book.This really is sort of\nthe self-contained bookthat really pins down the\nsubject very, very well.It's quite terse and formal,\nbut also very, very clear.If you are a mathematically\nminded thinker,you will find this to be\na really good textbookto refer to.There is one\nparticular derivationthat I'm going to do in\nabout a month and a halfthat I essentially take\nfrom Wald's textbookbecause it's just beautiful.Other things in it--to me, it's a little too terse\nfrom my own personal taste,but others may find\nit to be pretty good.Two other quick things.So there are 11 problem\nsets and your gradeis determined entirely\non these problems sets.The syllabus gives the schedule\nfor when they will be posted", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and when they are\nto be handed in.11 does not divide evenly\ninto 100, so what we do is wehave 10 that are worth 9%\nof your grade and the 11this worth 10% of your grade.Is that 11th one\nreally 1% longer?I don't know.Again, I'm taking the viewpoint\nthat you are graduate students,or at least you're playing one\nfor the next hour and a half,and if you're going to sweat\nthe difference of one percentagepoint on that thing, come on.This is about\nlearning the material,don't worry about those\nlittle details that much.That is where all\nof your assessmentis going to come from.The very first time I lectured\nthis course I had a final exam,and it just turned to be a\ncomplete waste of my timeand the students' time.You really cannot write--you either write\nproblems that areso easy that you can\ndo them in your sleep,or they're so difficult\nyou can't do themin the time period of an exam.So we're just going to\nstick with problem setsand that's fine.Let's move into, then,\nthe way the courseis going to be structured.So my presentation\nof this material--the first half of the course\nbasically up to spring breakis essentially the\nmathematical foundationsof general relativity.There are several\nchoices that need to bemade when you're doing this.This often, in\nsome universities,if they have multiple\nsemester sequences, whatI'm going to cover\nin this first halfof our semester in some places\ngoes for a full semester.And what this means is there's\na couple of things that I justcannot cover in\nquite as much depth.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.133}, {"text": "Those will be things\nwhere, for those of you whoare interested in it, have that\nkind of a mathematical thinkingof things, happy to push\nyou to additional readings.We can dive in and look\nat it a bit more depth.My goal is to give\nyou just enough stuffthat we can do the most\nimportant applicationsof this subject.And I'm an astrophysicist,\nand to be blunt,most of my really\ninteresting applicationstend to be things that have to\ndo with things like cosmology,black holes, dense stars,\nand things like that.And so I want to get\nenough formalism togetherthat we can get to\nthat part of things.And so the goal of this\nis that by the week rightbefore spring break what\nwe will do is \"derive\"--I put that in quotes, and you'll\nsee why a little bit later--the Einstein field\nequations that governgravity in general relativity.So there are several\nthings that wecould do that are not strictly\nnecessary to get there,and just because\nof time limitationsI'm going to choose to\nelide a few of these topics.The second half will\nthen be applications.We will use everything we\nderived in the first halfto see how general relativity\ngives us a relativistic theoryof gravity.We will begin applying it.We'll see how Newton's law\nis encoded in these fieldequations.We'll see how we go\nbeyond Newton's law,get some of the classic\ntests of general relativity,and then start\nlooking at solving itfor more interesting systems.Looking at the evolution\nof the universe as a whole,looking at the behavior\nof black holes,looking for gravitational\nwaves, constructingthe spacetime of neutron\nstars, things like that.So it's a fun semester.It sort of works well to fit\nthese two things in like this.And for those of you who are\ninterested in taking things", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "more deeply, there's a lot\nof room to grow after this.And it does look like-- so\npeople who particularly wouldlike to go a little bit more\ndetail on some of the math,if you've looked\nat the syllabus,I have one of my\nabsolute favorite quotesfrom a course evaluation\nis put on there.Where a student in\n2007 or so wrote,\"The course was fine as it\nwas, but Professor Hughesas an astrophysicist\ntended to focuson really mundane topics like\ncosmology and black holes.\"If you think those are\nmundane topics, what canI say, guilty as charged.But for those you who do want\nto take a different approachthese sorts of\nthings, we'll probablyalternate lecturing this course\nin the future between someonefrom the CTP who works\nmore in quantum gravityand things related to that.That'll be Netta Engelhardt\nin spring of 2021.We're now ready to\nstart talking about,after doing all\nthis sort of prep,we can actually talk about\nsome of the foundationsof the theory.So before I dive in,\nare there any questions?All right.What we're going to begin doing\nfor the first couple of weeks--well, not really\nfirst couple weeks.The first couple of\nlectures, is we'regoing to begin by discussing\nspecial relativity,but we're going to do\nspecial relativity usingmathematical language that\nemphasizes the geometric natureof this form of relativity.What this does is it allows\nus to introduce basically", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "the formalism, the notation,\nall the different tools thatare important for when\nthings get more complicated.When we apply a lot of these\ntools to special relativity,like we will be doing\nin the first threeor so lectures of\nthis course, it'skind of like swatting a\nmosquito with a sledgehammer.You really don't need that\nmuch mathematical structureto discuss special relativity.But you're going to be\ngrateful for that sledgehammerwhen we start talking about\nstrong field orbits of rotatingblack holes, right.And so the whole idea of this\nis to develop the frameworkin terms of a\nphysical system whereit's simple to understand\nwhat is going on.These are sort of\na way to introducethe mathematical\ntools in a place wherethe physics is straightforward\nand then kind of carry forwardfrom there.I will caution that\nas a consequenceof this many students find\nthese first three lectures to bea little on the dull side.So, sorry.It's just some stuff that we\nkind of have to get out there,and then as we generalize\nto more interestingmathematical objects, more\ninteresting physical settings,it gets more interesting.All right, so let's dive in.So the setting for everything\nthat we will be doingis a geometric concept\nknown as spacetime.So we give you a precise\nmathematical definitionof spacetime.A spacetime is a\nmanifold of eventsthat is endowed with a metric.So, a wonderful mathematical\ndefinition, and I'vewritten it in a way that\nrequires me to carefully definethree additional terms.The concepts that\nI've underlined here,I've not defined\nthem yet precisely", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "exactly what I mean by them.So let's go over\nto the sideboardand talk about what\nexactly these are.So a manifold-- if you\nare a mathematician,you might twitch a\nlittle bit about the waythat I am going to\ndefine this, and Iwill point you to a reading\nthat does it a little bit moreprecisely.But for the purposes\nof our class,a manifold is\nessentially just a setor a collection of points\nwith well understoodconnectedness properties.What I mean by\nthat, is I'm goingto talk about manifolds\nof space and time.I haven't defined an event\nyet, but I'm about to,but I'm going to say that\nthere's a bunch of events thathappen at this place and at this\ntime and a bunch of events thathappen at this place\nand at this time.And the manifold, the\nspacetime, gives mesome notion of how I\nconnect the events over hereto the events over here.A manifold is a\ntautological concept.It's all about how one connects\none region to another one.So if you're working\non a manifold thatlives on the surface\nof a donut, youhave a particular topology\nassociated with that.If it lives on the\nsurface of a sphereyou have a different\ntopology associated with it.If you would like to see\nmore careful and morerigorous discussion\nof this, thisis one of the places where\nCarroll is very good.So go into Carroll, at\nleast in the editionthat I have it's\non pages 54 to 62.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "He introduces a bit of\nadditional mathematicalmachinery, discusses things\nwith a little more rigorthan I'm doing here--this isn't rigorous at all,\nso significantly more rigorthan I'm doing here.Those of you are into that,\nthat should be somethingthat you enjoy.So an event.This is when and where\nsomething happens.Could be anything.From our point of view,\nthe event essentiallyis going to be the\nfundamental notionof a coordinate in space time.We will actually,\nin many cases--actually, that's bad word\nchoice, I should say.Coordinates are\nactually sort of labelsthat we attach to events.We are going to\nbe free to adjustthose labels, but the underlying\ngeometric idea that the eventis here, that's independent of\nthe coordinates that we choose.So we will label these\nthings with coordinates.But the event itself exists\nindependent of these labels.Just to give an\nexample, there mightbe one event which is I\npunch myself in the head.And so I'm very\negotistic, so I will saythis event happened at time 0--x, y, and z equals 0.Because I define this\ncorner of my skullas the origin the\ncoordinate system,", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and I always think whatever's\nhappening right nowis the origin of time.Those of you out in the\nroom are also egocentricand you would say whatever,\nI'm going to call that--let's say you are\nat y of 3 metersand I'm going to put the floor\nas the origin of my z-axis,so z of 1.7 meters or whatever.You will come with your\nown independent labelingof these things.So you're all\nfamiliar with the ideathat we can just change\ncoordinate systems.I'm going to harp on\nthis a bit, though,because there's going to be a\nreally important distinction wemake between\ngeometrical objects thatlive in this\nmanifold of spacetimeand how we represent them using\nlabels that might be attachedto coordinate systems.And I'm going to\ncome back to thiswhen we start talking about some\nadditional geometric objectsin just a couple of minutes.So the last object that I\nhave introduced into hereis one that we\nwill begin talkingabout in a lot more detail\nin the next lecture,but let me put it\ninto here right away.And so that is the metric.Metric comes from a\nroot meaning to measure,and what this is\nis it's somethingit gives me a notion of distance\nbetween events in the manifold.For physics to work,\nthis has to exist, right?But it's worth knowing\nthat the idea of a manifoldis in some way more\nprimitive than this.You can have a manifold\nwithout any notionof a metric attached to it.And if that's the case--people like to joke\nthat if you don'tknow what the difference\nis between a metricwith a manifold\nand without a man--excuse me, a manifold with a\nmetric and without a metric,feel free to drink\ncoffee out of a donut.Because topologically, those\nare the exact same thing,but their geometry, which is\nencoded in the metric, whichtells me how the different\npoints on that manifoldare arranged, are\nrather different.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "What this basically\ndoes is it's goingto give me a mathematical object\nthat enforces or really conveysthe idea that different\nevents in this manifoldhave a particular\ndistance between them.So without this, a\nmanifold has no notionof distance encoded in it.So the two things\ntogether really makethis concept come to life.You can see a lot\nmore, like I said.You can get more information\nabout many of these conceptsfrom the readings in\nCarroll, Wald's textbookalso goes into quite a lot\nof detail about this stuff.So this is the venue.This is the setting in which we\nare going to talk about things.And just cutting\nforward roughly 2and 1/2 months'\nworth of lectures,what we are going to find is\nthat part of Einstein's geniusis that it turns out that\nthis notion of the metricends up encoding gravity.So that's kind of\nwhere we're goingto end up going with things.The idea that the\nmathematical structurethat tells me how far\napart two events areis intimately connected to\nthe properties of gravity.It's pretty cool, and\nit is something that--physics is an\nexperimental science.All of our measurements\nare consistent with it.So that's cool.So everything I have said\nso far, nothing but math.Nothing but definitions.So let's start working with\na particular form of physics.So we are going to begin, as I\nsaid, with special relativity.This is the simplest\ntheory of spacetime", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "that is compatible with\nphysics as we know it.Not fully compatible, but\ndoes a pretty good job.And we'll see that it\nturns out to correspondto general relativity\nwhen there is no gravity.So to set this up\nwe need to havesome kind of a way of\nlabeling our events.And so I'm going to introduce\nkind of a conceptual--you almost think of\nit as scaffolding,which we're going to use to\nbuild a lot of our conceptsaround.And in this one--I mean that in a kind\nof an abstract sense.There's going to be\nsort of the edificethat we use to help us\nbuild the building that'sgoing to be the mathematics\nof general relativity.But this one really is\nkind of like a scaffolding.Because what I want\nto introduce hereis a notion of what is called\nan inertial reference frame.So I'm going to\nsketch this quickly,and I'm going to post\nto the course websitea chapter from an\nearly draft textbookby Roger Blandford\nand Kip Thorne.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So when I talk about the\ninertial reference frame,I want you to sort of\nvisualize in your heada lattice of clocks--clocks and measuring rods--that allows us to label,\nin other words, to assigncoordinates any event\nthat happens in spacetime.So just sort of, in\nyour head, imaginethat there's this grid of little\nclocks and measuring rods,and a mosquito\nlands on your head.It's right near a particular\nrod and a particular clock.It bites you, that's an event.You slap it, that's\nanother event.And the measuring\nrods and eventsare what allows\nyou to sort of keeptrack of the ordering\nof those eventsand where they happen\nin this four dimensionalmanifold of spacetime.So I'm going to\nrequire this latticeto have a certain\nset of properties.First, I'm going to say that\nthis lattice moves freelythrough spacetime.What do I mean by moving freely?I mean no forces act on\nit, it does not rotate,it is inertial.Every clock and every\nmeasuring rod has no inertia,no force is acting on it at all.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "You look at that, you might\nthink to yourself, well,why don't you make it at rest?Well, I did.It's at rest in\nrespect to someone,but we might have a different\nobserver who's coming alongwho has no forces acting on her,\nand she's moving relative to meat three quarters\nthe speed of light.It's not at rest with\nrespects to that observer.That's actually kind\nof the key here.So this inertial reference\nframe is at rest with respectto someone who feels no forces\nbut not to all observers.I'm going to require that\nmy measuring rods areorthogonal to each other.So they define an orthogonal\ncoordinate system,and I am also going to require\nthat the little markingson them that tell me\nwhere things happenare uniformly ticked.In other words, I'm\ngoing to just make surethat the spacing\nbetween tick markshere is exactly the same as\nthe spacing between tick markshere.You may sort of think well,\nthat's a result or an ideaworthy of the journal Duh, but\nit's important to specify this.You want to make sure that\nthe standard you are usingto define length is the same\nin this region of spacetimeas it is over in this\nregion of spacetime.When we start getting\ninto general relativity,", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "we start to see there can be\nconcerns about this comingabout, so it's worth\nspelling it out and makingit clear at the beginning.I'm also going to require\nthat my clocks tick uniformly.We're going to make\nthis lattice thatfills all of spacetime\nusing the bestthing that Swiss\nengineers can make for us,we want to make sure that one\nsecond, an interval of onesecond, is the same\nhere in this classroomas it is somewhere off\nin the Andromeda Galaxy.We want to make sure that there\nis no evolution to the timestandard when we do this.Finally, I'm going to\nsynchronize all these clockswith each other in\nthe following way.This is going to use the\nEinstein synchronizationprocedure.This is the first place\nwhere a little bit of physicsis actually beginning to\nfinally enter our discussion.I'll comment that--I'm going to go through\nwhat this procedure isin just a second.But an Easter egg here.Whenever you see a name\nthat has Einstein in it,your ears should\nperk up a little.Because it probably means\nthis is something important.This is, after all, a\ncourse in relativity,and that tends to be the\nthings that end up mattering.Even when they end up\nbeing really easy to--things we look at now and\nkind of see as fairly obvious,it's important, OK, and we often\nattach Einstein's name to this.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So this Einstein\nsynchronization procedure, thistakes advantage of the fact--and by the way, we're not going\nto teach special relativityin this course, 8.962.I assume you have already\nstudied special relativityand you're all experts in this,\nand so I can freely borrowfrom its important results.This procedure takes\nadvantage of the factthat the speed of light is\nthe same to all observers,no matter what\ninertial referenceframe they might be in.So the speed of light\nis a key invariant.It connects--\nbecause it's a speed,it connects space and\ntime, and because itis the same to all observers,\nit defines a particular standardfor relating space\nand time that isgoing to have important\ninvariant meaning associatedwith it.Just to remind you what\nthis means-- let's see,do I have a laser\npointer with me?I might, but don't\nworry about it.I have a pretend laser pointer.My chalk's a laser pointer.I point my laser\npointer at the walland you all see it dashing\nacross the room at 300,000kilometers per second.I then start jogging at half the\nspeed of light, as is my wont,and continuing to point that,\nyou guys measure the lightgoing across the room.You still measure 300,000\nkilometers per second.I, on the other hand,\nmeasure the lightcoming out of my\nlaser pointer and Iget 300,000\nkilometers per second.So just because my\nlaser pointer ismoving at half the speed\nof light according to youdoesn't mean the light\nthat's coming out of itis boosted to a higher speed.If you studied\nspecial relativityyou'll know that its energy\nis boosted to a higher energylevel, but the speed of\nlight is always just C.", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So we're going to\ntake advantage of thatto come up with a way of\nsynchronizing our clocks.The way it works is this.So let's look at a two\ndimensional slice of my latticehere.Time, and let's make\nthis be the x-axis.And so I will have, let's say,\nthis is where clock one existsand this is where\nclock two exists.Let's go into the\nreference framethat is at rest with\nrespect to this lattice.We want to synchronize\nclock one with clock two.So as time marches on,\nthese guys stand still.So here's the path\nin spacetime--the world line, traced\nout by clock one.Here's the clock path in\nspacetime, the world line,traced out by clock two.So let's say-- let's\ncall this event--let's say that this event\nhappens at a time t1e.t1 is when clock one\nemits a pulse of light.So this light will just follow\na little trajectory a bitthrough spacetime.This goes out and strikes\nclock two at which pointit is bounced back to clock one.Let's ignore this point\nfor just a second.So let's just say for the\nmoment that this is thenreflected back and then it\nis received back at clock one", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "at a time t1r.Let's make this a\nlittle bit neater.t1e, t1r.Clock one receives\nthe reflected pulse.So the moment at\nwhich it bounces,we'll call that t2b, that is\nthe moment at which the lightbounces off of clock two.And the way we\nsynchronize our clocksis just by requiring\nthat this beequal to the average of the\nemission and the receptiontime.Totally trivial idea, right?All I'm saying is I'm\ngoing to just require thatin order for clock\none and clock twoto be synchronized\nto one another,let's make sure that when I\nbounce light between any twopairs of clocks they\nare set such that whenthe light bounces\nit's the midway pointbetween the total light--the halfway of the\ntotal light traveltime that the light moves along.Very, very simple concept.So there's nothing\nparticularly deephere, but notice Einstein's\nname is attached to this.And I don't say that to be--I'm not being sarcastic.It really points\nto the fact that weare using one of the\nmost fundamental resultsof special relativity\nin designinghow these clocks work in this\ninertial reference frame.Believe it or not, this thing,\nthis really simple concept, itcomes back to sort of bite us\non the butt a little bit

going to get to some\nobjects where gravity isso strong that light\ncannot escape them.And we're going to find\nthat our perhaps most naiveways of labeling time in the\nspacetime of such objectskind of goes completely haywire.Fundamentally, the reason\nwhy time is going haywirewhen you have really\nstrong gravityis because we use\nlight as our toolfor synchronizing\nall of our clocks,and if the way that light\nmoves in your space timeis affected, the way\nyou're going to label timeis going to be affected.So this is a very\nsimple concept.Again, I sort of emphasize\nthese first couple

fortnight,whatever it is that you're\nmost comfortable with,C is effectively a\nconversion factor then.And so what this means\nis that when we do thisall velocities that we measure\nare going to be
