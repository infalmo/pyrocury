[{"text": "GILBERT STRANG: OK.Well, the idea of\nthis first videois to tell you what's coming,\nto give a kind of outlineof what is reasonable to learn\nabout ordinary differentialequations.And a big part of\nthe series willbe videos on first order\nequations and videoson second order equations.Those are the ones you\nsee most in applications.And those are the ones you\ncan understand and solve,when you're fortunate.So first order equations\nmeans first derivativescome into the equation.So that's a nice equation\nthat we will solve,we'll spend a lot of time on.The derivative is-- that's\nthe rate of change of y--the changes in the unknown\ny-- as time goes forwardare partly from depending\non the solution itself.That's the idea of a\ndifferential equation,that it connects the changes\nwith the function y as it is.And then you have\ninputs called q of t,which produce their own change.They go into the system.They become part of y.And they grow, decay,\noscillate, whatever y of t does.So that is a linear equation\nwith a right-hand side,with an input, a forcing term.And here is a\nnonlinear equation.The derivative of y.The slope depends on y.So it's a differential equation.But f of y could be y squared\nover y cubed or the sine of y", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "or the exponential of y.So it could be not linear.Linear means that\nwe see y by itself.Here we won't.Well, we'll come\npretty close to gettinga solution, because it's\na first order equation.And the most general first\norder equation, the functionwould depend on t and y.The input would\nchange with time.Here, the input depends only\non the current value of y.I might think of y\nas money in a bank,growing, decaying, oscillating.Or I might think of y as\nthe distance on a spring.Lots of applications coming.OK.So those are first\norder equations.And second order have\nsecond derivatives.The second derivative\nis the acceleration.It tells you about the\nbending of the curve.If I have a graph, the\nfirst derivative we knowgives the slope of the graph.Is it going up?Is it going down?Is it a maximum?The second derivative tells\nyou the bending of the graph.How it goes away\nfrom a straight line.So and that's acceleration.So Newton's law-- the\nphysics we all live with--would be acceleration\nis some force.And there is a force that\ndepends, again, linearly--that's a keyword-- on y.Just y to the first power.And here is a little bit\nmore general equation.In Newton's law,\nthe accelerationis multiplied by the mass.So this includes a physical\nconstant here, the mass.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Then there could\nbe some damping.If I have motion, there may\nbe friction slowing it down.That depends on the first\nderivative, the velocity.And then there could be the\nsame kind of forced termthat depends on y itself.And there could be some outside\nforce, some person or machinethat's creating movement.An external forcing term.So that's a big equation.And let me just\nsay, at this point,we let things be nonlinear.And we had a pretty good chance.If we get these\nto be non-linear,the chance at second\norder has dropped.And the further\nwe go, the more weneed linearity and maybe\neven constant coefficients.m, b, and k.So that's really\nthe problem that wecan solve as we get good at\nit is a linear equation--second order, let's say--\nwith constant coefficients.But that's pretty\nmuch pushing whatwe can hope to do\nexplicitly and reallyunderstand the\nsolution, because solinear with constant\ncoefficients.Say it again.That's the good equations.And I think of\nsolutions in two ways.If I have a really nice\nfunction like a exponential.Exponentials are\nthe great functionsof differential equations, the\ngreat functions in this series.You'll see them over and over.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Exponentials.Say f of t equals-- e to the t.Or e to the omega t.Or e to the i omega t.That i is the square\nroot of minus 1.In those cases, we will get\na similarly nice functionfor the solution.Those are the best.We get a function that we\nknow like exponentials.And we get solutions\nthat we know.Second best are we get some\nfunction we don't especiallyknow.In that case, the\nsolution probablyinvolves an integral of\nf, or two integrals of f.We have a formula for it.That formula includes\nan integrationthat we would have to\ndo, either look it upor do it numerically.And then when we get to\ncompletely non-linearfunctions, or we have\nvarying coefficients,then we're going\nto go numerically.So really, the wide,\nwide part of the subjectends up as numerical solutions.But you've got a\nwhole bunch of videoscoming that have nice\nfunctions and nice solutions.OK.So that's first order\nand second order.Now there's more, because\na system doesn't usuallyconsist of just a single\nresistor or a single spring.In reality, we have\nmany equations.And we need to deal with those.So y is now a vector.y1, y2, to yn.n different unknowns.n different equations.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "That's n equation.So here that is\nan n by n matrix.So it's first order.Constant coefficient.So we'll be able\nto get somewhere.But it's a system of\nn coupled equations.And so is this one with\na second derivative.Second derivative\nof the solution.But again, y1 to yn.And we have a matrix,\nusually a symmetric matrixthere, we hope, multiplying y.So again, linear.Constant coefficients.But several equations at once.And that will bring in\nthe idea of eigenvaluesand eigenvectors.Eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nis a key bit of linear algebrathat makes these\nproblems simple,because it turns\nthis coupled probleminto n uncoupled problems.n first order equations that\nwe can solve separately.Or n second order equations\nthat we can solve separately.That's the goal with\nmatrices is to uncouple them.OK.And then really the big\nreality of this subjectis that solutions\nare found numericallyand very efficiently.And there's a lot to learn\nabout that, a lot to learn.And MATLAB is a\nfirst-class packagethat gives you numerical\nsolutions with many options.One of the options\nmay be the favorite.ODE for ordinary\ndifferential equations 4 5.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And that is numbers 4, 5.Well, Cleve Moler, who\nwrote the package MATLAB,is going to create a\nseries of parallel videosexplaining the steps\ntoward numerical solution.Those steps begin with\na very simple method.Maybe I'll put the\ncreator's name down.Euler.So you can know that because\nEuler was centuries ago,he didn't have a computer.But he had a simple\nway of approximating.So Euler might be ODE 1.And now we've left Euler behind.Euler is fine, but not\nsufficiently accurate.ODE 45, that 4 and 5 indicate a\nmuch higher accuracy, much moreflexibility in that package.So starting with\nEuler, Cleve Molerwill explain several\nsteps that reacha really workhorse package.So that's a parallel series\nwhere you'll see the codes.This will be a\nchalk and blackboardseries, where I'll find\nsolutions in exponential form.And if I can, I would like to\nconclude the series by reachingpartial differential equations.So I'll just write some partial\ndifferential equations here,so you know what they mean.And that's a goal\nwhich I hope to reach.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So one partial\ndifferential equationwould be du dt-- you see\npartial derivatives-- issecond derivative.So I have two variables now.Time, which I always have.And here is x in\nthe space direction.That's called the heat equation.That's a very important\nconstant coefficient,partial differential equation.So PDE, as distinct from ODE.And so I write down one more.The second derivative of u\nis the same right-hand sidesecond derivative\nin the x direction.That would be called\nthe wave equation.So this is like the first\norder equation in time.It's like a big system.In fact, it's like an infinite\nsize system of equations.First order in time.Or second order in time.Heat equation.Wave equation.And I would like to also\ninclude a the Laplace equation.Well, if we get there.So those are goals for\nthe end of the series thatgo beyond some courses in ODEs.But the main goal\nhere is to give youthe standard clear picture\nof the basic differentialequations that we can\nsolve and understand.Well, I hope it goes well.Thanks.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}]
