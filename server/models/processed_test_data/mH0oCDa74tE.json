Take a look at the description for details.My own choice is considerably larger than a\n1,000,000, roughly 8\u00d710^53.For a sense of scale, that\u2019s around the\nnumber of atoms in the planet Jupiter, so it might seemcompletely arbitrary, but what I love is that\nif you were to talk with an alien civilizationor a super-intelligent AI that invented math\nfor itself without any connection to our particularculture or experiences, I think both would\nagree this number is something very peculiar and that itreflects something fundamental.What is it, exactly?Well, it\u2019s the size of the monster, but\nto explain what that means, we're gonna need to back upand talk about group theory.This field is all about codifying the idea\nof symmetry.For example, when we say a face is symmetric,\nwhat we mean, is that you can reflect it about a line, andit\u2019s left looking completely the same; it\u2019s\na statement about an action that you can take.Something like a snowflake is also symmetric, but in\nmore ways. You can rotate it 60 degrees, or120 degrees, you can flip it along various different\naxes, and all these actions leave itlooking the same.A collection of all of the actions like this taken\ntogether is called a \u201cgroup\u201d. kind of... at least...groups are typically defined more abstractly\nthan this, but we\u2019ll get to that later.Take note, the fact that mathematicians have co-opted\nsuch an otherwise generic word for this seeminglyspecific kind of collection should give you some\nsense how fundamental they find it. Also take note;we always consider the action of doing nothing\nto be part of a group, so if we include that do-nothingaction, the group of symmetries of a snowflake\nincludes 12 distinct actions.It even has a fancy name, \u201cD6\u201d.The simple group of symmetries that only has two elements acting on a face also has a fancy", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.386}, {"text": "name, \u201cC2\u201d.In general there\u2019s a whole zoo of groups,\nwith no shortage of jargon to their names,categorizing the many different ways that something\ncan be symmetric.When we describe these sorts of actions, there\u2019s\nalways an implicit structure being preserved.For example, there are 24 rotations that I can apply to a cube that leave it looking thesame, and those 24 actions taken together do indeed constitute a group.But if we allow for reflections, which is kind\nof a way of saying the orientation of thecube is not part of its structure we intend to preserve, you get a bigger group,with 48 actions in total.If you loosen things further and consider the faces to be a little less rigidly attached,maybe free to rotate and get shuffled around,you would get a much larger set of actions.And yes, you could consider these symmetries in the sense that they leave it looking the same,and all these shuffling rotating actions\ndo constitute a group,but it's a much bigger and more complicated group.The large size in this group reflects the\nmuch looser sense of structure which each actionpreserves.The loosest sense of structure is if we have\na collection of points and consider any waythat you could shuffle them, any permutation, to be a\nsymmetry of those points.Unconstrained by any underlying property that needs to be preserved, these permutation groups canget quite large.Here, it's kind of fun to flash through every possible permutation of 6 objects and see how many there are.In total, it amounts to 6!, or 720.By contrast, if we gave these points some structure, maybe making them the corners of a hexagonand only considering the permutaions that preservehow far apart each one is from the other, we get only the 12 snowflakesymmetries we saw earlier.Bump the number of points up to 12, and the\nnumber of permutations grows to about 479", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.263}, {"text": "million.The monster that we\u2019ll get to is rather\nlarge, but it\u2019s important to understandthat largeness in and of itself isn\u2019t all\nthat interesting with groups; the permutationgroups already make that easy to see.If we were shuffling 101 objects,\nfor example, with the 101 factorial differentactions that can do this, we have a group with a size of around 9\u00d710^159.If every atom in the observable universe had a copy of that universe inside itself, this isroughly how many sub-atoms there would be.These permutation groups go by the name S sub n, and they play an important role in group theory.In a certain sense, they encompass all other\ngroups.And so far you might be thinking:  \u201cok, this intellectually playful enough, but is any of thisactually useful?\u201dOne of the earliest applications of group\ntheory came when mathematicians realized thatthe structure of these permutation groups\ntells us something about solutions to polynomialequations.You know how in order to find the two roots\nof a quadratic equation, everyone learns acertain formula in school?Slightly lesser known is the fact that there\u2019s also\na cubic formula, one that involves nesting cuberoots with square roots in a larger expression.There\u2019s even a quartic formula for degree\n4 polynomial, which is an absolute mess.It's almost impossible to write without factoring things out.And for the longest time mathematicians struggled\nto find a formula to solve degree 5 polynomials.I mean, maybe there's one, but it's just super complicated.It turns out though, if you think about the group\nwhich permutes the roots of such a polynomial,there\u2019s something about the nature of this\ngroup that reveals that no quintic formulacan exist.For example, the 5 roots of the polynomial\nyou see on screen now, they have definite values,you can write out decimal approximations,but what you can never do, is write those exact values\nby starting with the coefficients of the polynomialand using only the four basic operations of arithmetic together with radicals,", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.125}, {"text": "no matter how many times you nest them.And that impossibility has everything to do\nwith the inner structure of the permutationgroup S5.A theme in math through the last two centuries\nhas been that the nature of symmetry in andof itself can show us all sorts of non-obvious\nfacts about the other objects we that we study.To give just a hint of one of the many many ways\nthis applies to physics, there\u2019s a beautifulfact known as Noether\u2019s theorem saying that\nevery conservation law corresponds to somekind of symmetry, a certain group.So all these fundamental laws like conservation\nof momentum and conservation of energyeach correspond to a group.More specifically, the actions we should be able to apply to a setup, such that the laws of physics don't change.All of this is to say that groups really are\nfundamental, and the one thing I want youto recognize right now is that they\u2019re one\nof the most natural things that you could study.What could be more universal than symmetry?So you might think the patterns among groups\nthemselves would somehow be very beautifuland symmetric.The monster, however, tells a different story.Before we get to the monster, though, at this\npoint some mathematicians might complain thatwhat I\u2019ve described so far are not groups,\nexactly, but group actions; and the groups aresomething slightly more abstract.By way of analogy, if I mention the number\n\u201c3\u201d, you probably don\u2019t think abouta specific triplet of things, you probably\nthink about 3 as an object in and of itself, anabstraction, maybe represented with a common symbol.In much the same way, when mathematicians\ndiscuss the elements of a group, they don\u2019tnecessarily think about specific actions on\na specific object, they might think of theseelements as a kind of thing in and of itself, maybe\nrepresented with symbols.For something like the number three, the abstract\nsymbol does us very little good unless we defineits relation with other numbers, for example\nthe way it adds and multiplies with them.For each of these, you could think of a literal\ntriplet of something, but again most of usare comfortable, probably even more comfortable,\nusing the symbols alone.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.133}, {"text": "Similarly, what makes a group a group are\nall the ways that its elements combine with eachother.And in the context of actions, this has a very vivid meaning; what we mean by combiningis to apply one action after the other,read from right to left; if you flip a snowflake\nabout the x-axis, then rotate it 60 degreescounterclockwise, the overall action is the\nsame as if you had flipped it about this diagonal line.All possible ways that you could combine two elements of a group like thisdefines a kind of multiplication.That is what really give a group its structure.Here, I\u2019m drawing out the full 8x8 table of the symmetries of a square.If you apply an action on the top row and follow it \nby an action from the left column, it\u2019ll bethe same as the action in the corresponding grid\nsquare.But if we replace each of these symmetric actions with something purely symbolic, well, the multiplicationtable still captures the inner structure of the\ngroup, but now it\u2019s abstracted away fromany specific object it might act on, like\na square, or roots of a polynomial.This is entirely analogous to how the usual\nmultiplication table is written symbolically,which abstracts away from the idea of literal\ncounts.Literal counts, arguably, would make it clearer what\u2019s\ngoing on, but since grade school we all growcomfortable with the symbols.After all, they\u2019re less cumbersome, they free\nus up to think about more complicated numbers,and they also free us to think about numbers in new and very different ways.All of this is true of groups as well, which are best understood, as abstractions.above the idea of symmetry actions.I\u2019m emphasizing this for two reasons, one\nis that understanding what groups really aregives a better appreciation for the monster.And the other is that many students learning about\ngroups for the first time can find them frustratinglyopaque, I know I did.A typical course starts with this very formal and abstract definition, which is that a group is a set \u2013 any", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "collection of things \u2013 with a binary operation\n\u2013 a notion of multiplication between thosethings \u2013 such that this multiplication\nsatisfies four special rules, or axioms.And all this can feel, well, kind of random,\nespecially when it isn\u2019t made clear thatall these axioms arise from the things that must be obviously true when you\u2019re thinking about actionsand composing them.To any students among you with such a course in the future, I would say if you\nappreciate that the relationship groups havewith symmetric actions is analogous to the\nrelationship numbers have with counts, itcan help to keep a lot of the course a lot more grounded.An example might help to see why this kind\nof abstraction is desirable.Consider the symmetries of a cube and the\npermutation group of 4 objects.At first, these groups feel very different;\nyou might think of the one on the left asacting on the 8 corners in a way that preserves\nthe distance and orientation structure among them,but on the right we have a completely\nunconstrained set of actions on a much smallerset of points.As it happens, though, these two groups are\nreally the same, in the sense that their multiplicationtables will look identical.Anything that you can say about one group will\nbe true of the other.For example, there are 8 distinct permutations\nwhere applying it three times in a row getsyou back to where you started (not counting\nthe identity). These are the ones that cyclethree elements together.There are also 8 rotations of a cube that\nhave this property, the various 120 degree rotationsabout each diagonal.This is no coincidence.The way to phrase this precisely is to say\nthere\u2019s a one-to-one mapping between rotationsof a cube and permutation of four elements\nwhich preserves composition.For example, rotating 180 degrees about\nthe y-axis, followed by 180 about the x-axis, givesthe same overall effect as rotating 180 degree around the z-axis; remember, that\u2019s", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "what we mean by a product of two actions.And if you look at the corresponding permutations, under a certain one-to-one association,\nthis product will still be true,applying the two actions on the leftgives the same overall effect as\nthe one on the right.When you have a correspondence where this remains true for all products, it\u2019s called an\u201cisomorphism\u201d, which is maybe the most\nimportant idea in group theory.This particular isomorphism between cube rotations\nand permutations of four objects is a bitsubtle, but for the curious among you, you\nmay enjoy taking a moment to think hard abouthow the rotations of a cube permute its four\ndiagonals.In your mathematical life, you'll see more examples of a given group arising from seemingly unrelated situations,and as you do, you\u2019ll get a better sense for what group theory is all about.Think about how a number like 3 is not really about a particular triplet of things, it\u2019s aboutall possible triplets of things.In the same way a group is not really about\nsymmetries of a particular object, it\u2019san abstract way that things even can be symmetric.There are even plenty of situations where\ngroups come up in a way that doesn\u2019t feellike a set of symmetric actions at all, just\nas numbers can do a lot more than count.In fact, seeing the same group come out of\ndifferent situations is a great way to revealunexpected connections between distinct objects;\nthat\u2019s a very common theme in modern math.And once you understand this about groups,\nit leads you to a natural question, whichwill eventually lead us to the monster: What\nare all the groups?But now you\u2019re in a position to ask that question in a more sophisticated way: Whatare all the groups up to isomorphism, which\nis to say we consider two groups to be thesame if there\u2019s an isomorphism between them.This is asking something more fundamental\nthan what are all the symmetric things, it\u2019sa way of asking what are all of the ways that\nsomething can be symmetric?Is there some formula or procedure for producing\nthem all?", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "Some meta-pattern lying at the heart of symmetry\nitself?This question turns out to be hard.Exceedingly hard.For one thing, there's the division between infinite groups, for example the ones describing the symmetriesof a line or a circle, and finite groups,\nlike all the ones we\u2019ve looked at up tothis point.To maintain some hope of sanity, let\u2019s limit\nour view to finite groups.In much the same way that numbers can be broken\ndown in their prime factorizations, or moleculescan be described based on the atoms within\nthem, there's a certain way that finite groupscan be broken down into a kind of composition of smaller groups.The ones which can\u2019t be broken down any\nfurther, analogous to prime numbers or atoms,are known as the \u201csimple groups\u201d.To give a hint for why this is useful, remember\nhow we said that group theory can be used to prove thatthere\u2019s no formula for a degree-5 polynomial\nthe way there is for quadratic equations?Well, if you're wondering what that proof actually looks like, it involves showing that if there were some kind of mythical quinticformula, something which uses only radicals\nand the basic arithmetic operations,it would imply that the permutation group on 5 elements decomposes into a special kind of simple group,known fancifully as cyclic groups of prime\norder.But the actual way that it breaks down involves a different kind of simple group, a different kind of atom,one which polynomial solutions built up from radicals\nwould never allow.That is a super high level description, of\ncourse, with about a semester\u2019s worth of detailsmissing, but the point is that you have this\nreally non-obvious fact about a differentpart of math whose solution comes down to\nfinding the atomic structure of a certaingroup.This is one of many different examples where understanding the nature of these simple groups,these atoms, actually matters outside of group theory.The task of categorizing all finite groups breaking down into two steps:One - find all the simple groups, and two - \nfind all the ways to combine them.The first question is like finding the periodic\ntable, and the second is a bit like doingall of chemistry thereafter.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "The good news is that mathematicians have\nfound all the finite simple groups..Well, more pertinent is that they proved that the ones that they found are, in fact, all theones out there.It took many decades, tens of thousands of\ndense pages of advanced math, hundreds ofsome of the smartest minds out there, and\nsignificant help from computers, but by 2004with a culminating 12,000 pages to tie\nup the loose ends, there was a definitive answer.Many experts agree: this is one of\nthe most monumental achievements in the historyof math. (sigh)The bad news, though, is that this answer is absurd.There are 18 distinct infinite families of\nsimple groups, which makes it really temptingto lean into the periodic table analogy; but\ngroups are stranger than chemistry becausethere are also 26 simple groups that are just left\nover that don\u2019t fit the other patterns.These 26 are known as the sporadic groups.That a field of study rooted in symmetry itself\nhas such a patched together fundamental structureis...
