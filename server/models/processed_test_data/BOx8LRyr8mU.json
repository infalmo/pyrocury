a\nstory that came to mind.And that was the story of\nthe foreman yelling downinto an excavation, how\nmany of you men down there?And the reply came back, three.And he said, OK, half\nof you come on up.Now with that funny\nstory, I wouldlike to launch today's lesson,\nwhich could be, I guess,sub called, or whatever\nword that you'dlike to pick, realness is\nin the eyes of the beholder,the question being, of course,\nthat when you talk about takingone half of three people, ah--well, let's put it this way.I was going to say,\nyou can't do it.Let's say, if you could\ndo it, you wouldn'tlike to see the answer.On the other hand, to\ntake three inches and say,let's divide that\ninto two equal parts,there's a case where the answer\ndoes happen to make sense.Now today, you see\nwe're going to talkabout a new phase of our course\ncalled the complex numbers.The complex numbers happen\nto be a delightful topic,from the point of view\nthat on the one hand,they offer a great deal of\nenrichment in pure mathematics,and on the other hand, they\ncontribute a great dealto our physical\nunderstanding of reality.Now to launch into this, let's\nget right into the topic.I call today's lesson,\nThe Complex Numbers.And going back to my\nopening hilarious story,what we're saying is if the\nonly numbers that we knewwere the integers and we\nwere given the equation2x equals 3--", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.188}, {"text": "and notice that in\nterms of integers,the equation makes sense,\nbecause 2 and 3 happento be integers-- we're looking\nfor to solve this equation.And the question is, does\nthis equation have a solution?The answer is it only\nhas a solution providedthat you want to invent\nnumbers which are not integers.In other words, this\ndoes not have a solutionif we insist that the\nanswer be an integer.But if we're willing to invent\na new batch of numbers calledthe fractions or the\nrational numbers,then this equation\nwill have a solution.Do we want this\nto have solutions?Well, sometimes there are\nmeaningful situations in whichit's meaningful to\nsolve this equation,other times when it isn't.Again, the story of\ngoing into the bankand into the post office and\nasking for $0.03 worth of $0.02stamps.And we can think of all sorts of\nhilarious ways of embellishingthis story.Going on further, though, let's\ntake what ultimately becameknown as the \"Real Numbers.\"And I'm going to put\nthis in quotation marks.Because even though\nthese are genuinelycalled the Real Numbers,\nthey are no more realthan the integers were real.By definition, a Real\nNumber is simply any numberwhose square is non negative.Assuming that to be the\ndefinition of real numbers,we come to the equation\nx squared equals minus 1.We say, does this\nequation have a solution?And the answer is if we\ninsist that the solution hasto be a real number,\nthe answer, obviously,is that this does\nnot have a solution.Because the definition of a\nreal number is that it's squarecannot be negative, and this\nsays that x squared is minus 1.So either we must say that\nthis equation does nothave solutions.Or if we want it\nto have solutions,we must invent an extension\nof the number system.We must extend the real\nnumbers in the same waythat if we wanted this\nequation to have a solution,we had to extend the integers.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.432}, {"text": "The extension of\nthe integers thatwas necessary to\nsolve this equationhappened to be called\nthe Rational Numbers.Let's talk about, first\nof all, whether wewant an extension\nof the real numbers,and secondly, if we do,\nwhat shall we call it,and what properties\nshall it have?To motivate why we\nwould like the equation,x squared plus 1 equals\n0 to have solutions.And that, of course,\nis just equivalent to xsquared equals minus 1.Let's go back to\nan example that weused when we first\nintroduced exponentsin part 1 of our course.We observed that one\nof the propertiesof an equation like\ny equals e to the rxwhere r is a constant is\nthat if we differentiate thiswith respect to x,\nthe r comes down.But the fact, the e\nto the rx remains.What this told us was that\nin taking derivatives,we would get powers of r.But e to the rx would remain.And we use that\ntechnique for solvingcertain types of second,\nwell, differential equations.For example, looking at the\nequation y double prime plus yequals 0, one technique would\nbe to replace y by e to the rx.When I differentiate twice, I\nhave an r squared e to the rxhere.Here is an e to the rx.The e to the rx cancels out.And I wind up with a\npolynomial equation for r.And we then solve for\nthe values of r, suchthat this would be\na solution of this.Now back in part 1, because we\ndidn't know non-real numbers.We always fixed it up so\nthat the resulting equationthat we got here would have\nreal numbers for values of r.By the way, I have chosen\nthis particular equationfor two reasons.One is, the values of r can't\nbe real when I get through here.The other is, I already know\nan answer to this problem.Remember that if you\ndifferentiate sine twice,you get minus sine.If you differentiate cosine\ntwice, you get minus cosine.Consequently, the\nsecond derivativeof sine x plus sine x is 0.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.22}, {"text": "Second derivative of cosine\nx plus cosine x is 0.So I know at least two\nsolutions to this equation,two real solutions\nto this equation,this equation has physical\nmeaning because it essentiallysays, if you think of the\nparameter as being time here,look at the second\nderivative is equal to minusthe function itself.That says that the\nacceleration isequal to minus the displacement.And that's a form of\nsimple harmonic motion.You see, what I'm\ntrying to establish hereis that this does\nhave a real solution.And the problem itself has\nreal physical significance.At any rate, if we now try\nto solve this problem usingthis technique, and\nremember, again,I can give you\nproblems where we won'tknow the answer intuitively,\nand the values of rwill still come out\nto be imaginary.I simply chose this\nproblem so that wecould correlate a\nso-called imaginary answerwith a real answer.The idea, again,\nis I differentiateeach of the rx twice.I get this.So y double prime\nplus y is this.I factor out the e to\nthe rx, which can't be 0.Therefore, it must be that\nr squared plus 1 is 0,or r is equal to plus or minus\nthe square root of minus 1.Now you see, so far, I don't\nknow what this thing means.Because there certainly\nis no real number,which has this property.Because the square of real\nnumbers have to be positive.They can't be minus 1.Let me, for the\nsake of argument,invent a number, which is equal\nto the square root of minus 1.I'll call that number i.So r is equal to\nplus or minus i.And if I now remember what\nequation I'm solving--it was y equals e to the rx--I can replace r by\neither i or minus i.So the two solutions I would get\nwould be y equals e to the ixor y equals e to the minus x.But this is bothering me.Because I really have\nno real feeling for whatI means right now.What I do know, however,\nis this, that mechanically,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.129}, {"text": "this is a solution\nto a real problem.y double prime\nplus y equals zerois a real problem,\nnot an imaginary one.And by the way, notice\nmechanically here,taking i to be a\nconstant, if we stillassume that the derivative of\ne to the x is re to the rx,even when r happens\nto be non-real,notice that if I differentiate\nthis thing twice,the first time I\ndifferentiate, I bring downan i, the second time I\ndifferentiate, I bring downan i.That gives me i squared,\nwhich is minus 1.This is going to be\nminus e to the ix.And if I add on e to the\nix, I really do get 0.Notice also, now, that I do\nknow that a real solutionof this equation is y equals\ncosine x, or also y equals sinex.So that somehow or\nother, I get the feelingthat I should exist, and more to\nthe point, that this expressione to the ix should somehow be\nrelated to sign x and cosine x.In other words, if I had\nnever been lucky enoughto invent the\ntrigonometric functions,and I want to solve the\nproblem, y double prime plus yequals 0 and wound\nup with this, thenmy feeling is, I must find\na real interpretation,a physically real interpretation\nfor each of the ix.Because I sense that my\nproblem has a solution.Again, I can take\nthe coward's way out.I can say, if it's going\nto be this much work,I don't want the problem\nto have a solution.But once I want the\nproblem to have a solution,I must extend the number system.And the upside of\nthat whole thingis that we now invent something\ncalled the Complex NumberSystem.First of all, the\ncomplex numbersare defined to be the\nset of all symbols--let's just call them\nSymbols for the time being--all symbols of the\nform x plus iy,where x and y are real numbers.And just to refresh\nour memories here,i is the symbol which\nnumerically represents", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.139}, {"text": "the square root of minus 1, OK?Notice that the X and the\ny are real numbers, though,where by Real, we mean what?The squares are non negative.Now you will recall, that\nin any mathematical system,the thing that\nyou're dealing withis more than a set of\nnumbers, it's a set of numbersor a set of objects together\nwith a structure, certain rulesthat tell us how to work with\nthese elements that make upthe set.Remember, the difference\nbetween a set and a systemis a set that's just a\ncollection of objects.The system is the\ncollection of objectstogether with how we combine\nthese objects to formsimilar objects, et cetera.And what is the\nstructure in this case?Given the two complex numbers,\nx1 plus iy1 and x2 plus iy2,we define equality to be sort\nof component by component.The real parts x1\nand x2 must be equal.And the imaginary parts-- and by\nthe way, just a word of cautionhere, the imaginary\npart of a complex numberis, by definition,\nthe coefficient of i.Notice that the imaginary\npart is itself a real number.The coefficient of i\nis the real number y1.What we're saying is we define\nthe definition of equalityfor complex numbers to be\nthat two complex numbers areequal if and only if\ntheir real parts are equaland their imaginary\nparts are equal.Secondly, we agree to add two\ncomplex numbers, componentby component, so to speak.In other words, to add\ntwo complex numbers,we add the two real parts, and\nwe add the two imaginary parts,OK?That's all this says.And thirdly, to multiply\na complex numberby a real number, we\nmultiply the real partby the given real number\nand the imaginary partby the given real number, which\nis what this third rule says.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.122}, {"text": "And all I want to\nsee from this isthat by the very\ndefinition of these threestructural properties, we\nhave made the complex numbersa two-dimensional vector space.In other words, it\nmeans that we can nowvisualize the complex\nnumbers, geometrically,in the same way that\nwe could visualizethe real numbers geometrically.Remember, geometrically-- when\nwe define the real numbersto be those numbers whose\nsquares are non negatives,we do not need any\npicture to visualize that.It just happens that the\nnumber line, the x-axis,is a very convenient\nway of visualizingreal numbers pictorially.What we're saying is that\nsince complex numbers seemto indicate a two-dimensional\nvector space, namely,real and imaginary parts\nwhich are independent,it would appear that the\nanalog for visualizingcomplex numbers pictorially\nwould be to use the plane.And that's exactly what we do.The diagram is called\nthe Argand Diagram.The idea is this.Given the complex number x\nplus iy, which we'll call z,we visualize z as\neither the pointx comma y in the xy\nplane-- in other words,notice that the x-axis\nis the real axis,meaning it denotes the real\npart of the complex number.The y-axis is called\nthe imaginary axis,because it denotes\nthe coefficient of i,the imaginary part, OK?And what we're saying is we can\nvisualize the complex number xplus iy to be the\npoint x comma y.Or for that matter,\nthe vector thatgoes from the\norigin to the pointz, whose components are x and\ny, meaning what? x plus iy.The components are the real\nand the imaginary parts here.We can translate this\ninto polar coordinates,meaning that we can measure\nthe point z by its rvalue and its theta value.But one

either\npositive or negative,the idea is that we\nwould like to identifythe absolute value\nof a complex numberwith being its distance\nfrom the origin.Since we want absolute\nvalue to be non-negative,we simply say that r is\nthe positive square rootof x squared plus y squared.And that names the magnitude\nof the complex number.The angle theta is called the\nArgument, abbreviated Arg,not to be confused with this\nfunny coincidence of Arganddiagram.This comes from the\nword Argument, argument.The angle is called the\nArgument, all right?And if you elect to\nwrite the complex numberx plus iy as r\ncomma theta, becauseof the connection between polar\nand Cartesian coordinates, r--see, x is what? x\nis r cosine theta.y is r sine theta.So the complex number\nis r cosine thetaplus ir sine theta.That's what r comma\ntheta denotes.Now using this as background--\nso we now have what?We've invented, at least\nabstractly, a system of numberscalled the Complex Numbers.And by the way, let me point\nout here that don't use the wordImaginary too strongly.There is certainly\nnothing imaginaryabout this geometric\ninterpretation.What may be imaginary\nis I may nothave a place where I want to\nuse these kind of numbers.But believe me, we wouldn't have\nmade a whole block of materialabout these numbers\nif there weren'treal interpretations of the\nso-called complex numbers.This is a perfectly real\ngeometric interpretation.So far, we have\nestablished the factthat this interpretation\ngives us a vector space.But the complex numbers have an\nadditional structure as well,namely, if I saw the two complex\nnumbers, a plus bi times--", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.165}, {"text": "and c plus di, and I multiplied\nthem-- remember now, a, b, c,and d are real--I would

ac.bi times di should be\nbd times i squared,if the ordinary rules of\narithmetic are to apply.Since i squared is minus 1,\nthis term becomes minus bd.Since a, c, b, and\nd are real numbers,this is a real number, right?Correspondingly, the\ncoefficient of-- the multiplierof i, the coefficient of\ni is what? bc plus ad,which is also a real number.So if we make up this\ndefinition of multiplicationfor complex numbers,\nwe have made surethat the rules of arithmetic\nfor complex numbersparallel the rules\nfor real numbers.And by the way,\nit's very importanthere to make the aside that\nthis is a crucial result.Notice that among\nthe complex numbers,the real numbers are\nincluded, namely,thinking of it geometrically,\nif you look at the plane,the real numbers\nare those pointsin the plane which\nlie along the x-axis.It's the same as saying that\nwhen you extended the integersto form the rational numbers,\nthe rational numbers includedthe integers.In other words, if I\nlook at the number 3,I can think of it\nas the integer 3.I could also think of it as the\nratio 3 divided by 1, you see?And therefore, I\nwould like whateverrules I have for\nthe complex numbersto remain valid if the complex\nnumbers happen to be real.It would be terrible to\nhave two different rulesfor multiplication,\none for real numbersand one for complex\nnumbers, and thengiven two real numbers,\nwhen I multiply them,I get one answer if I think\nof them as being real,and another answer if I think\nof them as being complex.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.138}, {"text": "At any rate, the

plus to a minus.Notice that we would get what?The sum and difference\nhere gives us the sumof difference of two squares.It's going to be what? a squared\nminus b squared i squared.But since i squared is minus\n1, minus b squared i squaredis minus b squared times minus\n1, which is plus b squared.And notice, therefore, if\nyou multiply a plus bi, whichis a complex number, by this\nother complex number, a minusbi, you get a squared\nplus b squared,which is a non-negative\nreal number.In particular, if you think back\nto the geometric interpretationof this, the point a plus bi\nin the plane is a comma b.And the distance of a\ncomma b from the originis the square root of a\nsquared plus b squared.So this product is\nactually the squareof the magnitude, the\nabsolute value of a plus bi.This little gizmo\nis so importantthat it's given a special name.By definition, given\nany complex number z,written in the form x plus iy,\nthe complex conjugate of z,called z bar--not to be confused with a z with\na bar underneath that we wereusing to denote vectors--\nbut the complex conjugatez bar is what you get by just\nchanging the plus sign hereto a minus.In other words, the complex\nconjugate of x plus iyis x minus iy.And geometrically,\nall this meansis, you see, when you change\nthe sign of the imaginary part,", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.291}, {"text": "remember, the imaginary\npart is the y-axis.You're just reflecting\nthe number symmetricallywith respect to the x-axis.You're leaving the\nx-coordinate alone.And you're changing the\ny-coordinate to minus y.In polar

of the many applications\nof complex conjugates--I'll give you some of\nthese other applicationsin the exercises.But for now, what I\nthink is importantis a simple one that\nessentially shows ushow we find the quotient\nof two complex numbers.Quite simply, sparing\nyou the details,if I have c plus di\ndivided by a plus bi,I simply multiply\nnumerator and denominatorby the complex conjugate\nof the denominator, OK?What will that do for me?Well, when I multiply the\ntwo factors in the numerator,I'm going to get a real\npart, namely, ac plus bd.In other words, it's\nminus bd i squared.But i squared is minus 1.So I'm going to get ac plus bd.I'm going to get an imaginary\npart, which is ad minus bc.But the denominator will just\nbe a squared plus b squared,which is a real number.In other words, what\nthis tells me isI can now write the quotient of\ntwo complex numbers in the formwhat--a real number plus i\ntimes a real number.In fact, the only\ntime I can't do this--I have to be careful.a or b must be unequal to 0.Because if both\nand b are 0, thisis a 0 denominator, which\nI don't allow myselfto divide by.And the only way\nboth a and b can be 0is if the complex number is 0\nplus 0i, which is the number 0.So I'm saying, again, just\nlike in the real case,I still can't divide by 0.Anyway, to give you a more\npractical illustration to seethis with numbers-- not\npractical, but, at least,concrete--", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.567}, {"text": "3 plus 2i divided by 4 plus\ni, I simply multiply numeratorand denominator by 4 minus i.You see, what that\ndoes

quotient, 3\nplus 2i times 4 plus i,is 14/17 plus 5/17 i.And by the way, as a\ntrivial check, and youcan do this if you\nwish for an exercise,simply take the answer\nthat we got here,multiply it by the\ndenominator, 4 plus ihere, and actually check\nthat that product comes outto be 3 plus 2i.At any rate, this use\nof complex conjugatesshows us that when you\ndivide two complex numbers,the result will be\na complex number,except for division by 0.You see, that's what went\nwrong with our integer problem,2x equals 3.The reason that we couldn't\nsolve it is that to solve 2xequals 3 required that\nthe process of takingthe quotient of two integers,\nand the quotient of twointegers did not have\nto be an integer.Notice on the other\nhand, that the quotientof two real numbers\nis a real number,as long as the\ndenominator is not 0.And the quotient of\ntwo complex numbersis a complex number,\nexcept for division by 0.While we're talking\nabout multiplication,a very enlightening\nthing happensif we think of multiplication\nin terms of polar coordinates,namely, take the two numbers,\nwhich in polar coordinates,are r1 comma theta 1\nand r2 comma theta 2.Now again, remember\nfrom our Argand diagramwhat it means to say that\nthe complex number haspolar coordinates\nr1 comma theta 1.Remember, the complex number is\nwritten in the form x plus iy.The x-coordinate is\nr1 cosine theta

we're sayingis what?This is the complex\nnumber whose magnitudeis r1 r2 and whose argument\nis theta 1 plus theta 2.And putting these two steps\ntogether, what it saysis that to multiply two complex\nnumbers, the same definitionof multiplication\nthat we were usingbefore, if we interpret this\nin terms of polar coordinate,it says, look at, to multiply\ntwo complex numbers [INAUDIBLE]lengths, you simply do what?Multiply the two lengths\nto get the resultinglength of the product and add\nthe two arguments, the twoangles.That's a rather\ninteresting result.You see, for example,\nif we now wantto think of the complex\nnumbers as being vectors,this gives us a\nthird vector productthat we had never\ntalked about before", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.543}, {"text": "and which I'll reinforce\nin the learning exercises.The idea is that\nusing this as a model,and here's another\nreal application,why not define a new product\nof two vectors obtainedby multiplying the two

product\nand the cross productfor complex numbers.Because after all, they are\nviewed as vectors in the plane.But again, we have no great\npractical application for this.So we don't bother doing it.By the way, just\nfor kicks here, Ithought you might\nenjoy the asidethat this little\ninteresting result explainswhy the product of two negative\nnumbers happen to be positive.Remember a negative\nnumber, if r has to-- see,a negative number\nlies on the real axis.And if r has to\nbe positive, thatmeans you're measuring\nin the directionof the negative x-axis, which\nmeans that the polar angle is180 degrees.If you multiply two\nnumbers whose anglesare 180 degrees, if you add\nthe two angles, you get what?360 degrees.You see what I'm\ndriving at here?In other words, if I multiply\ntwo numbers in polar form, eachof whose angles is\n180, the productwill have the angle\nequal to 360, you see?And that puts you back on\nthe positive real axis.And so you have such\nreal interpretationsas y in terms of\ncomplex numbers,we can explain very nicely what\nit means for the product of twonegatives to be a positive.By the way, we can\ncarry this resultfurther if we had n factors\nwritten in polar form.Then to multiply\nthese n factors,we would simply, by\ninduction, so to speak,multiply the n magnitudes\ntogether and add the n angles.And a very interesting special\ncase is if all of the factorshappen to be equal--\nin other words,if we want to raise the complex\nnumber written in polar form", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.446}, {"text": "as r comma theta

happens,\nand you're really goingto see some nice applications.At any rate, by the way, the\npolar form of multiplicationthat leads to a very\ninteresting way of extractingroots of complex numbers.For example, suppose I want\nto find the sixth root of i.In other words,\nwhat complex number,raised to the sixth\npower, gives i?In fact, is there\nsuch a complex number?After all, we could raise\nreal numbers to powers.But one of the\nreasons that we hadto invent the complex numbers\nis that we couldn't extract", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.458}, {"text": "the square root of minus 1.There was no real number\nwhose square was minus 1.The question now is\nthere a complex number,which when raised to the\nsixth power, equals i?One way of doing\nthis is to say, OK,let's assume there\nis a complex number.We'll call it x plus iy, which\nwhen raised to the sixth power,equals i.In other words, the sixth\nroot the i is x plus iy.And let's see if we\ncan solve for x and y.One way of doing this is\nto raise both sides hereto the sixth power,\nin which casewe see that i has to be x\nplus iy to the sixth power.On the other hand, i is\nwritten as 0 plus 1i.If I raise this to\nthe sixth power,I don't know if\nyou've noticed this,every time I raise i to an even\npower, I get a real number.Why?Because i squared is minus 1.Therefore, i to the fourth\nis i squared squared, whichis minus 1 squared, which is 1.i to the sixth is i\nto the fourth timesi squared, which is 1 times\ni squared, which is minus 1.And in the same way, if I\ntake i cubed, that's what?i squared times i,\nwhich is minus i.In other words, the even\npowers of i are real,the odd powers of i give\nme back plus or minus i.So if I raise this to the\nsixth power and collect terms,I'll get a certain\nnumber of real termsand a certain number of\npurely imaginary terms.In fact, using the\nbinomial theoremand raising this\nto the sixth powerand separating the terms\nfor you in advance,I wind up with what?x to the sixth plus 6x\nto the fifth iy plus 15xto the fourth iy squared plus\n20x cubed iy cubed plus 15xsquared iy to the\nfourth plus 6x iyto the fifth plus\niy to the sixth.I went through that rapidly.It's just using the\nbinomial theorem,noticing that all of these\nterms will turn out to be real.All of these terms will\nbe purely imaginary.In other words,\ngetting rid of the i's", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.459}, {"text": "to the best of my ability.See, squaring over here, this\nis a minus y squared term.This is just y to the fourth.This is i to the sixth, which\nis the same as i squared.Because i to the fourth is 1.i to the sixth is i fourth times\ni squared, which is i squared.So this just comes out\nas minus 1, et cetera.And making these\ntranslations, we wind upwith the complicated algebraic\nsystem that to find x and y,we must be able to solve\nthis system of equations.In other words, the\nroot part must be 0,the imaginary part\nmust be 1, all right?Now at this stage of\nthe game, not onlymay it seem difficult\nto solve this,but it may be that there are\nno real values of x and ywhich solve this.And if I can't find\nx and y, if thereare no values for x and\ny, it means that x plus iydoesn't exist.Well, here's where I wanted to\nshow you the tremendous powerof polar coordinates.You see, in polar coordinates,\nhow would I write i?I is what?It's magnitude is 1.See, it's the 0.0 comma\n1 in the Argand diagram.It's magnitude is 1.And it's argument is pi over 2.By the way, again, I'm in this\ntrouble with multiple angles.You see, it's only pi over 2.It could be 5 pi over 2,\n9 pi over 2, et cetera.Every time I go through 2 pi,\nI come back to the same point.I'm going to mention\nthat in a moment.But the idea is, look\nat, this is what I want.This is i.And I want the\n[INAUDIBLE] divide.Let's assume that\nthe answer can bewritten in polar coordinates.If I write it in\npolar coordinates,the answer is r comma theta.All I've got to do now\nis solve for r and theta.And I claim, believe it or\nnot, that that's trivial,namely, given this, I raise\nboth sides to the sixth power.If I do that, I wind up\nhere with i, which just,to get this all on one\nline, I just repeat this.This is 1 comma pi over\n2 in polar coordinates.And this is r comma\ntheta to the sixth power.", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.346}, {"text": "But the beauty of multiplication\nin polar coordinatesis that r comma theta\nto the sixth poweris r to the sixth comma 6 theta.The magnitude is this--so in other words, you\nmultiply the magnitudes,and you add the angles.Therefore, what this tells me\nis, remember, r must be real.There is only one\nreal number, whichwhen raised to the\nsixth power, is 1.And that's 1 itself.See, the n-th root of\nany positive numberhas exactly one real solution.That's why we can\nalways find the r.In this case, I picked\nthe simple examplewhere r turns out to be 1.See, minus 1 also raised\nto the sixth power is 1.But that doesn't count.Because we agreed that\nr had to be positive.r was measuring the magnitude\nof the complex number,so r must be 1 by\nvirtue of the factthat r is greater\nthan or equal to 0.That eliminates minus 1.Now 6 theta can either\nbe pi over 2 or 5 piover 2, et cetera.The important point being that\nwe now tack on the 2 pi k.Because notice that as this\nchanges by 360 degrees,theta only changes\nby 60 degrees.Because 6 theta is\nchanging by 360.Therefore, you see, we're going\nto get a whole bunch of thetavalues that work this way.And again, I'll explain\nthis in more detailas we go through the\nexercises on this unit.But the idea is what?If I keep tacking on multiples\nof 2 pi, what I'm sayingis r must be 1,\nand theta is what?It's pi over 12 plus what?2 pi k over 6 pi over\n3k, 60 [INAUDIBLE]..I essentially, in\nterms of angles,tack on 60 degree\nincrements here.To make a long story\nshort, r must be 1.But theta could either be\npi over 12, 5 pi over 12,9 pi over 12, 13 pi over 12.", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.372}, {"text": "See, I'm adding on 4 pi over\n12 each time, pi over 3,60 degrees, in degree measure.17 pi over 12, 21 pi over 12.The next one would\nbe 25 pi over 12.But I hope you can\nsee that that'sthe same as, position-wise,\n1 comma pi over 12gives me the same thing\nas 1 comma 25 pi over 12.But all six of these angles\ngive me different positions.Just by way of\nillustration, pi over 12turns out to be 15 degrees.What this says is that\none of the six roots of i,geometrically, is what?It's that complex number, which\nis 1 unit from the origin.That means it's on the\ncircle of radius 1,centered at the origin.And the angle must\nbe 15 degrees.The argument is 15 degrees.And by the way,\njust to check thisout that this really is\nat 1 comma pi over 12really is an answer here.How do you raise a\ncomplex number to a powerif we view it as a length?To raise this to\nthe sixth power,we must raise 1 to\nthe sixth power.That will still be 1.So I'm still going\nto be on the circle.When I multiply, I add angles.So when I raise this\nto the sixth power,I'm taking, what, 15 degrees\nsix times is 90 degrees.And that puts me right up\nwhere i is supposed to be.In other words, to this\nthing backwards, so to speak,I know that 6 times the angle\nI'm looking for must be 90.So the angle itself must be 15.For example, if I was looking\nfor the eighth root of i,I would do what?I would know that when I add\nthe angle to itself 8 times,I want 90.So the angle would have\nhad to been 90 over 8.And again, I'll leave\nthis for you as exercises.The point is that geometrically,\nthe sixth roots of iare all equally spaced points.The first one is the\npoint 1 comma pi over 12.", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.362}, {"text": "And the rest are spaced equally\nalong the circle at 60 degreeintervals.You see, it breaks the circle\nup into six equal parts.I come back to here.Notice that, for\nexample, if I takethis one, which is 75

this\ngeometrically, I'll pick--of these six, one\nof these happensto be very easy,\nat least, to me.9 pi over 12 is 3\npi over 4, whichhappens to be 135 degrees.And i-- 1 comma 3 pi over 4\nis cosine 3 pi over 4 plus isine 3 pi over 4.The cosine of 3 pi over 4 is\nminus 1 over square root of 2.The sine is plus 1\nover square root of 2.So in typical x plus iy\nform, one of the rootsis 1 over the square root\nof 2 times minus 1 plus i.In other words, the real part of\nthis complex number is minus 1over the square root of 2.The imaginary part is 1\nover the square root of 2.And I leave it,

particular example.But this would have\nworked for any rootsthat I wanted to extract.And this is very important from\na mathematical point of view.The complex numbers are\nclosed, with respectto extracting roots.And let me summarize that\nfor a part of today's lessonover here.The idea is that\none of the reasonsthat we had to invent the\nfractions after we knewthe integers was the fact that\nthe integers were not closedwith respect to division, that\nthe quotient of two integersdidn't have to be an integer.", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.425}, {"text": "One of the reasons that we
