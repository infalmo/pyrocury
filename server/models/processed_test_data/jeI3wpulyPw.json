doing stuff at a deskand thinking about hard\nproblems when sitting at a desk,but there's no emotions to\nmanage other than depression.So flying combines everything.You might be a\nlittle bit

bein the air for tens\nof thousands of years.And we think that--well, we feel lucky\nto be some of the fewwho are able to control our\nown destiny through the air.So now, it's time for questions.While you're formulating\nyour brilliant questions,enjoy these photos which I\nsnapped at the Reno air races,where the Blue Angels\nobviously already visited.AUDIENCE: What's the\n[INAUDIBLE] on the airplane?[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR 1: So what why do\nyou have both AC power and DCpower on a big jet?Big jets, the\nflight controls aretoo heavy to be\noperated by a human,so you need hydraulic power.Basically, there may still\nbe steel cables going outto the flight controls,\nbut they're justmodulating hydraulic pressure.How do you generate\nhydraulic pressure?There's a big motor to\npump the hydraulics,and it's easier to run a\nbig motor with AC powercompared to DC power, and the\nengines are also spinning.So if you just think\nabout Maxwell's equations,it's simpler to run AC for\nthat, and also, of course, youcan have higher voltage\nand transform it down.And then for the electronics,\nDC power is what they want.So that's why the DC's in there,\nto run radios and so
