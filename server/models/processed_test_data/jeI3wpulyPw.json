That's a good number. For the MIT folks, how many of you are undergrads? OK. That's a good number. How many of you are graduate students? It's an even larger number, and how many of you are neither? You're just like an MIT alumni or staff. Just a few, OK, great. Well, welcome, all of you. PROFESSOR 1: And let's just go through the goals. Let's see who's in the room.

So your course objectives are to get ready for your official FAA Knowledge Test. This is sometimes called the written test as opposed to the practical test or the check ride that you do at the end of your flight training. It's available in a bunch of different versions, including for airplanes and helicopters. We're going to concentrate in this class on airplane, partly because of the show of hands. You will also be prepared though for the FAA's remote pilot test, if you decide to go direct entry into the world of commercial drones. We hope that this is also going to help you. Any kind of thorough study usually helps you make more efficient use of your in-aircraft time. And cause we have Tina here, with her PhD in aero-astro, you're going to learn something about the engineering as well. So what is great about aviation? People were dreaming about flying a long time ago going back to the ancient Greeks. Only recently, we've been able to do it which is a good thing. One thing I like about it is to look at the geology and the organization of human settlement on the planet.

Also, everybody at MIT is pretty good at doing stuff at a desk and thinking about hard problems when sitting at a desk, but there's no emotions to manage other than depression. So flying combines everything. You might be a little bit afraid. It's not natural to be up in the air. So you're working all of your human capacities at one time. You're managing your fear, you're working your brain to think about what's coming next, and you're also working your muscles. Finally, you can get to the beach quickly, but as I note here, most places, unfortunately little airplanes when you factor in the weather and all the training that you have to do, a lot of times, you could've gotten door-to-door faster.

Lawrence was saying, he's a PhD student in aerospace engineering and has learned all the theory, and so it's a natural step to want too go and do it yourself. That's great. PROFESSOR 1: All right. Can you do it? Yes, as in fact appears on the slide here, there are a whole bunch of little airports near us, and we'll show them on a subsequent slide. They all have flight schools, and you can rent either airplanes or helicopters or both, as well as find an instructor to teach you. You can actually learned to fly in about 10 hours. To me, it's a little bit unfortunate that so much emphasis is placed on getting a pilot's certificate, because it is an independent achievement to actually be able to take off, cruise around, and land without the instructor having to touch anything. So that achievement, unfortunately, isn't recognized with a little certificate, but that's actually learning to fly.

So here's our local area, and watch this fancy device here. Whoa. So we're somewhere between Logan Airport on the bottom right and Hanscom Field which is surrounded by dashed blue line, telling you it's a towered airport. So those are the two closest airports, I think. Norwood is just about as close. I'll show that right here on the lower left of the figure. These airports that are in a magenta color, those don't have control towers. Over here is Beverly, and here's Lawrence. I think we've covered the airports that MIT folks most normally fly out of, but there's also Nashua not too far away. So you're surrounded by airports, even if Logan is the one that you're most familiar with. Hanscom Field is the most substantial of the airports.

All right. So this is a picture from that flight to Bar Harbor. Just grab the clicker for me. Thanks. So if you were to drive, we took off just, as Phillip was describing, one of the nearby airports is at Hanscom. So we took off from Hanscom. If you were to drive, it would be a 4 1/2 hour drive to get there and back. So it wouldn't really be something that you could easily do as a day trip, but since we were flying, it was a great day trip. So we flew up along the coast all the way to Bar Harbor, and what was really great about that is that we could go hiking. So all these folks flew in little airplanes from the Boston area through the MIT flying club, and we all flew up to the Bar Harbor, Maine. And then we went hiking in the Acadia woods and forests, and it was really beautiful, wonderful day, and then we flew back and landed just after sunset back here.

But more importantly, so people who-- I just came back from Bentonville, Arkansas, and there's a guy there who's the grandson of Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart. So he can pretty much do anything he wants, and what does he like to do? He has a couple P51 Mustangs. He was flying alongside this little game Verde aerobatic plane that we were testing out. He's got a super Corsair. There were only 10 built. He started as a little flight school at the local airport. He flies his little Phemon 300 business jet all over the world. So I think that's a proof that flying is fun, because people who could do anything that they want to do also fly. You're going to meet people from all around the world of all different ages.

I'm taking mine back. I thought that she was on air, but she's not. OK. So this is me. I was class of 82 at MIT. It was much more challenging then than it is for you guys. That's because the Wisconsin ice sheet was covering the campus to a depth of about 100 feet. So we had to tunnel our way from East Campus into the main buildings. I've been flying since 2002. I'm an instructor at East Coast Aero Club at Hanscom Field. I was also a regional jet pilot. I decided to learn to fly jets, and there's no better way to do that than at the airlines.

PROFESSOR 2: An F-18, so what's really cool is that this airport that I fly out of, Hanscom, is also a military Air Force Base. Which is really exciting, because upon occasion, you'll actually see military jets come out. And they, of course, did not wait for me, even though I was first in line. They nicely cut in front. They called themselves jet 1 and jet 2, and they went out. And it really looked like they didn't take any space at all, any of the runway length to take off.

So a little bit of background. So I'm also aero-astro, just like you, Lawrence, and so I studied Course 16 here. I did my undergrad in 2009, and I was really passionate about it and continued on. And I did the MIT System Design and Management Program for my master's degree and then continued on in an interdepartmental PhD across Aero-Astro Engineering Systems and Sloan. It was a really great experience. One of the things that got me really excited about it is that, when I was an undergrad in the Course 16 department, we were developing a satellite, and we needed to test that satellite. So we actually got to go on a zero gravity flight. So I don't know, has anyone heard of a zero gravity flight or the Vomit Comet? All right. So a couple of folks didn't raise their hands. So the idea is that the plane flies in a parabolic trajectory. And much like a roller coaster, when you're at the top of the parabola, or the top of the roller coaster, you know how your stomach feels like it's lifting? All right, we're getting some head nods. The rest of you guys really need to go on a roller coaster. So when you get that, you can actually, when an airplane flies like that, you can have everyone inside the airplane float up", "start": 810.0, "heat": 0.181}, {"text": " and have that sensation of zero gravity, or microgravity. It lasts about 30 seconds, and that's also how they filmed certain movies, like Apollo 13, to show the astronauts in weightlessness. So we use that to test our satellite. So it was a really great experience. It got me really excited about things, and then I felt very similar to you, that I wanted to see the theory in action, and so I became a pilot. In terms of my professional career, I developed electronic warfare systems. I went on to Raytheon. I was the chief engineer of a $40 million advanced radar and electronic warfare system. Now, I'm into entrepreneurship and have my own company in the security space. And I've been a pilot since 2012, and I love flying with the MIT Flying Club. And I'm currently working on my IFR.

We're giving you the highlights that are in the books, and passing is 70 on the test. All right. Optional supplies, just for your reference, if you study a typical flight student, a lot of them will have a non-FAA textbook. It's not necessary, but some people like the different perspective. There's a free online one that we reference later that is written by a PhD physicist which is kind of interesting. A lot of people have in hard copy a big, thick book called FAR/AIM with the regulations and the FAA's overall guidance on how to use airports and electronic navigation. There are test preparation books that you can get and electronic versions of this that just give you sample tests. You're going to use one of the websites from the King Schools. It's a popular vendor for those. And then before your check ride, you'll be reading the Airman Certification Standards. FAA still use this sexist language. There's airman and airmen for all pilots, and this is tells you what you need to demonstrate when you're getting your final check. Most people will also buy their own personal headset.

The process, a lot of people wonder, well, how do I get my private pilot's license. You need the flight training. You apply for student pilot certificate on an FAA website. I don't know if that's still running completely. I just renewed the registration for an aircraft, so that part of the FAA is running. I don't know if they're sending out Student Pilot Certificates during the shutdown or not. You have to do one medical exam in your life at least with an aviation doctor who's been blessed by the FAA, and you get your third class medical. After, eventually, you'll be able just to go to your regular doctor, if you want. Then, you take this knowledge test, and that's what you're being prepped for in this class. And finally, you'll do your practical exam with an FAA-designated examiner, one of whom should actually be here tomorrow. So you can ask him how he tortures people on the check ride. Actually, I had to take one-- you have to do a lot of these steps over again, when you do a type rating for a new aircraft. So when I worked at the airline, the oral, there is a guy who is famously harsh. And he would keep people who were trying to fly the Canadair Regional Jet in knots for hours and have them sweating during the oral exam. And the first question he asked me, the airplane has these hydraulic pumps. They're AC motors, and it has the engines generating the AC", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.115}, {"text": " power. But a lot of stuff runs on DC, and I'd really wondered about the electrical systems of the airplane. So I called up a friend of mine. It's a physics professor at UC Berkeley, and we had a one-hour discussion about when it made sense to generate AC and pipe that around the airplane and high voltage versus low voltage and DC. And so I hung up and said goodbye to my friend, Joel. And then a few weeks later, there was the oral exam, and the first question the guy asked me was-- and I'd put on my resume that I just had a bachelor's degree. I didn't list any of my other degrees. I have a PhD in AAS, it happens. So this guy who is the bane of all the pilots at this Delta subsidiary, he said, Philip, why does the airplane have both an AC and a DC system?

Didn't ask me a single other question. All right. So let's do the part that we should have done earlier. Now, at least, I know how to put on the mic.

So as we said, sometimes it's called the written. That is the knowledge-based exam. So that is what, ideally, you'll be prepared to pass with flying colors. So it's a computer-based multiple choice exam. They usually give you about 2 1/2 hours, and you don't necessarily need the whole time.

Phillip can actually endorse your log book, or you can actually print out a log book and endorse you to take that written exam. So just following the course, the final exam of this course, will be a practice a exam, and so you can take that. You can actually take it as many times as you want in order to pass, but hopefully, you don't have to take it too many times.

So most East Coast Aero Club-- I'm an instructor there-- most of the people that I've seen will skim through at least the FAA books about three times before they take the test.

Why is frost considered hazardous to flight? OK. Who thinks it's A? Who thinks it's B? All right. Who thinks it's C. All right, good job, guys. Just generally, icing, bad for a plane.

Big jets, the flight controls are too heavy to be operated by a human, so you need hydraulic power. Basically, there may still be steel cables going out to the flight controls, but they're just modulating hydraulic pressure. How do you generate hydraulic pressure? There's a big motor to pump the hydraulics, and it's easier to run a big motor with AC power compared to DC power, and the engines are also spinning. So if you just think about Maxwell's equations, it's simpler to run AC for that, and also, of course, you can have higher voltage and transform it down.
