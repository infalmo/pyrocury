a few announcements.A few of you came to us asking\nabout the grading for the term.And some feel the problem sets\nmay be on the difficult side,and some of you haven't done\nall of them, and some of youhave done more.So we just want to let you know\nthat the most important thingto us in grading is really\nyou show your effort in termsof learning.And we purposely\nmade the problemsets more difficult\nthan the lecture,so you can-- if you want to\ndig in deeper so you havethe opportunity to learn more.But by no means we\nexpect you to finishor feel easy in solving\nall the problem sets.So I just want to\nput you at easethat if that's your\nconcern, that's definitely--you don't need to\nworry about it.And we will be really just\nevaluating your effort.And based on what do\nwe observed so far,we actually believe every single\none of you is doing quite well.So you shouldn't worry about\nyour performance at the class.So continue to do a good job\non your class participation,and do some of the problem sets.And then you will be in\nfine shape for your grade.So that's all of that.So without any\nfurther delay, letme introduce my colleague,\nDoctor Stephen Blythe.", "start": 0.0,

speaking, actually,\nat almost exactlythe 20th anniversary of\nsomething very important.So on the 19th of October,\n1993, which I guessmight be the birthday\nof some of you,but almost exactly 20 years\nago, Congress voted 264 to 159--I actually remember the count\nof the vote-- to do something.So anybody like\nto guess what theyvoted to do on the 19th\nof October, 1993 thatmight be tangentially\nrelevant to financeand quantitative finance?Anyone here from HMC is\nnot allowed to answer.Anybody-- any guesses?Any ideas at all coming\nto people's minds?AUDIENCE: Was it\nGramm-Leach-Bliley?STEPHEN BLYTHE: No.AUDIENCE: Commodity\nFutures Modernization Act?STEPHEN BLYTHE:\nNo, but good guess.But actually, that is actually\ntoo related to finance,actually.This is actually--\nwasn't actuallydirectly financially\nrelated, so thatwas related to [INAUDIBLE].Anybody else think about?What does Congress usually do?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].[LAUGHTER]STEPHEN BLYTHE: No,\nno ideas whatsoever?What do you think\nCongress did 20 years ago?", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "They voted to do something.OK, well, what\nCongress do usuallyis they cut money for

guesses-- no\nguesses whatsoever?I've got to take this up\nthe road to Harvard Square,and say I've taught at MIT.No one had any guesses with\nthis question-- one guess,actually, the gentleman here.What did they cancel the\nfinancing for in 1993?I'll say it was the\nSuperconducting SuperCollider underneath Texas\njust south of Dallas.So $2 billion had been\nspent on the Super Collider.And the budget had\nexpanded from, I think,$6 to $11 billion.So they, by canceling, had\na $9 billion dollar savings.This is 20 years\nago-- almost exactly.And as a result of that--\none result of that-- was,of course, the academic\njob market for physicistscollapsed overnight.And two of my roommates\nwere theoretical physicistsat Harvard.And they basically realized\ntheir job prospects in academiahad vaporized\ninstantaneously that day.And both of them,\nwithin six months,had found jobs with\nGoldman Sachs in New York.And they catalyzed they--\nthey and the cohort--they're called the\nSuperconducting Super Collidergeneration.If you ever wondered why people\nlike myself and like Jake gotPhDs in quantitative subjects\naround the turn of-- around1990 to 1993-- all ended\nup in a

the Higgs Bosonand get a Nobel Prize--\nmaybe we're getting reversal.But anyway, we're\nstill in finance.I've, as Jake mentioned,\nwell, I did mention,I was originally in academics.I was actually a mathematics\nfaculty member in Londonwhen I got my PhD-- I\ngot my PhD from Harvard.And in 1993, I was an academic.And all my friends-- I\nsaw them go to finance.So I followed them, spent\na career in

bit by bit.Anyway, that is the\nbook of my class.And the genesis of\nthe class was reallythat, when I've\nbeen on Wall Street,and I was a colleague\nof Jake's at MorganStanley in this rapidly growing\nquantitative finance field,we encountered on the trading\ndesk in the late 1990sand the early 2000s problems\nfrom the real economy-- thingsthat we had to trade.We were-- things that were\ncoming to us on the tradingdesk that required subtle\nunderstanding of the underlyingtheory.So that we, in essence, we\nbuilt theoretical frameworkto solve the problems\nthat were givento us by the financial markets.So that period, especially\naround the turn of the century,there's a big growth in\nderivatives markets, which--options, futures,\nforwards, et cetera, swaps.And we needed to build\ntheoretical toolsto tackle them.And that's really what the\ncourse was evolved out of,to build the appropriate\ntheoretical framework,motivated by the\nproblems we encountered.Why I enthuse\nabout the subject--and I really like\nteaching the subject--is that there is an impression\nthat qualitative finance isa very arcane and contrived\nsubject-- just a wholebunch of PhDs on Wall Street\ncoming up with crazy ideas.And they need\ncomplicated mathematicsthat's just complicated\nfor the sake of complexity.And the theory is just\nsort of a contrived theory.But in fact, at the\nheart of Wall Street", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.116}, {"text": "is that the real economy\ndemands some of these productsby supply and demand.There are actual,\nreal participantsin the financial

theory that comes outof it, and in particular the\napproach I take here, I thinkis just very elegant.OK, so there's some subtlety\nand elegance and beautyto the underlying\ntheory that comes outof addressing real problems.This course, and the way\nthat I teach finance,is very probability centric.You probably realize from the\nlectures you've seen alreadyin this class, there are\nmany different approaches,many different methods that are\nused in finance-- stochasticcalculus, partial differential\nequations, simulation,and so on.The classical derivation\nof Black-Scholesis, well, it's the\nsolution of the PDE.OK, that has appealed to people.In fact, this is\nwhy in some ways,quantitative finance\nis a broad church,because whether you're a\nphysicist, or probabilist,or a chemical engineer, all\nthe techniques you learncan be applied.You know stochastic calculus.You know differential equations.They can be applied.But the path that I\ntake in this classis very much through the\nprobabilistic route, whichis my background as\na probabilist, asan academic, or a\nstatistician as an academic.And this is, in particular,\nI think, a very elegant pathto understand finance,\nand the linkagebetween derivative\nproducts-- whichmight seem contrived-- and\nprobability distributions,which is sort of natural\nthings for probabilists.So this, what we're going\nto talk about today,is really this\nlink, which I calloption-probability duality.Which, in essence, in the\nsimplest form, is just saying,option prices-- they're just\nprobability distributions.", "start": 600.0, "heat":

that point\nwhere we see this duality doesnot need a whole framework\nand infrastructureof complicated definitions,\nor formulae, or option pricingformulae, or so on.So that's what I'm going to\ntry and do in this hour or so,is introduce this concept\nof option price, probabilityduality.And show how the\nnatural-- so there'sa natural duality\nthat can be seenin a number of different ways.OK, so we're going to need\na few definitions thatshould be familiar to you.We're going to\ndefine three assets.We have a call option,\nwhich we know about,a zero-coupon bond--\ncalled a zed cee bee.This is the one thing I\nhaven't become Americanized on.I still call this zed.It's a-- other\nthings I've become--and then a digital option.OK, all right, so what are they?Well, they're all going to\nbe defined by their payoutsat maturity.OK, so we're going to have\nsome maturity capital T,and some underlying asset, S,\nthe stock, with some price S_T.OK, so we know that the call\noption has payout at T--So that's called\npayout at T.

So here,T is the maturity.K is the strike.So T maturity, K is strike.And these are three assets.So this is, in some sense,\nthe payout function.All derivative\nproducts can be definedin terms of a function--\nnot all of them.Many derivative products\ncan be defined justas a function of S_T.And here are three functions\nof S_T.

I'm just going to\nintroduce notation.Every different finance book\nuses different notation, sojust C for call price,\nwith strike K, at little twith maturity big T.\nOK, just that notation.The zero-coupon bond--\nthe price at little t--let's call that Z. That's\nthe price of little t.And the digital--\nwe'll just call that D.So this is what we're\ngoing to set this up.Actually, you could have\na whole lecture on whynotation-- different notation.K and capital T are\nactually embeddedin the terms of the contract.Little t is in my calendar time.So you might think why\ndon't you put K and capital", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "T somewhere else?Well, when you get actually\nto modeling derivatives,you like to be moving both\nmaturity and a forward timeand calendar time.That's why I just\nwrite it like that.But there's no-- so\nC sub K, little t,big T is the price\nat time of little tof a call with maturity\ncapital T and strike K.Black-Scholes and other\noption pricing formulaare all about determining\nthis-- for t less than T.Because clearly we know\nthat the price at maturityis simply the payout.I mean, that's, again,\njust the definition.So that's trivial.But we want to find out what\nthe price is at little t.So that's the whole path\nof finance-- Black-Scholesand other option\npricing methodologyis working out this.But we're actually going to\ngo down a different route.So what we're\ngoing to do-- we'regoing to construct a portfolio.So consider as a\nportfolio of what?We're going to\nconsist of two calls.OK, we're going to have lambda\ncalls with strike K.
