allthe neutron stuff and go\nover all the reactor typesthat, until this year,\nthe first time you learnedabout the non-light\nwater reactors at MITwas once you left MIT.I remember that as\nan undergrad as well.The only exposure we had\nto non-light water reactorsis in our design course, because\nwe decided to design one.So I wanted to show you guys all\nthe different types of reactorsthat are out there,\nhow they work,and start generating\nand marinatingin all the different\nvariables and nomenclaturethat we'll use to develop the\nneutron transport and neutrondiffusion equations.The nice part is\nnow, until quiz two,you can pretty much forget\nabout the concept of charge.So 8.02 can go\nback on the shelf,because every interaction\nwe do here is neutral,charge neutral.There'll be radioactive\ndecays that are not the case.But everything\nneutron is neutral.It doesn't mean it's\ngoing to be simple.It's just going to be different.But in the meantime,\ntoday is notgoing to be\nparticularly intense,but I do want to show\nyou where we're going.And this goes with\nthe pedagogical switchthat we made in this\ndepartment starting this year.And you guys are the\nfirst trial of this.We're switching to context\nfirst and theory second.I personally find it\nmuch more interestingto study the theory of\nsomething for which Iknow the application exists.Who here would agree?Just about actually everybody.OK.Yeah.That's what I thought too.So in the end, we had arguments\namongst the faculty about,well, you have to\nlearn the theoryto understand the application.And that works really well when\nyou say it behind the closedoffice door by yourself.But the fact is, I'm in it for--", "start": 0.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "yeah.I'm in it for maximum\nsubject matter retention,so in whatever order\nthat works the best.And sounds like, for you\nguys, this works the best.That's what we're doing with the\nwhole undergrad curriculum, notjust this class.So let's launch into all the\ndifferent methods of makingnuclear power, both\nfission and fusion,and to switch gears since\nwe're dealing with neutrons.I don't know what happened\nwith the-- oh, there we go.The idea here is that\nneutrons hit thingslike uranium and\nplutonium, the fissileisotopes that you\nguys saw on the exam,and caused the release\nof other neutrons.And as we come up\nwith these variables,I'm going to start\nlaying them out here.It might take more than\na board to fill them all.And I'll warn you\nahead of time, thisis the only time in\nthis course that we'regoing to have V and nu,\nthe Greek letter nu,on the board at the same time.And I'm going to make it\nreally obvious which one is nuand which one is V.So this parameter that describes\nhow many neutrons come outfrom each fission reaction\nwe refer to as nu,or the average number you'll see\nin the data tables as nu bar.And so as we come up with\nthese sorts of things,I will start going over them.And the idea here is that each\nuranium-235, or plutonium,or whatever nucleus begets\ntwo to three neutrons,the exact number for which\nis still under a hot debate,and I don't think\nit actually matters,will make a couple of fission\nproducts that take awaymost of the heat of\nthe nuclear reaction.And I just want to stop there,\neven though you know there'sgoing to be a chain reaction.And that's what makes\nnuclear power happen.And we can go over the timeline\nof what actually happensin fission and what kind of a\nnuclear reaction it really is.So in this case,\nthis is a reactionwhere a neutron is\nheading towards,this time we're actually\ngoing to give ita label, a uranium-235 nucleus.And it very temporarily,\nlike I showed you yesterday,forms a compound\nnucleus, some sort", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.337}, {"text": "of large excited nucleus\nthat lasts for about 10to the minus 14 seconds.So it doesn't\ninstantly fizz apart.There's actually a\nneutron absorption event,some sort of nuclear\ninstability, at which pointyour two fission\nproducts break off.Notice, you don't have-- let's\ncall them fission product oneand fission product two.Notice, you don't quite\nhave any neutrons yet.Neutron production is not\ninstantaneous for the followingreason.If you remember back to nuclear\nstability, when we plotted,let's say, I think that\nwas maybe Z and this was N.And I think this was\na homework problem.And you had to come up\nwith some sort of curveof best fit for the most\nstable combination of NZfor a nucleus.It was not a straight line.It was something on the\norder of like N equals--what is it?--1.0055Z plus some constant,\nsomething with a rather smallslope.Well, if you have a heavy\nnucleus, like uranium-235,and you split it apart\nevenly, let's justpretend it splits\nevenly for now,you're kind of\nsplitting that nucleusalong a rather unstable line.And, as you saw in the\nsemi-empirical mass formula,a little bit of instability\ngoes a really long waytowards making the nucleus\nextremely unstable.So let's say you'd make a\ncouple of fission productsthat just cleaved that nucleus\nwith the same proportionof protons and neutrons.How would they decay?Or how can they decay?There's a couple different ways.What do you guys think?AUDIENCE: It can emit neutrons.MICHAEL SHORT: It\ncan emit neutronsif it's really\nunstable, at which pointit would just go down\na neutron number.Or how else could it decay?", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.279}, {"text": "AUDIENCE: Alpha decay.MICHAEL SHORT: Alpha decay.Let's see, yeah, a\nlot of those will--the heavier ones tend\nto do alpha decay.What would it do at alpha decay?For alpha, I guess it will be\ngoing that direction, right?You know what?I'm not going to\nrule that out yet.So let's go with that.How else could they decay?AUDIENCE: Through beta decay.MICHAEL SHORT:\nThrough beta decay,let's say in that direction.Pretty much all\nthese happen, justnot necessarily in this order.When you have a really,\nreally asymmetric nucleus,a lot of these\nfission products willemit neutrons almost\ninstantaneouslyin the realm of like 10\nto the minus 17 seconds,some incredibly short timeline.You will start to decay\ndownwards a little bit.But you're not quite\nat the stabilityline, which is why a lot of the\nfission products then go on.And they deposit\ntheir kinetic energyby bouncing around the\ndifferent atoms in materialcreating heat.But a lot of them will also\nsend off betas or gammas.And it may take 10 to the\nminus 13 seconds for themto whatever the half-life of\nthat particular isotope is.And after around, let's say,\n10 to the minus 10 to 10to the minus 6\nseconds, dependingon the isotope in the medium,\nthose two fission productswill stop.And let's just say\nthat they stop there.So the whole process of\nfission, it's actuallyquite a compound process.First, the neutron is absorbed,\nforming a compound nucleus.Then it splits apart.Then those individual\nfission productsundergo whatever\ndecays suit them best.And that's the source of\nthe neutrons in fission.Sometimes one of\nthose fission productsmight be particularly unstable.And it might send\noff two neutrons.", "start":

this happens straightfrom the first month of 22.01.And I wanted to pull up\nsome of the nuclear dataso you can see what these values\ntend to look like and alsowhere to find them.I'm going to do that\nscreen cloning thing again.There we go.So I've already pre-pulled\nup the JANIS library.I've already clicked\non uranium-235.Thanks to you guys, I have\nall the data now on my shirtso you can see a little better.I also have it on the screen.So let's look at\nthis value righthere, nu bar total,\nneutron production.And I'll make it bigger\nso it's easier to see.Did I click on the right one?Yeah.So take a look at that.The total number of neutrons\nproduced during U-235,for most energies it's\nhovering around the 2.4 or so.There's been arguments about\nwhether it's 2.43 or 2.44.And that's a linear scale.That's not very helpful.Let's go to a logarithmic scale.That's more like what\nI'm used to seeing.Most of the fission happens for\nU-235 in the thermal region,in the region where the neutrons\nare at values, let's say,the cutoff is usually about\none electron volt or lowerin average energy.And nu bar is fantastically\nconstant at that level.Then as you go up\nand up in energy,you start to make more\nand more neutrons.Why do you guys think\nthat would be the case?What are you doing to\nthat compound nucleusas you increase the\nincoming neutron energy?AUDIENCE: It's going\nto have more energy.MICHAEL SHORT: It's going\nto have more energy itself.You might excite\nother nuclear statesthat can then lead to\nother sorts of decaysor other neutron emission.So to me, that's the reason\nwhy, once you hit about 1 MeV,", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.12}, {"text": "you can start to see a lot\nmore neutrons being given off.The reason we usually\ntreat this as a constant,notice I haven't given\nit an energy dependence,is because most of the\nfission that happensis at thermal energies.For that, I want to show you\nthe fission cross section.There are a lot\nof cross sections.And it's probably going to\nbe on a different graph,because it's in different units.And this gives you\na rough measureper atom, what's the\nprobability of fissionhappening as a function of\nincoming neutron energy?At those high energies, you have\nrelatively low cross sections,or low probabilities,\nof fission happening.Then there's this crazy\nresonance region thatlooks like a sideways mustache.But then as you get down\nto the lower energy levels,it gets much more, in\nfact, exponentially more,likely that fission will happen.So almost all the fissioning\nin a light water reactor,or any sort of other\nthermal reactor,happens at thermal energies.And that's why we take\nnu bar as a constant.You don't have to,\nespecially if you'reanalyzing what's\ncalled a fast reactoror a reactor whose neutron\npopulation remains faston purpose.And so with that,\nI want to launchinto some of the different types\nof reactors that you might see.And you guys already\ndid those calculationsin problem set one, so I don't\nhave to repeat them for you.Let's get right\ninto the acronyms.So if you haven't\nfigured this out already,nuclear is a pretty\nacronym dense field.Can anyone say they know all\nthe acronyms on this slide?You're going to know about 90%\nof them in about 90 minutes.So it's OK.Or you'll have\nseen them at least.Any look completely unfamiliar?AUDIENCE: Most of them.MICHAEL SHORT: Most of them?[LAUGHTER]Well, let's knock them off.So [INAUDIBLE],, last\nThursday, alreadyshowed you the basic layout\nof a boiling water reactor,one of the types of\nlight water reactors.And the reason that this\nis a thermal reactoris because it's full of water.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.122}, {"text": "Water, as we saw in our\nold q equation argument,is very good at\nstopping neutrons,because, if you\nguys remember this,the maximum change in energy\nthat a neutron can getis related to alpha times\nits incoming energy.Or this alpha is just A minus\n1 over A plus 1 squared.And I think this would actually\nbe a 1 minus right there.A is that mass\nnumber of whateverthe neutrons are hitting.And that one comes directly\nfrom the neutron mass number.If you remember, this was\nthe simplest reductionof the q equation,\nthe generalized qequation for kinematics\nthat we looked at.When I said let's\ndo the general form,then OK, let's take\nthe simplest form,neutron elastic scattering.Here's where it comes back.If a neutron hits water, which\nis made mostly of hydrogen,and A is 1, then it can transfer\na maximum of all of its energy,let's say, to that\nhydrogen atom, therefore,giving the neutron no energy and\nthermalizing it or slowing itdown very quickly.To show you what one of these\nthings actually looks like,that's the underside of a BWR.Did [INAUDIBLE] show\nyou this before?OK.So you've already seen what\nthis generally looks like.What about the turbine?Has anyone actually seen a\nturbine this size close up,a gigawatt electric turbine?I'm trying to see which one\nof those pixels is a person.I don't see anything\nperson-sized.There's a ladder that looks\nto be about 6 feet tall,so to give you guys a sense of\nscale of the sort of turbinesthat we say, oh, yeah, we\ndraw a turbine on our diagram.Well, it's not\nactually that simple .These things take\nup entire hallways,or kind of airport\nhangar sized buildings.I've never seen one in the US,\nbut I've seen one in Japan.It was a lot cleaner than this.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.23}, {"text": "But, otherwise, it looked\npretty much the same.And the way this\nactually works, for thosewho haven't taken any\nthermo classes yet,is this turbine is full of\ndifferent sets of blades thatare curved at an angle so\nthat when steam shoots in,it transfers some of its energy\nto get the turbine rotating.And there's going to\nbe a generator, kindof like an alternator, to\ngenerate the electricity there,which looks to be\nroughly 100 feet away.Just to give you a sense\nof scale for this stuff.As [INAUDIBLE] showed you,\na pressurized water reactoris another kind of light\nwater reactor with what'scalled an indirect cycle.So this water stays pressurized.It also stays liquid, which\nis good for neutron moderationor slowing down.Because in addition to the\nprobability of any interaction,some probability sigma, if you\nwant to get the total reactionprobability, you have to\nmultiply by its number densityto get a macroscopic\ncross section.This is why I introduce\nthis stuff wayat the beginning\nof class, so you'dhave time to marinate in it and\nthen bring it back and rememberwhat it was all about.And so every single\nreaction thatgoes on in a nuclear reactor\nhas got its own cross section.We'll probably need half\nthe board for this one.You can say you have a total\nmicroscopic cross section.These are all going to be as\na function of neutron energy.What's the probability of\nanything happening at all?And these are actually tabulated\nup on the JANIS website.So let's unclick that, get\nrid of neutron production,and go all the way to\nthe top, n comma total.So all this stuff is written\nin nuclear reaction parlance,where if you have, let's\nsay, n comma total, thatmeans a neutron comes in, and\nthat's the reaction that you'relooking at.So this data file here,\nonce I open it up,", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.547}, {"text": "will give you the probability\nthat anything at allwill happen.You can see as the neutron\nenergy gets higher,the probability of\nanything happening at allgets less, and less, and less.And it follows the shape of most\nof the other cross sections.And I'm going to leave\nthis up right there.You've also got a few\ndifferent kinds of reactions.You can have a scatter.Let's call that scatter,\nwhich we've already saidcan either be\nelastic or inelastic.It may not matter\nto us from the pointof view of neutron physics\nwhether the collisionis elastic or inelastic.All that matters is\nthe neutron goes in,and a slower neutron comes out.Because what we're really\nconcerned with hereis tracking the full\npopulation of neutronsat any point in the reactor.So we'll give this\na position vectorr, which has just\ngot x, y, and z in itor whatever other coordinate\nsystem you might happen to use.I prefer Cartesian,\nbecause it makes sense.At every energy going\nin any direction,so we now have a\nsolid angled vectorthat's got both theta and\nphi in it any given time.And the whole goal of what\nwe're going to be doing todayand all of next\nweek is to find out,how do you solve\nfor and simplifythis population of neutrons?Make sure to fill\nthat in as velocity.Let's see.Let me get back to the\ncross sections and stuff.If we want to know\nhow many neutronsare in a certain little volume\nelement, in some d volume,", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "in some certain little\nincrement of energy, dE,traveling in some very\nsmall, solid angle,d omega,

Benand Kord's group does, the\nComputational Reactor PhysicsGroup, is solve for this or\na simplified version of it,over, and over, and over\nagain for different sortsof geometries.And in order to do so, you need\nto know the rates of reactionsof every kind of\npossible reactionthat could take a neutron\nout of its current position,like if it happens to be\nmoving, which most of themare, out of its\ncurrent energy group.Which pretty much any reaction\nwill cause the neutronto lose energy.What's the only\nreaction we've talkedabout where the neutron\nloses absolutely no energy?It's a type of scattering.AUDIENCE: Forward scattering?MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,\nexactly, forward scattering.So for forward\nscattering for that casewhere theta scattering equals 0.Again, you missed.The neutron didn't actually\nchange direction at all.And, therefore, it didn't\ntransfer any energy.But for everything else, for\nevery other possible reaction,there's going to be an energy\nchange associated with itand probably some\ncorresponding change in angle,because a neutron can't\njust be moving, and hitsomething, and continue\nmoving more slowly.There's got to be some change\nin momentum to balance alongwith that change of energy.And it might slightly move\nin some different direction.And all this is happening\nas a function of time.As you can see, this gets\npretty hairy pretty quick.That's why we put the\nfull equation for thison our department t-shirts.But no one ever\nsolves the full thing.What we're going to\nbe going over is,how do you simplify\nit into somethingyou can solve with a pen\nand paper or possiblya gigantic computer?", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "But it's not impossible.So inside this sigma\ntotal, we talkedabout different scattering.And then you could\nhave absorption inall its different forms.What sort of reactions\nwith a neutronwould cause it to be absorbed?AUDIENCE: Fission.MICHAEL SHORT: Yes, fission.Thank you.So there's going to be some\nsigma fission cross sectionas a function of energy.And if it doesn't fizz,\nbut it is absorbed,we'll call that capture.But capture can mean a whole\nbunch of different thingstoo, right?There could be\nalso a whole bunchof other nuclear reactions.There could be a reaction\nwhere one neutron comes in,two neutrons go out, like\nwe looked at with berylliumin the Chadwick paper\nfrom the first dayor like

data.And 2n means two\nneutrons come out.Let's plot that cross section.You can see that the value is\n0 until you hit about 4 or 5.Oh, it's actually 5.297781 MeV.So that's the q value at\nwhich this particular reactionhappens to turn on.Might be responsible for\na little bit of the blip", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "in the total cross section.So technically, if we were\nto turn on every single crosssection in this database, it\nshould add up to that red lineright there.So you can start to get an\nidea for how much of allthe reactions of uranium-235\nare due to fission.That's the one we\nwant to exploit.So let's find fission,\nright down there.Oh, wow, there's a 3n reaction.I want to see that.That doesn't happen\nuntil 12 MeV.Yeah.So neutrons don't\ntypically tend to hit12 MeV in a fission reactor.So this is a perfect\nflimsy pretextto bring in another variable.It's called the chi spectrum or\nwhat's called the fission birthspectrum.Yeah.We've already talked about\nthe neutrons being bornand how many there were.But we didn't say at\nwhat energy they're born.In fusion reactors,\nthis is pretty simple.You've already\nlooked at this case.What is it?14.7 MeV.That's a lot simpler.That's the fusion.For fission, it's not so simple.For the case of fission, if\nyou draw energy versus this chispectrum, it takes an\ninteresting looking curvefrom about 1 MeV to about 10\nMeV with the most likely energybeing around 2 MeV.So you aren't really\ngoing to get neutronsat the energy required for a 3n\nreaction in a regular fissionreactor, just not\ngoing to happen.But it's good that you\nknow that that exists.So let's go and answer\nmy original question.How much of the total cross\nsection is due to fission?", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "Most of it,

let's say, a keV or so,almost all of the reactions\nhappening with neutronsin uranium-235 are fission.This is part of what makes\nit such a particularly goodisotope to use in reactors.The other one is, you can\nfind it in the ground,unlike most of the other\nfissile isotopes, unlike,I think, any of the\nother fissile isotopes.Thorium you got to breed and\nturn it into uranium-233.I'll have to think\nabout that one.But then you start\nto look at, whatare the other components\nof this cross section,like zn prime, inelastic\nscattering, whichdoesn't turn on until\nabout 0.002 MeV,but later on is one of\nthe major contributorsand actually is\nresponsible for--wait, I've brought\nthis for a reason.--is responsible for that\nlittle bump in the total crosssection.So eventually all\nthese things do matter.But let's think about which\nones we actually care aboutat all, because what we\neventually want to dois develop some sort of\nneutron balance equation.If we can measure the change\nin the number of neutronsas a function of position,\nenergy, angle, and time,as a function of time,\nand that would probablybe a partial derivative, because\nthere are like seven variableshere.Before I write any\nequations, it'sjust going to be a measure of\nthe gains minus the losses.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "And while every particular\nreaction has its own

perfect\nposition, energy, and angle.So that's where we're going.We'll probably start down\nthat route on Tuesday,because I promised you\nguys context today.You've all been to the\nMIT Research

decomposition\nreaction, where CO2 naturallyis in equilibrium\nwith CO and O2.And O2 plus graphite\nyields CO2 gas.Graphite was solid.In talking with a couple folks\nfrom the National

I wouldn't have been\ntold that if there was a leak.So I'd say the\nfeasibility is high,because they've been running\nfor almost half a century.The power density is very low.Why do you guys

if pressurized, is not\nas good a heat transfer mediumas water.Water is dense.It's also got one of the highest\nheat capacities of anythingwe've ever seen.The other reason is right here.If you want

to create.So by causing damage\nto the graphite,you store energy in it, which\nis known as Wigner energy.And you can store so\nmuch that it just catchesfire and explodes sometimes.That's what happened\nhere at Windscale.11 tons of uranium\nended up burning,because all of a sudden, the\ntemperature in the graphitejust started going up\nfor no reason, no reasonthat they understood\nat the time.It turns out that they had\nbuilt up enough radiation damageenergy that it started\nreleasing more heat.And releasing more heat\ncaused more of that energyto be released, and it\nwas self-perpetuatinguntil it just caught fire and\nburned 11 tons of uranium outin the countryside.This was 1957.So again, a 7 on the scale with\nno units of nuclear disasters.Argue it's probably not\nas bad as Chernobyl,so they might want a little bit\nof resolution in that scale.There's another type of gas cool\nreactor called the Pebble BedModular Reactor, a much more\nup and coming one, whereeach fuel element-- you\ndon't have fuel rods.You've actually\ngot little pebblesfull of tiny kernels of fuel.So you've got a built-in\ngraphite moderatortennis ball sized thing with\nlots of little grains of sandof UO2 cooled by\na bed of flowinghelium or something like that.And then that helium,\nor the other gas,transfers heat to water,\nwhich goes in to make steamand goes into the turbine\nlike I showed you before.So this is what the fuel\nactually looks like.Inside each one of\nthese tennis ballspheres of mostly\ngraphite, there's", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "these little kernels\nof uranium dioxideabout a half a\nmillimeter across coveredin layers of silicon\ncarbide, a really strongand dense material that keeps\nthe fission products in,because the biggest\ndanger from nuclear fuelis the highly radioactive\nfission products thatdue to their instability\nare giving offall sorts of awful, for\nanywhere from millisecondsto mega years, after\nreactor operation.And so if you keep those\nout of the coolant,then the coolant stays\nrelatively nonradioactive.And it's safe to do things\nlike maintain the plant.Then there's the very\nhigh temperature reactor,the ultimate in\nacronym creativity.It operates at a very\nhigh temperature,which has been\nsteadily decreasingover time, as reality has\ncaught up to expectations.When I first got into this\nfield, they were saying,we're going to run\nthis at 1100 Celsius.Then I started studying\nmaterial science.And I was like, yeah, nothing\nwants to be 1100 Celsius.By that time, they\ndowngraded it to 1000.Now they've asymptoted\nit at around 800 or 850due to some actual problems\nin operating things in helium.It's not the helium itself, but\nthe impurities in the heliumthat could really mess you up.And the sorts of\nalloys that theyneed to get this working,\nthese nickel superalloys,like Alloy 230,\nthey can slightlycarburize or\ndecarburize dependingon the amount of carbon\nin the helium coolant.Either way you go, you lose\nthe strength that you need.So I'll say feasibility\nis low to medium,because, well, we haven't\nreally seen one of these yet.Then onto water cooled reactors.Has anyone here\nheard of the reactorsthey have in Canada,\nthe CANDU reactors?That's my favorite acronym.I hope that was intentional.It what?AUDIENCE: It's convenient.MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.[LAUGHS] It's not like the--well, they're not sorry\nabout anything, but whatever.At any rate, one of the\nnice features about thisis you can actually use natural\nuranium, because the moderator", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "is heavy water.You have to look into what the\nsort of cross sections are.Even though deuterium\nwon't slow down neutronsas much as hydrogen will--\nwhere did my alpha thing-- oh,it was right here all along.Even though A is 2 instead\nof 1 for deuterium,it's absorption cross section,\nor specifically-- yeah,because it doesn't fission.Its absorption cross section is\nway lower than that of water.It actually functions\nas a better moderator,because fewer of those\ncollisions are absorption.And because you have a better\nneutron population and lessabsorption, you don't need\nto enrich your uranium.You also don't need to\npressurize your moderator.So you can flow some other\ncoolant through these pressuretubes and just have a big tank\nof close to something roomtemperature unpressurized\nD2O as your moderator.The problem with that\nis D2O is expensive.Anyone priced out\ndeuterium oxide before?Probably have at the\nreactor, because Iknow you have drums of it.AUDIENCE: It's like a couple\nthousand per kilogram.MICHAEL SHORT: A\ncouple thousand a kilo,it's an expensive\nbottle of water.It'll also mess you up if you\ndrink it, because a lot of it,even if it's crystal\nclear, filteredD2O, a lot of what the\ncellular machinery dependson the diffusion coefficients\nof various things in water,those solutes in water.And if you change the\nmass of the water,then the diffusion coefficients\nof the water itself,as well as the things\nin it, will change.And if you depend on, let's\nsay, exact sodium and potassiumconcentrations for your\nnerves to function,a little change in\nthat can go a long waytowards giving you a bad day.And actually, we have\na little piece of oneof these pressure tubes upstairs\nif anyone wants to take a look.There's all these\nsealed fuel bundlesinside what they call\na calandria tube,just a pressurized\ntube that's horizontal.The problem with\nsome of these isif these spacers get\nknocked out of place, whichthey do all the\ntime, those tubes", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "can start to creep\ndownward and geta little harder to cool or touch\nthe sides and change thermal.And now I'm getting\ninto material science.It's a mess.Then there's the old RBMK, the\nreactor that caused Chernobyl.You can also use natural uranium\nor low enriched uranium here.The problem though that\nled to Chernobyl-- oneof the many problems that\nled to Chernobyl was,you've got all this\nmoderator right here.So if you lose your coolant,\nlet's say you had a light waterreactor and your coolant goes\naway, your moderator alsogoes away, which means your\nneutrons don't slow downanymore.That one reaction is messing up.There we go.Which means your neutrons\ndon't slow down anymore,which means the probability\nof fission happeningcould be like\n10,000 times lower.So losing coolant in\na light water reactor,temperature might go\nup, but it's not goingto give you a nuclear bad day.In the RBMK reactor,\nit will and it did.And in addition,\nthe control rods,which were supposed to shut down\nthe reaction, made of thingslike boron 4 carbide,\nor hafnium, or somethingwith a really high\ncapture cross sectionwere tipped with graphite\nto help them ease in.So you've got\nmoderator tipped rods,which induce additional\nmoderation, whichhelps slow down the\nneutrons even more to wherethey fission even better.And that's what led to what's\ncalled a positive feedbackcoefficient.So the more you tried to\ninsert the control rodsand the more you\ntried to fix things,the worse things got\nin the nuclear sense.And in something like\na quarter of a second,the reactor power went\nup by like 35,000 times.And we'll do a millisecond by\nmillisecond rundown of whathappened in Chernobyl after\nwe do all this neutronphysics stuff when\nyou'll be better equippedto understand it.But suffice to say, there were\nsome positive coefficients herethat are to be avoided at all\ncosts in all nuclear reactordesign.In the actual reactor\nhall you can go and stand", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "on one of these things.It's a very different design\nfrom what you're used to.I don't think anyone\nwould let you standon top of a pressure vessel.First, your shoes would\nmelt, because they're usuallyat like 300 Celsius or so.And second of all, you'd\nprobably get a little too muchradiation.But this is actually\nwhat an RBMK reactorhall looks like for one of\nthe units that didn't blow up.There were multiple\nunits at that site.Then there's the\nsupercritical water reactor.Let's say you want to run\nat higher temperaturesthan regular water\nwill allow you to.You can pressurize\nit so much that watergoes beyond the supercritical\npoint in the phase senseand starts to behave not\nlike liquid, not like a gas,but somewhere in between,\nsomething that's really, reallydense, so getting towards\nthe density of water, notquite, which means it's\nstill a great moderator,but still can cool the\nmaterials quite wellto extract heat to make\npower and so on and so on.Yeah.AUDIENCE: So supercritical\nrefers to the coolantnot the neutrons?MICHAEL SHORT: Good question.For a supercritical\nwater reactor,it most definitely\nrefers to the coolant.It's the phase of\nthe coolant whereit's beyond the liquid\ngas separation line,and it's just\nsomething in between.Any of these reactors\ncan go supercritical,where you're producing more\nneutrons than you're consuming.And that is a nuclear bad day.But the supercritical\nwater reactordoes not refer to neutron\npopulation, just a coolant.Good question.It's never come up before.But it's like, should\nhave thought of that.And so then my favorite,\nliquid metal reactors,like LBE, or\nLead-Bismuth Eutectic.It's a low melting point\nalloy of lead and bismuth.Lead melts at around 330\nCelsius, bismuth 200 something.Put them together, and it's\nlike a low temperature solder.It melts at 123.5 Celsius.You can melt it in a frying pan.This is nice, because you\ndon't want your coolantto freeze when you're\ntrying to cool your reactor,", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "because imagine something\nhappens, you lose power.The coolant freezes\nsomewhere outside the core.You can't get the\ncore cool again.That's called a loss\nof flow accidentthat can lead to\na really bad day.And the lower your melting\npoint is the better.Sodium potassium is already\nmolten to begin with.Sodium melts at like 90 Celsius.And when you add two\ndifferent metals together,you almost always\nlower the melting pointof the combination.In this case,\nforming what's calledthe eutectic, or a lowest\npossible melting point alloy.The sodium fast reactor\nhas a number of advantages,like you don't really\nneed any pressure.As long as you have a cover\ngas keeping the sodiumfrom reacting with anything,\nlike the moisture in the air,or any errant water\nin the room, youcan just circulate\nit through the core.And liquid metals are\nawesome heat conductors.They might not have\nthe best heat capacity,as in how much energy per gram\nthey can store like water.But they're really\ngood conductorswith very high\nthermal conductivity.They also are really good at\nnot slowing down neutrons.So these tend to be what's\ncalled fast reactors thatrely on the ability of\nother isotopes of uranium,like uranium-238, to undergo\nwhat's called fast fission.And I want to show you\nwhat that looks like.Let's pull up U-238 and look\nat its fission cross section.And you might find\nthat it shouldlook a fair bit different.So we'll go down to number\n18 to fission cross section,very, very different.So U-238 is pretty terrible\nat fission at low energies.It's pretty good at\ncapturing neutrons.This is where we\nget plutonium-239,like you guys saw on the exam.But then you go to really high\nenergies and all of a sudden,it gets pretty good at\nundergoing fission on its own.And so the basis behind\na lot of fast reactors", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "is a combination of making\ntheir own fuel and the factthat uranium-238 fast\nfissions even better than itthermal fissions.So something good\nfor you to know,even though it's\nnot a fissile fuel,that's light water\nreactor people talking.You can get it to fission if\nthe neutron populations higher.Now, there's some\nproblems with this.It takes some time for neutrons\nto slow down from 1 to 10 MeVto about 0.025 eV.If your neutrons don't need to\nslow down and travel anywhere,and pretty much all they have\nto do is be born and absorbedby a nearby uranium\natom, the feedback timeis faster in these\nsorts of reactors.They're inherently more\ndifficult to control.And you can't use normal\nphysics like thermal expansionof things that might happen\non the order of microto nanoseconds if it takes less\ntime than that for one neutronto be born and find\nanother uranium atom.You can still use it somewhat,\nbut not quite as much.So it's something to note\nbacked up by nuclear data.And that's what one of\nthem actually looks like.These things have\nbeen built. That'sa blob of liquid sodium on\nthe Monju reactor in Japan.And where I was all\nlast week in Russia,they actually have\nfleets of fast reactors.Their BN-300 and BN-600 reactors\nare 300 and 600 megawatt sodiumcooled reactors.One of them in the\nChelyabinsk regionthey use pretty much\nfor desalinationdown in the center\nof Russia, wherethere's no oceans nearby\nand probably dirty water.They actually use that\nto make clean water.They also use this\nfor power productionand for radiation\ndamage studies.So when it comes to\nradiation material science,these fast reactors are\nreally where it's at.Yeah, you just\nnoticed the bottom.I went to Belgium, to their\nnational nuclear labs,where they have a\nslowing sodium test loop.It's not a reactor, but it's\nlike a thermal hydraulicsand materials test loop.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "And I asked a simple question.Where's the bathroom?And they started laughing at me.And they said, we're not putting\nany plumbing in a sodium loopbuilding.You'll have to go to\nthe next building over.And that's when I noticed, there\nweren't any sprinkler systemsor toilets.But every 15 or 20 feet, there\nwas a giant barrel of sand.That's the fire extinguisher\nfor a liquid metal fireis you just cover it with\nsand, absorb the heat,keep the air out, the moisture\nout, wick away the moistureor whatever else sand does.I don't know.But you can't use normal\nfire extinguishersto put out a sodium fire.AUDIENCE: When you said sand,\nI thought of kitty litter.MICHAEL SHORT: Ah.I don't know if that would work.[LAUGHTER]I guess it's worth a shot.[LAUGHTER]With glasses, and safety,\nand stuff, of course.And the ones that I spent\nthe most time working on,like I showed you in\nthe paper yesterday,is the lead or\nlead-bismuth fast reactor.This one does not\nhave the disadvantagesof exploding like sodium.It does have the disadvantage,\nlike I showed you yesterday,of corroding everything,\npretty much everything.And so the one thing keeping\nthis thing back was corrosion.And I say the\nultimate temperatureis medium, but higher soon.Hopefully, someone\npicks up our workand is like, yeah, that was\na good idea, because we thinkit can raise the\noutlet temperatureof a lead-bismuth reactor\nby like 100 Celsiusas long as some other unforeseen\nproblem doesn't pop up,and we don't quite know yet.These things also\nalready exist in the formof the Alfa Class attack\nsubmarines from the SovietUnion.These are the only subs\nthat can outrun a torpedo.So you know that old algebra\nproblem, if person A leavesPittsburgh at 40 miles\nan hour and personB leaves Boston at\n30 miles an hour,where do the trains collide or\nI forget how it actually ends?Well, in the end, if a\ntorpedo leaves an American subat whatever speed and the Alfa\nClass submarine notices it,how close do they have to be\nbefore the torpedo runs outof gas?So what I was told by the\ndesigner of these subs,", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "a fellow by the name of Georgy\nToshinsky, when he came hereto talk about his experience\nwith these lead-bismuthreactors is, there is a\nbutton on the sub that'sthe Forget About Safety,\nIt's a Torpedo button.Because if you're underwater\nin a lead-bismuth reactorand a torpedo is\nheading at you, youhave a choice between maybe\ndying in a nuclear catastropheand definitely dying\nin a torpedo explosion.Well, that button is the\nI Like Those Odds button.And you just give full\npower to the enginesand whatever else\nhappens, happens.The point is, you may be\nable to outrun the torpedo.And quite popular nowadays,\nespecially in this department,is molten salt cooled reactors\nthat actually use liquid salt,not dissolved, but molten\nsalt itself as the coolant.It doesn't have as many of\nthe corrosion problems as leador the exploding\nproblems as sodium.It does have a high melting\npoint problem though.They tend to melt at\naround 450 degrees Celsius.But there's one\npretty cool feature.You can dissolve\nuranium in them.So remember how in\nlight water reactorsthe coolant is\nalso the moderator?In molten salt\nreactors, the coolantis also the fuel, because\nyou can have principallyuranium and lithium\nfluoride saltco-dissolved in each other.And the way you make\na reactor is youjust flow a bunch of that\nsalt into nearby pipes.And then you get less, what's\ncalled, neutron leakage,where in each of these pipes\nonce in a while uraniumwill give off a few neutrons.Most of them will just come out\nthe other ends of the pipes,and you won't have a reaction.When you put a whole bunch\nof molten salt together,most of those neutrons\nfind other moltensalt.
