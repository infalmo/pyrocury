to dive back\nin to blockchain, money.And we didn't lose\ntoo many peoplewhen we did cryptographic\nhash functionsand digital\nsignatures last week.So I thank you for\nall being back.So what were today's\nstudy questions again?What's the Byzantine\nGenerals problem?Anybody want to tell me what the\nByzantine Generals problem is?Ben.AUDIENCE: So, the\nByzantine General problemis this sort of general\nmathematical puzzle.And basically, what it is is,\nhow do you coordinate actorswhen they may be an actor\nwho's not acting in the bestinterests of the group--how do you sort of get a\ngood actor on that then?GARY GENSLER: So there--it might be how to coordinate\nwhen somebody is notacting in good faith\nas a malicious actor.But it also might be\njust somebody thatdoesn't get the communication.Somebody that-- there's a\nthought, whether it's maliciousor not.How we doing, Alene?Yeah.How does proof of work and\nmining in Bitcoin address it?We're going to\nwalk through this,and I'm going to give\nyou my sense of it.But does anybody want to\ngive a short version--", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.151}, {"text": "prepared for a--Brodush.AUDIENCE: So the\nproposed way solves itin a probabilistic way, rather\nthan a deterministic way,using amount of\nCPU power to solvea problem of certain complexity\nto prove that one consensus hasbeen reached by a majority\nof the participants.GARY GENSLER: All right.So what Brodush said is\nit's probabilistic insteadof deterministic.That you use CPU power\nto form some consensus.I think that's what you said.I'm going to walk through\nthis in more detail.But does anybody want to\ngive another shot at it?AUDIENCE: I could say so\nwhen a transaction happens,it is posted.And then miners get\nin, and that theytry to compete in solving this.And whoever gets it first,\nthen he claims the award.I would also say it requires\na lot of CPU processing power.I'm quoting the [INAUDIBLE].So it needs to be powered.Big computers.So there is a question\naround [INAUDIBLE]..GARY GENSLER: So remind\nme your first name?AUDIENCE: Riham.GARY GENSLER: Riham.AUDIENCE: Yes.GARY GENSLER: Riham says\nit's about people calledminers or computers\ncalled miners,which we'll talk about today,\nusing computer power again.But transactions were\npart of that as well asto how it comes together.I'm not going to torture you\nand ask a bunch more but, Addy?", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "AUDIENCE: I think one of\nthe other important ideasis that even though solving\nthe problem is really hard,validating that the\nsolution is correct is easy.So what is ensured is that\neven though miners are thinkingabout the computing power\nto solve [INAUDIBLE],,it can propagate it [INAUDIBLE]\nand then validate it.GARY GENSLER: So a\nkey point that Addy--Addy raises is that once\nsomebody solves the puzzle,it can be propagated\nacross a network.And then others on the\nnetwork can validate it.So what we'll talk\nabout a little bit lateris that it's a hard\npuzzle to solve,but an easy puzzle to verify.And this is an important\nasymmetry in essence,that there's a lot of\nresources to solve a puzzle,but once knowing\nthe answer, there'svery limited resources to verify\nthat it's the right answer.If it was not asymmetric,\nit would not work as well.So it's a key part of the design\nof many cryptographic things,but particularly, Adam\nBack's sort of noveltyin the 1990s of proof of work.I don't know if that's\njust a relaxed bit for you,or you have your\nhands up, Derek.AUDIENCE: Ah, no.That's--GARY GENSLER: That's\njust a relaxed pose.I like it.We're going to talk about other\nconsensus protocols as well.Proof of work is not the\nonly consensus protocol,but how to address ourselves\nto Byzantine fault tolerance.And then some of the\neconomic incentives, so we'lltalk about the native currency.What's the native currency\nof the first blockchainapplication?AUDIENCE: Bitcoin.GARY GENSLER: Bitcoin.How many of you in this\nroom have owned a Bitcoinat some point in time?So you've all owned\nthe native currency", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "that helps a blockchain.You got the opportunity to\nread a paper that a group of ushere at MIT co-authored.I hope some of you actually\nwere able to download it and--good.Apparently, even when\nyou write something,it still goes behind\na copyright wall.So I'm glad to know that\nit was actually available.And then back to the National\nInstitute of Standardsand Technology paper as well--this time the next chapters.And then a paper from\nabout 25 years agoon the Byzantine\nGenerals problem itself.So what are we\ngoing to do today?We're going to go back\nthrough the design.We're going to talk about\nconsensus through proof of workBitcoin mining-- it's important.It's relevant.But it's kind of some fun\nfacts about that as well.The native currency-- of\ncourse, Bitcoin of the first.But there's now at least 1600\ndifferent native currencies.What does it mean\nto have a network?And why do networks matter\nparticularly for blockchain?Some of the other consensus\nprotocols, and then just wrapup.So just going back\nto the review,and this is what we talked\nabout a bit on Thursday.But I think it's relevant to\njust kind of bring it back.I found when I was\nfirst learning this,it's hard to keep\nall the moving parts.Remember, there's--\nthat graphic,you'll see all semester.But it's all the\ndifferent blocks.And it's append only.What does append only mean?Andrew.Why does that matter, this\nword append only that wetalked about last Thursday?AUDIENCE: Yeah.So that it's immutable.It cannot be changed.GARY GENSLER: Right.So it's immutable.Now, of course, because\ncryptography maybe can bebroken, but we use the word\nimmutable that it cannot be", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "changed, except for\nmaybe as Alene so--I like that that's in his book.You all have to see this.This is very clever.You know, a little--how to do a flag.Maybe it's immutable\nexcept for one out of 10to the 40th times it could\nbe broken or something.AUDIENCE: Can I interject\nand actually saythat it's not that\ngood, actually.So technically,\nBitcoin and all ofthese permissionless\ncryptocurrencies, one wayto attack them is to mine--to get a lot of\nmining power and mine.But another way\nto attack them isto just take control\nover the actual network,like the internet.So if you're an internet service\nprovider, or if you're China,you can actually fork Bitcoin\nwith zero mining powerby just controlling the network.So there's actually\nan assumptionbehind how this\nthing works, whichis that the network works.Because everybody\nsees the messages.GARY GENSLER: I agree with you.But there's also\nsome assumptions--let's say that China,\nor any state actor,chose to fork one of these.If it's considerably\nless than a majority--AUDIENCE: No.Zero mining.You can fork with zero mining.You won't get any mining charge,\nif you control the network.GARY GENSLER: If you control\nthe worldwide network, or justthe network--AUDIENCE: Not the\nmining network.The actual internet.GARY GENSLER: I understand.Are you talking about\nthe worldwide internet,or you're talking about\none country's internet?AUDIENCE: Let's say\nyou're in China.There's 50% of Chinese\nminers in China.I forbid these Chinese miners\nto broadcast with blocks.They find a block\nthat goes here,and they find another block\nthat goes here, it goes here,and it goes there.The rest of the world will\nfind the block that goes here.I have a fork.It goes here and here,\nand I have two forks.They don't see each other.GARY GENSLER: So\nwe're going to talkabout forks a little later.Can we hold Alene's\npoint until then?AUDIENCE: Sure.Sure.GARY GENSLER: And then I'm\ngoing to share with you whatSatoshi Nakamoto wrote about\nthis very issue back in 2010.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "AUDIENCE: And he\nwas writing backwhere you have mining power.He was assuming\nthe network works.Again, just to clarify.GARY GENSLER: Alene's raising\na point as to whether somebodycaptures part of the internet.And if the internet itself, by\ncapturing part of the internet,you fork the blockchain.And what I was just--said I would hold for later,\nbut instead I'll cover now,is this question was\nraised in an email exchangewith whomever Satoshi Nakamoto\nwas back in around 2010.And his answer to\nAlene's questionthat I'm just helping\nshare with you all,is that as long as that\npart of the internet thatwas walled off was less than\na majority, and in fact,if it was China, because that\nwas in the example even eightyears ago, it would be\nconsiderably less than 50%,that within a reasonable\namount of time,maybe it would take a few hours,\nbut within a reasonable amountof time, one chain\nwould be wherethe majority of the\nmining power was.And that it could take a\nwhile, but the other onewould probably stop,\nthat people wouldstop investing electricity\nand CPU time within China,because they would\nrealize some way.Now, that was the\ntheory at least.AUDIENCE: And just to add onto\nthat, something to realizeis like if you--I mean, like, you said\nwe'll go into forks.But just for people\nwho don't know,like if you go in one\nfork, then anythingafter that you go in all forks.So like if you lose connection\nto the main Bitcoin network,you'll still have that, as long\nas you have your private keys.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "So if somebody in China\nrealizes that they'reon the wrong chain,\nit's not like you'velost your actual bitcoin.GARY GENSLER: That's correct.They won't lose it up to,\nif I can use the term, priorto the fork.AUDIENCE: Correct.GARY GENSLER: Was a question?Brodush.AUDIENCE: So just to add to\nAlene's point, essentially.So the way he said--GARY GENSLER: Since you're in\nthe back of the room, speak up.AUDIENCE: Yeah.So to add to Alene's\npoint actually.So there's an assumption,\nunderlying assumption,for the--that the real problem in the\ncontext of blockchain is--you have the assumption that\nthe network can actuallyverify that the--what is being--[INAUDIBLE] what the network\nis actually valid information.So that is kind of an\nunderlying assumption.If the network is\ncontaminated, then the premiseon which the problem\nis being solved,or the protocol that is being\ngiven here as a solutionto the problem, is\nactually not validif the network is contaminated.So that way, it is indeed\na underlying [INAUDIBLE]..GARY GENSLER: So I think,\nbecause I didn't pick upevery word, you're\njust saying that thereis an underlying\nassumption that the networkprotocol, the communication\nprotocol of the internet,is not compromised\nor walled off.But also, that it's working.It creates a database.We've talked about it\nthrough hash functionsand digital signatures,\nand then consensus.So what were the\ntechnical features?I thought about it a little\nbit from our last classto help just thinking\nthrough in three buckets--the cryptography\nand timestampingthat we talked\nabout last Thursday;what we're going to\ntalk about today,the decentralized consensus\nprotocols and the network,of course, and the\nnative currency;and then lastly, transaction\nscript that we're going to talkabout this coming Thursday.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "Now, it's not just three buckets\nbecause it's three lectures.But it's three buckets\nbecause they have somethingto do with each other.The cryptography, which is at\nthe core of cryptocurrenciesand blockchains, and is\nthe core of a lot of thingson the internet today, the\nconsensus mechanism, and thenthe transaction script itself.Cryptography, as\nwe've talked about--communications in the presence\nof adversaries-- also,a form of ways to make\ncommitments and securecomputation.Hash functions, if you\nrecall what we talked about.What's the key of\na hash function?Here.Joaquin.AUDIENCE: The key\nof hash function?GARY GENSLER: One--\nthe elevator pitch.You just have to make sure\nthat your sibling knows you.What's that?AUDIENCE: If you have two, the\nprivate and the public key.GARY GENSLER: All right.That's a good--\nthat's cryptography,but not a hash function.AUDIENCE: OK.AUDIENCE: It's a\nfingerprint of a fixedlength of any amount of data.GARY GENSLER: I like that.One way data compression--a crossword puzzle.Anybody here do the New\nYork Times crossword puzzleon a mobile app?Good.So if you do a Wednesday's New\nYork Times crossword puzzle,does it tell you whether\nyou're correct on Wednesday?Or does it not tell\nyou you're correct?When does it-- I don't\ndo the New York Timescrossword puzzles.But--AUDIENCE: Erin.GARY GENSLER: Erin.AUDIENCE: I'm actually-- I\nusually do ones in the past.But I think it\nwill tell you maybeeither that day or the next\nday, or maybe [INAUDIBLE]..GARY GENSLER: Stephanie.AUDIENCE: So it\ntells you as soonas you finish the puzzle whether\nor not you have any errors.But it won't-- but you can't\nactually check what the errorsare unless you want to\ninvalidate your streak for that", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "day.So basically, you get a streak\nevery time you [INAUDIBLE]..GARY GENSLER: I don't\nactually know if the New YorkTimes use hash functions.But they could.They could, because\nthey could stickthe whole entire crossword\npuzzle into a hash,and it's a commitment scheme.And remember, if you change even\none thing in the input data,the hash will come\nout differently.So the New York Times\ncould use a hash function,so that Stephanie\ncould find out, right?Because you can only push\nto see if it's correctwhen you finish the whole.And it either tells you\nyou have it or not, right?So I'm just--I'm bringing it to real life\nthat a hash function-- justthink of the New York\nTimes crossword puzzle.And if you don't\nremember, ask Stephanie.We talked about\nappend-only logs.And recall that in\nblockchain, in Bitcoin, thereis a bunch of information\nin the head of the block.And that which is in\nthe head of the blockis put together like the New\nYork Times crossword puzzle.And we have a chain of blocks.Most of the data, though, is\nstored efficiently in somethingcalled a Merkle tree.Again, it uses a whole\nlot of hash functions.And so it's a way\nto be efficient,but it's also a way\nto secure the data.So now, we're going to get\nback to your favorite thing--digital signatures.So what's a digital\nsignature do?AUDIENCE: You can prove that\nyou're signing somethinglike a transaction\nwith your private key.And the other person\non the outsidecould prove that\nyou are the one that", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "signed it with your public key.GARY GENSLER: Perfect.So it guards against\ntampering and impersonation.I didn't go through\nthis last Thursday,but think of digital\nsignatures two different ways--a digital signature that\nyou use without a hash,and in Bitcoin and blockchain,\noften it's actually-- it'scombined with a hash.So as Joaquin just\nwent through, youcan have a private key that\nyou sign something with,the sender's public key, and\na signature, and exactly that.But it's also able to do it\nwhere you have a hash as well.You take all the\ndata, all the message,and you've put it into\nit with a signature.And this is a little\nbit too complex,and it was last\nThursday's lecture,but it's important to know that\nwhat blockchain is basicallydoing, most\nblockchains do, is theytake a lot of information,\na transaction for instance,hash that information.And why do we hash it again?Kelly?AUDIENCE: To protect it from\nother users of the network,sort of like we talked\nabout Alice and Bob,and how one has to be\naware of each other's key,and then back verify\nthe incoming message.GARY GENSLER: Right.And it also compresses\nsome of the data.But it's a commitment scheme.It's like this is it.This is actually the New\nYork Times crossword puzzlethat answers all the questions.So usually it first hashes\nit, meaning it's a commitment.And then put a digital\nsignature on it.And there was one last thing\nwe talked about last week.What are Bitcoin addresses?Isabella, can you tell me\nwhen a Bitcoin address is?AUDIENCE: Umm.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "Is that what-- like,\nI guess tells youwhere the Bitcoins being sent.GARY GENSLER: So it tells you\nwhere Bitcoin is being sent.Ben, you want to\nhelp out a little.AUDIENCE: So it's the\npublic hash, public key?Public hash of the--GARY GENSLER: It's close.So it's basically that--between Isabelle and\nBen, you've got it.It's basically how any\nof the native currency--Bitcoin-- can be identified.But it is a public key\nwith a couple extra hashes,and a little bit\nother fancy footworkto make it compressed\nand smaller.But it is literally what\nyou can send Bitcoins to.So it's determined by the public\nkey, but it's not identical to.And I found a fancy\nlittle chart to define it.A private key leads to a\npublic key through some form.And in Bitcoin, it's called\nelliptic curve multiplication.But there are other forms\nof public and private keys.The public key,\nthen it gets hashed.And then it goes through a code\nthat makes it shorter, whichis the Bitcoin address.Part of the reason\nit was hashed,and part of the reason it\ngoes through that extra code,is to make it even more secure.It's not the only reason.It also compresses\nit a bit more.But those of you who\nhave ever owned Bitcoin,you have a wallet.And the wallet keeps\nthose Bitcoin addresses.All right.So now let's talk about\ndecentralized networks,the topic of today.Any questions about the\nreview for last Thursday?I know it was quick.Alon?AUDIENCE: I have a question\nabout the double hash part.Does that mean that it's\nnow less feasible to be,", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "like, less immutable?Because if you take\na 24-digit hash,and you contract it to a 4-digit\nhash, there's fewer options.GARY GENSLER: I think that\nyou're-- the question is,is if the output of a\nhash function is shorter,is it possibly more breakable?I think mathematically,\nthat might be correct.However, this actually\ngoes through two hashes--one, which is this\nmechanism called SHA-256.And the other one, I'm going to\nmispronounce, but down to 160.So I think because it's going\nthrough two different hashes,the answer is it's even\nharder to break both.Does that--AUDIENCE: That makes sense.GARY GENSLER: Any other\nquestions about the review?No.Please.Derek.AUDIENCE: So you said\nhashing the public keymakes it more secure.I'm just wondering, because the\npublic key is for the public.So what is the-- where does\nthe added security come from?GARY GENSLER: So the only thing\nthat you're actually showingis a Bitcoin address.Until later-- and we'll talk\na lot about this on Thursday--when you actually\ndo a transaction,you have to then\ndisclose your public key.So initially, the storage\nis around Bitcoin addresses.And some will advise--and it's why many\nwallets do this--that you should never use\nthe same public key twice.Though, numerous people\ndo in blockchains.But to be most secure,\nyou would constantlybe creating new public\nkey/private key pairs.And once you've used it, move\non and get a new set of keys.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "Got it?AUDIENCE: Yeah.GARY GENSLER: So\ndistributed networks--we talked about Byzantine\nGenerals problem.So I found some\nByzantine generals.They want to all\nattack that castle.Or what if only three of\nthem do, and two of themsay retreat?That's the visual.That's the problem.The only way to win in\nthis mathematical gametheory, a paper that was\nwritten some 25 years ago,is if they all said attack,\nor all said retreat.But the same thing sort\nof came to computers.And the core thing about\na permissionless systemis there is no\ncentral authority.And if there's no\ncentral authority,how does a distributed\nnetwork, like the distributedset of generals, come\nto some agreement?Do we attack?Do we retreat?Well, it's based on a consensus\nprotocol and a native currency.That's the key innovation\nof Satoshi Nakamoto,is to pull it all together.But it was built on the\nbacks of other people.Adam Back, in 1997,\nhe proposed a wayto address email\nspam and other typesof computer problems called\ndenial of service attacks.Now, it ultimately wasn't used.I mean, he proposed it.It was used for a short\nwhile, and then itwasn't subsequently used.But it's important to understand\nthat the proof of workin the middle of Bitcoin\nwas created 11 or 12 yearsbefore the Bitcoin paper.And the key was\nbasically requirea bunch of computational\nwork using hash functions.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "And so the email, or the\nheader of the email-- thisis Adam Back's, not Bitcoin.But the email, or the\nheader of the email,went into the hash\nfunction, creates a hash.But the difficulty of finding\nwhether it's confirmed waswas it in a certain\nrange of hashes?And he did that by the\nquote, \"leading zeros.\"Does anybody want to guess\nwhy he did it this way?Or Alene's just going to tell\nus probably and not guess, but--who hasn't spoken yet?Emily, you want to try it out?AUDIENCE: I'm not totally sure.GARY GENSLER: Daniel?AUDIENCE: I mean, I guess just,\nlike, preserve some privacyaround the emails?GARY GENSLER: Well, so it\ndefinitely preserved privacy.But he was trying to put\nsome computational work.Every email that\nwould be sent wouldtake one to two or three\nseconds of computational work.That was in his original paper.It would take a few seconds.AUDIENCE: The fact that we--earlier we were\ntalking about the factthat we need a way\nin which we haveto make the puzzles difficult\nto solve, but easy to validate.This is exactly how the\nwhole thing is accomplished,by setting the hash into a fixed\ncharacteristic, like leading--a number of leading\nzeros, what you getis to modify a small piece\nof the whole information,and try and try until you\nget that specific hash.And that makes it really\ncomputational intensive,but validating is just\nrunning one hashing function.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "So--GARY GENSLER: Do you have a--AUDIENCE: I mean, it comes\nback to what we talked aboutlast time with the nonces.You need to try out a bunch\nof different random numbersin order to get the right\nnumber of leading zeros.And it could be--I don't know.I think it could be\nlike leading anything.But he chose zero\nbecause it's nice.But you need to try to\nget the numbers in orderto get the right number.GARY GENSLER: And in\nthe email circumstance,his thought was it will take\ntwo or three seconds for anyonesending an email to\ndo this proof of work.But it will take a nanosecond\nor less to confirm it.But if you were\nsending spam, and youhad a computer to send\nmillions of spam timestwo or three\nseconds apiece, thatwould be too much\nfor the spammer.That was it.So any one person-- any\nperson sending one email,it won't be too bad.Anyone sending millions of\nemails, it would be lousy.And so that's why this concept\nwas in the midst of emails.And it could be\nefficiently proved.So back to blockchain, the\ninnovation was basically,how do we do this with a chain?How do we do this with\na chain set of works?And remember, Stuart\nHaber, that whole thingabout the blockchain and\nwhat's in the New York Timeswas that chain of information.But here, why\ndon't we do a proofof work between the chain?And I found a little graphic.But the SHA-256, that's the\nformula which is used to hashthe header--the previous hash, the\ntransaction hash, a time stamp,and a nonce.Can you find a hash that has\na certain number of leadingzeros?This was the key innovation.In a sense, or maybe\nSatoshi Nakamoto", "start": 1680.0,

thing?AUDIENCE: The hash\nshould change completely.GARY GENSLER: The hash\nwill change completely.So what happened?What did we change?Here, I'll go back and forth.AUDIENCE: You changed the color.GARY

the little\n18-minute video that wasassigned for last Thursday, I\njust went in, and I was tryingto--I was trying to get--I was trying to get\nthe money for me.And it invalidated\nthe rest of the chain.And that's really-- that's the\nsort of innovation or geniusis, is if you try to\ngo into a former block,whether it's the last block or\na block 100,000 blocks away,and change one

on top of them, theneventually they're ignored.Some people call\nthem orphan blocks.But I'll call them stale\nblocks, because theywere actually created.But the information that's\nin them is kind of

miner--Andrew could validate\nif he wants to.So there's a lot of free\nriding that goes along,and the economics\nof free riding.And then there's wallets,\nwhich probably 30 or 40 of youhave on your computer somewhere.They store and view and\nsend all the transactions.But importantly, also\ncreate the key pairs.So a lot to cover.There's one that's not\na node itself at all.It's called the mempool,\nor the memory pool.And we're going to talk\nabout this more on Thursday.But the memory pool stores\nall the unconfirmed,but yet, already validated.So they've been\nvalidated by somebody.A transaction goes\nout into the network.A full node validates it, and\nit's put in a memory pool.And Amanda grabs\nthe memory pool,and sends it out to everybody\nin this class in a block.And then we mine it.We're not going to chat\nmuch about these right now.But we talked about--there was a Coindesk article.How many of you actually\nskimmed it, looked at it?Did it mean anything\nto you, or just meant", "start": 4200.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "that there's some alternative?What's that, Prya?AUDIENCE: Just that\nthere's some alternative.GARY GENSLER: There's\nsome alternative.That's what it meant to\nme the first time I lookedinto this about six months ago.But I want to just mention what\nthe alternatives come down to.They generally randomized\nor delegate the selection.So rather than saying\nany one of 10,000 nodescan prove that this\nworks, they usevarious mathematical means--randomized or delegated.And sometimes they\ndo a little bitof delegation and\nrandomization to pickwho's going to validate\nthe next block.It all comes down to who\nis picking the next block.Is it by Adam Back's sort of, as\nSatoshi Nakamoto put out there,we'll call it Nakamoto\nconsensus, proof of work?And you'll have a\npaper for Thursdaythat talks about Nakamoto\nConsensus, the Clark paper.But-- or is there some other\nrandomized, delegated wayto do it?In some of them, they\nhave a second check.If there's a delegated\nperson to validate something,they put a second check\nin there that there'sanother group that officiates\nand says whether it's correct.And so there's proof of stake,\nwhich is based on the stakeyou have in the\nunderlying currency.There's proof of activity, which\nis kind of a hybrid of proofof work and proof of stake.Proof of burn-- are you\nwilling to give up coins?Proof of capacity-- do\nyou have storage capacity?And you might have\na tiered system.The major permissionless\nblockchains all use proofof work.And the reason is\nnobody's really solved--", "start": 4320.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "all of these other\nalternatives, no one'sreally solved for a couple\nof problems in them.But they usually\nfind a way to bemore efficient through\ndelegation and randomization,and might have a backup\nset of checks on it.DASH and NEO will say that\nthey use proof of stake.But they're actually kind of\nusing some form of masternodesor set up professional nodes.But DASH and NEO are\nkind of, I think,the 13th and 15th largest\nmarket value cryptos, whichmeans everything else kind of--And Ripple doesn't--Ripple's really almost like a\npermission system rather thanpermissionless.I mean, they would say\nthey're permissionless.But it's a confirmed set of\nnodes in the node system.So that's it for today.We're going to do\ntransactions on Thursday.I moved that study question.And then I'm going\nto ask you to readthrough the Clark\npaper, which is reallythe academic pedigree.Where is this built on?What's the background?But I think it's a good way\nto bring it all together.And remember on\nThursday, you allcome in to answer this\nquestion-- your own viewas to who Satoshi Nakamoto is.There is no right answer.But if MIT's Blockchain and\nMoney class can answer that,I'm sure that we'll get a\nwrite-up somewhere about it.", "start": 4440.0, "heat": 0.0}]
