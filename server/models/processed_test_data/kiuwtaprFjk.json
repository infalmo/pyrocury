[{"text": "PROFESSOR: So here is\nof something funny.You might say, OK,\nwhat is simpler?A theory that is linear or\na theory that is not linear?And the answer, of course, a\nlinear theory is much simpler.General-- Maxwell's\nequations are linear.Einstein's theory of\nrelativity is very nonlinear,very complicated.How about classical mechanics?Is classical mechanics\nlinear or nonlinear?What do we think?Can't hear anyone.Linear, OK.You may think it's linear\nbecause it's supposedto be simple, but it's not.It's actually is very nonlinear.Newton could solve\nthe two body problembut he couldn't solve\nthe three body problem.Already with three bodies, you\ncannot superpose solutions thatyou get with two bodies.It's extraordinarily\ncomplicated,classical mechanics.Let me show you.If you have motion in\none dimension, in 1D,you have the equation of\nmotion, motion in one dimension,and there are potential V of\nx, that this time independent--a particle moving\nin one dimension xwith under the influence\nof a potential, V of x.The second-- the dynamical\nvariable is x of t.The dynamical variable.And the equation of motion is--so let me explain this.This is force equal\nmass times acceleration.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.601}, {"text": "This is mass, this\nis acceleration,the second derivative\nof the position,and V force is minus the\nderivative of the potentialevaluated at the position.You know, derivatives\nof potentials--if you think of a potential,\nthe derivative of the potentialis here positive, and you\nknow if you have a masshere, it tends to\ngo to the left,so the force is on the\nleft, so it's minus.So V prime is the derivative of\nV with respect to its argument.And the problem is that while\nthis, taking derivatives,is a linear operation.If you take two derivatives\nof a sum of things,you take two\nderivatives of the firstplus two derivatives\nof the second.But yes, its-- this\nside is linear,but this side may not be linear.Because a potential\ncan be arbitrary.And that the\nreverse-- so supposethe potential is cubic in x.V of x goes like x cubed.Then the derivative of\nV goes like x squared,and x squared is not\na linear function.So this, Newton's equation,\nis not a linear equation.And therefore, it's\ncomplicated to solve.Very complicated to solve.So finally, we can get to\nour case, quantum mechanics.So in quantum mechanics,\nwhat do we have?Quantum mechanics is linear.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.416}, {"text": "First, you need an equation,\nand whose equation is it?Schrodinger's equation, 1925.He writes an equation for\nthe dynamical variable,and the dynamical\nvariable is somethingcalled the wave function.This wave function\ncan depend on t--depends on time-- and it may\ndepend on other things as well.And he describes the dynamics\nof the quantum systemas it evolved in time.There is the wave function,\nand you have an equationfor this wave function.And what is the equation\nfor this wave function?It's a universal\nequation-- i hbarpartial derivative with\nrespect to time of psiis equal to H hat of psi, where\nH hat is called the Hamiltonianand it's a linear operator.That's why I had to\nexplain a little bit whatthe linear operator is.This is the general structure\nof the Schrodinger equation--time derivative and\nthe linear operator.So if you wish to write the\nSchrodinger equation as an Lpsi equals 0, then L psi would\nbe defined i hbar del/delt of psi minus H hat psi.Then this is the\nSchrodinger equation.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.513}, {"text": "This equation here is\nSchrodinger's equation.And as you can see,\nit's a linear equation.You can check it, check\nthat L is a linear operator.Therefore, it is naturally\nlinear, you can see,because you do it differently,\nbecause the derivativewith respect to time\nis a linear operation.If you have the ddt of a\nnumber of times a function,the number goes out, you\ndifferentiate the function.ddt of the sum of two functions,\nyou differentiate the first,you differentiate.So this is linear and\nH we said is linear,so L is going to be linear\nand the Schrodinger equationis going to be a\nlinear equation,and therefore, you're going\nto have the great advantagethat any time you find\nsolutions, you can scale them,you can add them, you can put\nthem together, combine themin superpositions, and\nfind new solutions.So in that sense,\nit's remarkablethat quantum\nmechanics is simplerthan classical mechanics.And in fact, you will see\nthroughout this semesterhow the mathematics and\nthe things that we doare simpler in\nquantum mechanics,or more elegant, more\nbeautiful, more coherent,it's simpler and very nice.OK, i is the square root of\nminus 1, is the imaginary unit,and that's what we're\ngoing to talk nexton the necessity\nof complex numbers.hbar, yes, it's a number.It shows up in quantum\nmechanics early on.It it's called Planck's\nconstant and itbegan when Planck tried to\nfit the black value spectrumand he found the need to\nput a constant in there,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.527}, {"text": "and then later, Einstein figured\nout that it was very relevant,so yes, it's a number.For any physical\nsystem that you have,you will have a wave\nfunction and youwill have a Hamiltonian,\nand the Hamiltonianis for you to invent\nor for you to discover.So if you have a particle\nmoving on a line,the wave function will\ndepend on time and on x.If you have a particle\nmoving in three dimensions,it will depend on x vector.It may depend on\nother things as wellor it maybe, like, one particle\nhas several wave functionsand that happens when you\nhave a particle with spin.So in general, always\ntime, sometimes position,there may be cases where it\ndoesn't depend on position.You think of an electron at some\npoint in space and it's fixed--you lock it there and\nyou want understandthe physics of that\nelectron locked into place,and then position\nis not relevant.So what it does with\nits spin is relevantand then you may need more\nthan one wave function-- whatis one describing\nthe spin up and onedescribing the spin down?So it was funny that\nSchrodinger wrote this equationand when asked, so what\nis the wave function?He said, I don't know.No physical interpretation\nfor the wave functionwas obvious for the people that\ninvented quantum mechanics.It took a few months\nuntil Max Born saidit has to do with\nprobabilities, and that'swhat we're going to get next.So our next point is the\nnecessity of complex numbers", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.405}, {"text":
