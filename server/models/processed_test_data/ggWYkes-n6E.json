[{"text": "GILBERT STRANG: I would like\nyou to see the big pictureof linear algebra.We're not doing, in\nthis set of videos,a full course on linear algebra.That's already on\nOpenCourseWare 1806.And now I'm concentrating\non differential equations,but you got to see\nlinear algebra this way.And this way means subspaces.And there are four of\nthem in the big picture.And we-- previous video\ndescribed the column spaceand the null space.Now, we've got two\nmore, making four.And let me look at this\nmatrix-- it's for subspaces--and put them into\nthe big picture.So the first space I'll\nlook at is the row space.Now, the row space\nhas these rows--has the vector 1,\n2, 3 and the vector4, 5, 6, two vectors there,\nand all their combinations.That's the key idea in linear\nalgebra, linear combinations.So 1, 2, 3 is a vector in\nthree dimensional space.4, 5, 6 is another one.Now, if I take all\ntheir combinations,do you visualize that if I have\ntwo vectors, and I add them,and I get another vector\nthat's in the same plane?Or if I subtract them,\nI'm still in that plane.Or if I take five of one\nand three of another,I'm still in that plane.And I fill the plane when I\ntake all the combinations.So the row space-- can I\ntry to draw a picture here?It's a plane.This is the row space.I'll just put row.And in that plane are\nthe vectors 1, 2, 3and the vectors 4,\n5, 6, those two rows.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.332}, {"text": "And the plane fills\nour combinations.Well, I can't draw am infinite\nplane on this MIT blackboard.But you get the idea.It's a plane.And we're sitting\nin three dimensions.Now, the other--\nso there's more.We've only got one-- a\nplane here, a flat part,like a tabletop,\nextending to infinity,but not filling 3D because\nwe've got another direction.And in that other direction\nis the null space.That's the nice thing.So I would like to know the\nnull space of that matrix.I'd like to solve so the\nnull space, N of A-- I'msolving Av equals all 0s.So some combination\nof those three columnswill give me the 0 column.Let me write it\nin as a 0 column.What could v be?What combination of that column,\nthat column, and that columngive 0, 0?Now, I know there are some\ninteresting combinationsbecause I-- only amounts to two\nequations with three unknowns,v1, v2, v3.I want to multiply that by\nv1, that by v2, that by v3.So I have three unknowns,\nbut I've only two 0sto get, only two equations.And if I have three\nunknowns and two equations,there will be lots of solutions.And I can see one.Do you see that if I add\nthat and that, I get 4, 10And that's the same-- 4, 10\nis the same as 2 times 2, 5.In other words, I\nbelieve v equal--if I took 1 of the first\nand 1 of the third,and if I subtracted 2\nof the second column--so Av will give me 1\nof the first column, 1", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "of the third column,\nand subtracting2 of the second column\nwill give me 0, 0.So here's my null space.My null space heads\noff in this direction,in the direction\nof 1, minus 2, 1.But, of course, I\nget more solutionsby multiplying v by any number.10 times that vector would\nstill give me 0s and stillbe in the null space.So I really have--\nthe null spaceis a whole line of vectors.It's that vector and any\nmultiple of that vector.So it's a whole infinite line,\nwhich is a one dimensionalsubspace, the null space.So the null space\nin my picture--here is the null space.Well, it is not very thick is\nit because it's just a line.So I'll call this\nN of A, this line.Well, you see I'm trying to\ndraw a three dimensional space.That line goes both ways.But it's perpendicular\nto the plane.That's the fabulous part.That's wonderful.This line, the null space, is\nperpendicular to this plane,the row space.You want to know why?You want to just see it?Because if I take A\ntimes v, that would be 1,2, 3 times v. 1, 2, 3 is\nperpendicular to that.How do I check perpendicular\nfor two vectors?1, 2, 3 dot product.1, minus 2, 1, the dot product\nis 1 times 1, minus 2 times2-- that's 4-- plus\n3 times 1, that's 3.1 minus 4 plus 3 is 0.And, similarly, 4\nminus 10 plus 6 is 0.So this is a right angle

meeting, of course,\nat 0-- at the 0 vector.That solves Av equals\n0, and it also-- it'sa combination, a 0\ncombination of the rows.That's half of the big\npicture, the row spaceand the null space.Now, I'm ready for\nthe other half, whichis a second side of the\nother-- the right-hand sideof the big picture contains\nthe column space first of all.So what's the column\nspace of that matrix?So the column space\nof a matrix, wetake all combinations\nof those three columns.And that will fill out a space.Now, I have-- so I\ntake the vector 1, 4.And I take the vector\n2, 5, maybe there.And then I'm going to\nalso take the vector 3, 6.Well, I've got three columns.So I'm counting out 3, up 6.Good.Take those combinations of those\nvectors, and what do you get?This is a picture in\ntwo dimensional spacebecause these columns are in\ntwo dimensions, 1,4; 2, 5; 3, 6.When I take the combinations\nof 1, 4 and 2, 5,those are in\ndifferent directions.The combinations already

third column can't\ncontribute anything new.It's sitting in\nthe column space.It's a combination of those two.But the first two\nare independent.Their combinations\ngive the whole plane.So the column space\nis the whole plane.Column space.There's not much room\nfor our fourth subspace.But the fourth subspace, in\nthis example, is quite small.Let me tell you about the\nfourth subspaces then.So we know the\nnull space, N of A.And we know the column space,\nC of A. The null space wasin this picture.The column space\nwas in that picture.Now, what about-- what's\nthe name for the row space?Well, if I transpose the\nmatrix, the row spaceturns into the column space.Transpose rows into columns\nof the matrix A transpose.So by transposing a matrix,\nit turns these two rowsinto two columns.And that's what I have here.The row space is the--\nthis is the columnspace of the transpose matrix.I like it.I don't want to introduce a\nnew letter for the row space.I like having just column\nspace and null space.So I-- and I'm OK to\ngo to A transpose.Now, what's that fourth guy?Oh, just by beautifulness,\ngeneral principles of elegancehere.If I have columns space\nand null space of A,and if I have column\nspace of A transpose,the fourth guy has to be the\nnull space of A transpose.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Sorry, I wrote that\nso small, so small.But I did write this\na little larger.The null space of A\ntranspose, all the w'sthat solve that equation.A transpose w equals 0.The null space of A\ntranspose is all the w's thatsolve that equation.What does that\nequation looks like?Ha!Well, that equation--\nA transposewill have two columns.So A transpose-- this will\nbe w1 of the first column.1, 2, 3, when I transpose.And w2 of the second column,\n4, 5, 6 equaling 0, 0, 0.Well, now I've got, for this\nnull space-- because my matrixhere is 2 by 3, for\nthis fourth subspace,I have three equations and\nonly two unknowns, w1 and w2.And, in fact, the\nonly solutions arew1 equals 0, w2 equals\n0, because that'sthe only way I can get\ncombination-- that'sthe only combination\nof that vectorand that vector that gives\nme 0 is to take 0 of thatand zero of that.Do you see that the-- in\nthis example, the null spaceof A transpose is just--\nnull space of A transpose--is just what I call\nthe 0 subspace.The subspace that has\nonly one puny vectorin it, the 0 vector.But that's OK.It follows the\nrule for subspaces.And it completes the\npicture of four subspaces.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.104}, {"text": "In other examples, we could\nhave all four subspaces nonzero.But we would have two over\nhere that, together, completethe full N dimensional space.And over here, we have two that\ntogether complete the full Mdimensional space.And here, for this matrix, M was\n2, so that this is completed.The column space was\nall of R2 in this case.All of two dimensional\nspace was the column space,and that didn't leave any\nroom for the left null space,the null space of A transpose.So do you see that picture?Let we may be just sketch it\nonce more with a clean board.So I have the row space.Let me draw it maybe going\nthis way, the row space.And perpendicular to\nthat is the null space.That's in-- we're\nhere in N dimensions,and they are perpendicular,\nthose spaces.And then, over here, I\nhave the column space.And perpendicular to that\nis the left null space.And we're here in M dimensions.Those are our four subspaces.And they have-- they sit in N\ndimensional space, two of them,two of them in M dimensional\nspace, perpendicular.And I could tell you something\nabout their dimensions.So this row space, in that\nexample, was two dimensional.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.172}, {"text": "It was a plane.In general, the\ndimension equals--let's say R.

CanI say that wonderful\nfact in a sentence?The column space and the row\nspace have the same dimension.The number of independent\nrows equals the numberof independent columns.That's like a miracle for a\ngiant matrix, say 57 by 212,there might be 40\nindependent rows.Then, there would be\n40 independent columns.And then the null space\nand the left null spacehave the remaining dimension.So the null space has dimension\nN minus R because, altogether--together they have dimension N.And this has dimension M minus\nR because, together, theyhave dimension M.
