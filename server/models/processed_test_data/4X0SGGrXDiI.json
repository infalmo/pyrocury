first order equations, like\nthat one, first order dy dt.And the lectures next week will\nbe on second order equation.So we're looking for, you could\nsay, formulas for the solution.We'll get as far as we\ncan with formulas, thennumerical methods.Graphical methods take over\nin more complicated problems.This is a model problem.It's linear.I chose it to have\nconstant coefficient a,and let me check the units.Always good to see the\nunits in a problem.So let me think of this\ny, as the money in a bank,or bank balance, so y as in\ndollars, and t, time, in years.So we're looking at the ups\nand downs of bank balance y.The rate of change, so the\nunits then are dollars per year.So every term in the equation\nhas to have the right units.So y is in dollars,\nso the interest rate ais percent per\nyear, say 6% a year.So a could be 6%-- that's\ndimensionless-- per year,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.132}, {"text": "or half a percent per\nmonth if we change.So if we change\nunits, the constant awould change from 6 to a half.But let's stay with 6.And then q of t represents\ndeposits and withdrawals,so that's in dollars\nper year again.Has to be.So that's continuous.We think of the deposits\nand the interestas being computed continuously\nas time goes forward.So if that's a constant-- and\nI'll take that case first,q equal 1-- that would\nmean that we're putting in,depositing $1 per year,\ncontinuously through the year.So that's the model that comes\nfrom a differential equation.A difference equation would\ngive us finite time steps.So I'm looking for the solution.And with constant\ncoefficients, linear, we'regoing to get a formula\nfor the solution.I could actually deal\nwith variable interestrate for this one\nfirst order equation,but the formula becomes messy.But you can still do it.After that point, for a\nsecond order equationslike oscillation,\nor for a systemof several equations\ncoupled together,constant coefficients is\nwhere you can get formulas.So let's go with that case.So how to solve that equation?Let me take first of all, a\nconstant, constant source.So I think of q as\nthe source term.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.188}, {"text": "To get one nice formula, let me\ntake this example, ay plus 1,let's say.How do you find y\nof t to solve that?And you start with some\ninitial condition y of 0.That's the opening deposit\nthat you make at time 0.How to solve that equation?Well, we're looking\nfor a solution.And solutions to linear\nequations have two parts.So the same will happen\nin linear algebra.One part is a solution\nto that equation,so we're just looking\nfor one, any one,and we'll call it a\nparticular solution.And the associated null\nequation, dy dt equal ay.So this is an equation\nwith q equals 0.That's why it's called null.And it's also\ncalled homogeneous.So more textbooks use that\nlong word homogeneous,but I use the word null\nbecause it's shorterand because it's the same\nword in linear algebra.So let me call yn\nthe null solution,the general null solution.And y, I'm looking here for\na particular solution yp,and I'm going to-- here's\nthe key for linear equations.Let me take that off and\nfocus on those two

I\ncould put them together.If it was y squared, yp\nsquared and yn squaredwould not be the same\nas yp plus yn squared.It's the linearity that\ncomes, and then I add the 1.So what do I see from this?I see that yp plus yn\nalso solves my equation.So the whole family of\nsolutions is 1 yp plus any yn.And why do I say any yn?Because when I find\none, I find more.The solutions to\nthis equation areyn could be e to the at,\nbecause the derivative of eto the at does bring\ndown a factor a.But you see, I've left space\nfor any multiple of e to the at.This is where that long\nword homogeneous comes from.It's homogeneous means I can\nmultiply by any constant,and I still solve the equation.And of course, the\nkey again is linear.So now I have-- well, you could\nsay I've done half the job.I've

function.I guess every author\nand every teacherhas to think am I going\nto let this delta functioninto my course or into the book?And my answer is yes.You have to do it.You should do it.Delta

integrals.Integrals of things are nice.Do you think in your mind\nwhen you take derivatives,as we did going left to right,\nwe were taking derivatives.The function was getting crazy.When we go right to left, take\nintegrals, those are smoothing.Integrals make\nfunctions smoother.They cancel noise.They smooth the function out.So what we can do is to take the\nintegral of the delta function.We
