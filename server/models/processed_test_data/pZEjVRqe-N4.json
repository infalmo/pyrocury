time we'd given anintroduction to all the sort of\nnomenclature and things youneed to know, and we had just\ngotten up to d orbitals, andwhen you're talking about\ntransition metals you'retalking about d orbitals.So, we're going to start with a\nlittle review of d orbitals,some of you have seen\nthis before, maybesome of you have not.But here is what you're\ngoing to need toknow about the d orbitals.You need to know the names of\nall the d orbitals, you shouldbe able to draw the shapes of\nthe d orbitals, and so the baris not too high for this.You see the drawings that are\nin your handouts, you shouldbe able to do about that\nwell, it doesn'thave to be super fancy.But you should be able to draw\ntheir shapes, and you shouldalso be able to recognize which\nd orbital it is -- ifyou have a picture of different\nd orbitals, youshould be able to name\nthat d orbital.So let's just review what the\nd orbitals look like.And in this class, we're always\ngoing to have the samereference frame, so we're\nalways going to have thez-axis up and down, the y-axis\nis horizontal, and the x-axisis coming out of the board\nand going into the board.So, we'll always use that\nsame description.It'll often be given, but if\nit's not, you can assumethat's what we're\ntalking about.So, the first d orbital we'll\nconsider is d z squared.It has its maximum amplitude\nalong the z-axis, and it alsohas a little donut\nin the x y plane.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So, d x squared minus y squared\nhas its maximumamplitude along the x and the\ny axis, so directly on-axisfor this particular d orbital.The next sets of d orbitals have\ntheir maximum amplitudesoff-axis, so they don't\ncorrespond directly to theaxes that I just mentioned,\nthey're, infact, 45 degrees off-axis.So we have the d y z shown here,\nd x z shown here, somaximum amplitude 45 degrees off\nz and x axes, and then z-- these pictures are a little\nbit complicated to see -- d xy, so it's 45 degrees off\nof the x and the y.And so, here I tried to draw\nthem all in the sameorientation of axes, which is\na little bit difficult.So now let's look at them in\nterms of where they're drawnso you can kind of see them a\nlittle bit better, and so whydon't you try to learn to\nrecognize all of these.So, what is this one called?\nd z squared.What is this one, so its maximum\namplitude is along xand y? d x squared\nminus y squared.I think this picture might be\na little -- you might havesomewhat aversion later on, but\nthis is just good practicefor you in recognizing them.So here we have one 45 degrees\noff-axis, which one is this?Yup.And this one over here?Yup.So, y z.And this last one here?Yup, we have the x z,\nso it's going up and", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.206}, {"text": "down for the for z-axis.So, a little more\npractice now.To show what these look like\nagain, you want to think inthree dimensions, and on paper\nand in most the time inPowerpoint you're not in three\ndimension, so here's a littlemovie in three dimensions.Here you can really see that\ndonut, so this is d x squared-- see the maximum amplitude\nalong z-axis here, and downhere, and the little donut\nin the x y plane.So this one is d x squared\nminus y squared.The maximum amplitudes are right\ndirectly along axis, sothat allows you to distinguish\nit from d x y.So when it's on-axis\nhere, it's the xsquared minus y squared.So moving along here, so this is\nd x y, so you see that it'sin that axis but it's not\ndirectly on-axis -- themaximum amplitude is 45 degrees\noff, so the orbitalsare in between the axes there.Now we're looking at one that\nhas a z in it, and it lookslike it's x z, so that's where\nour maximum amplitude isbetween the x and the z-axes,\n45 degrees off.And our last one, we\nhave y and z here.Again, 45 degrees off-axis\nbetween the y-axis and z-axis.So, hopefully these little\nmovies will help cement inyour brain, what the shapes\nof these d orbitals are.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.192}, {"text": "All right, so that's d orbitals,\nand we're going tobe mentioning d orbitals in\nevery lecture in this, and youhave to be thinking about what\nthe shapes of the d orbitalsare to talk about today's\ntopic, which iscrystal field theory.So, there are two types of\ntheories that you may hear ofand that your book mentions --\ncrystal field theory, andligand field theory, and like\nmost things that you learnabout in freshman chemistry, the\ntheories were developed toexplain experimental\ninformation.So there are special properties\nof coordinationcomplexes, so that's where you\nhave a transition metal in themiddle and you have ligands\nall around it, so you havethese coordination complexes\nand they have specialproperties.And so people wanted to try to\nrationalize these specialproperties and they came up\nwith these two theories.So, the basic idea behind these\ntheories is that whenyou place a metal ion with the\nparticular oxidation number inthe center of a coordination\nsphere, and you have all theseligands, these donor ligands,\nall surrounding them, that theenergy of the d orbitals is\ngoing to be altered by theposition of those ligands.So it's all about the d\norbitals, and the d orbitalsare going to experience some\ninfluence from these ligands,these donor ligands that are\nsurrounding the metal.So then, between these two\ntheories that are used toexplain how these d orbitals\nare being affected.The crystal field theory is\nbased on an ionic description,so it considers the ligands\nas negative point charges.It's a very simplified model,\nwhereas as the ligand fieldtheory considers covalent, as\nwell as ionic aspects of", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.223}, {"text": "coordination.It's more powerful it's more\nuseful, but it's also a bitmore complex, and so we don't\ncover it in this of course,and if you go on and take the\nfirst level of inorganicchemistry, which is 503, then\nyou'll hear about this.But for this course, we're\njust going to talk aboutcrystal field theory.Even though it's very much\nof a simplified model, itactually works very well.You can explain quite a few\nproperties of coordinationcomplexes just using this\nsimplified method.So, crystal field theory,\nagain, very simple.It's just considering the\nionic interactions, itconsiders the ligands as\nnegative point charges.And so, the basic idea is that\nligands, as negative pointcharges, are going to have\nrepulsive effects if they getclose to the d orbitals.So here is a drawing of a metal,\nand so this is metalabbreviated m, its oxidation\nnumber is m plus here, and ithas ligands all around it.What is the geometry here?It's octahedral geometry.And so we have ligands up and\ndown along z, ligands along y,and a ligand going back\nalong x, and a ligandcoming out along x.And so here's another picture\nof the same thing, the metalis in the middle, and the\nligands -- in this case, youhave these ammonia ligands or\nthese little negative pointcharges, which are all\nalong the axes.You have four along the\nequatorial, and one up and onedown, so this is the octahedral\ngeometry.And so you can just think about\neach of these ligands asnegative point charges.And so, if the negative point\ncharge is pointing righttoward a d orbital, that'll\nbe very repulsive.If it's not it's\nless repulsive.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.271}, {"text": "That's the whole idea behind\nthis crystal field theory.So, here again, is just another\nlittle picture, so youcan kind of get the idea that\nwe're going to be thinkingabout the all the shapes of\nthe d orbitals, and we'regoing to think about where\nthe ligands are.Today we're going to talk about\noctahedral geometry, butwe're also going to go on and\ntalk about tetrahedralgeometry later.So here in octahedral geometry,\nyou can think aboutthe positions of all of these\nnegative point chargessurrounding your d orbitals.And when the d orbitals are\non axis, like the ligands,there's going to be more\nrepulsion, so you can see herethat would be quite repulsive\n-- you have a negative pointcharge by that d orbital.When the d orbitals are off-axis\nand the ligands areon-axis, that's less\nrepulsive.And that's the basic idea.So, let's look at each one of\nthese orbitals now in detailand think about how a ligands\nthat's pointing directlytoward it is going\nto be affected.So we have the ligands, l, as\nthese point charges directedtoward the d z squared, and\nthe d x squared minus ysquared orbitals, and these\nwould result inquite a bit of repulsion.So if you had a ligand right up\nhere along z, and so thatwould be a very close\ninteraction.In this case, you're going to\nhave ligands along x and y,again pointing directly toward\nthe orbitals, that would bequite repulsive.And I'll just mention, we'll\ncome back to this later, thatone can think about the case\nwhere you have the octahedralgeometry where the ligands are\nin a definite position, andyou can also think about this\nsort of hypothetical casewhere you have a metal in the\nmiddle and you have theligands, here are the little\nligands, and they'reeverywhere, there's ligands\neverywhere all around.And so, in this case where you\nhave ligands everywhere all", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.232}, {"text": "around your metal, then all your\nd orbitals would have thesame energy, but if you take\nthe ligands and you isolatethem in particular positions,\nthen you can consider how thedifferent shapes of the d\norbitals will be affected.We'll come back to\nthat in a minute.All right, so here we have a\ncase where our ligands areon-axis, our orbitals on-axis,\nthis is a large repulsion.So, I will tell you that d x\nsquared and d z squared and dx squared minus y squared\norbitals are destabilized, andthey are destabilized\nby the same amount.So there's repulsion now, and\nso they're destabilized, andthey're destabilized by the\nsame amount of energy.So what's it called\nwhen orbitalsare of the same energy?Yup.So, d z squared and d x squared\nminus y squared aredegenerate.So, d z squared and d x squared\nminus y squaredorbitals are destabilized more\nthan the other three orbitals,and let's consider now\nwhy that is true.So here are our other sets of\norbitals, and remember, herethe maximum amplitude of these\norbitals are 45 degreesoff-axis, whereas our ligands\nare all on-axis.So, the ligand negative charges\nare directed inbetween these orbitals, not\ndirectly toward them.So that is stabilized compared\nto this hypothetical casewhere the ligands are\neverywhere, so some of themwill be pointing toward them,\nand also stabilized comparedto the other sets of orbitals\nwhere the ligands are nowpointing directly at them.So these three sets of orbitals\nare stabilizedrelative to the d z squared and\nthe d x squared minus y", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.176}, {"text": "squared orbitals, and they're\nstabilized by the same amount.So these three orbitals are also\ndegenerate with respectto each other.So then to sort of summarize\nthis set of orbitals, we havefor d z squared and d x squared\nminus y squared, wehave large repulsions by those\nnegative point charges,they're pointing directly at the\norbitals, and so they'redestabilized, higher in energy\nthan the other -- the d x y, dy z and d x z.For the d y z, d x z and d x y,\nthey're smaller repulsion,because these orbitals are\noff-axis, and so the negativepoint charges aren't pointing\ndirectly at them.So they're stabilized relative\nto these guys up here.So that's the whole idea behind\nan octahedral case ofcrystal field theory.And we can look at this\njust one other way, ifpictures help you.Here it's a little clearer\nthat those negative pointcharges are pointing directly\ntoward the orbitals, here Ithink you can see that the\nnegative point charges are notdirectly pointing toward\nany of the orbitals.So I'll show you a bunch of\ndifferent figures, this allshows you the same thing, but\nsome might help you see thisrelationship better.OK, so now we're going to draw\nsome diagrams. I'm going tostart over here.So we're going to draw what's\ncalled a crystal fieldsplitting diagram, and this\nis for an octahedral case.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.121}, {"text": "And the diagrams are going to\nlook different depending onwhat the geometry is.So when we draw this diagram,\nenergy is going up, and we'regoing to start with our 5 d\norbitals, and so this is goingto be the average

in theoctahedral case yet, our\noctahedral diagram's going tobe over here, but this is the\ncase that this represents.If you have all your ligands\nspherically distributed aroundyour metal, then the energy\nof all the d orbitals areidentical, because every d\norbital has the same amount ofligands, it's uniform,\nit's symmetricalall around the metal.And I just want to tell you that\nthis is was very excitingto me when I saw this.I've been teaching this class\nfor a while, and I never had areal spherical crystal field\naround my metal before.And then I walked into Walgreens\none day, and I

dog,\netcetera, butthis was really amazing.So I asked the cashier on the\nway out whether they knew theywere selling spherical\ncrystal fields, andthey did not actually.So, you just never know what\nyou're going to get.OK, so in that case, where the\nligands are uniform all", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.124}, {"text": "around, the energy\nis the same.But now, if we have an\noctahedral crystal field overhere, so we have our octahedral\ncrystal field, thenwe get some splitting.So some of our orbitals are\ngoing to be destabilized, andthey'll be higher\nin energy here.So we have the d x squared\nminus y squared, and d zsquared over here are going\nto be higher in energy.And we're going to have three\nthat lower in energy, so we'llhave our d x y, our d y z, and\nour d x z over here,

examples of this.So let's look at an example,\nand we're going to have achromium system that has\nthree n h 3 ligandsand three b r ligands.Now, you tell me what the\nd count of that is.Let's just take 10\nmore seconds.They're not as high overall, but\nstill more people got theright answer.So, let's take a look at this.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "What's the oxidation\nnumber of

let'sconsider what happens in\nthe octahedral case.So we can come down here.Am I going to put my first\nelectron down here or up here?Down.Oh, I just realized that I\ndidn't put two things on

should have --", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "OK, so I'll write that out.So, this is the crystal field\nstabilization energy.So it's not the crystal field\nsplitting energy, it's thestabilization energy, which\nindicates how much thoseelectrons are stabilized by\nbeing in an octahedral field,rather than this hypothetical\nspherical crystal field.And so what we can do there is\nyou see that you have threeelectrons in those lower sets\nof orbitals, and thoseorbitals are stabilized by 2/5\ntimes the octahedral crystalfield splitting energy.And so that gives an answer

field.So, with the weak field there's\nnot that much of anenergy difference\nbetween them.And so, when you're putting in,\nyou do your first threeelectrons, that's always\ngoing to be the same.But then the fourth electron, in\nthis case, if there's not abig difference in the energy, if\nit's pretty small, if it'sa weak field, you can put that\nfourth one up there.Because it takes energy to pair\nthe electrons up, and soyou're asking the question, does\nit take more energy topair them, or does it take\nmore energy to put onein the upper set?And for a weak field you say\nthat the crystal fieldsplitting energy is smaller than\nthe pairing energy or pe, so p e is the\npairing energy.And so it takes more energy to\npair than it does to bump oneelectron up to the\nhigher level.So that's what a weak field\nsituation would look like.Now in a strong field situation,\nboy, there's a bigsplitting difference, a big\nenergy difference here.So in this case, the crystal\nfield splitting is

we\nhave our d n electronconfiguration, so we\nhave three in the t2 g, we have three.And in the e g set we have one,\nso that is our electronconfiguration for this\nweak field case.And for the strong field case,\nwe didn't put any up in the eg, so we just have t\n2 g, four electronsin that set of orbitals.OK, so let's just put up what\nwe've done here, and introduceanother term, which are high\nspin and low spin.So we have these two cases\nhere, and again, we'reconsidering how big is this\noctahedral crystal fieldsplitting energy compared\nto a pairing energy.The energy involved in pairing\nelectrons together.In a weak field, the splitting\nenergy is small, so electronsare placed singly with spins\nparallel to the fullest extentin all the sets of orbitals.In this other case with

two\npossibilities.So, for this system, is this\ngoing to be a high spin or alow spin system?So, this will be high spin,\nbecause we have the maximumamount of unpaired electrons.And over here we're going to\nhave a low spin system.We have the minimum\nnumber possible ofthe unpaired electrons.All right, so let's finish this\nup now, and do our d nelectron configurations\nand our crystalfield splitting energies.So, for this case, we're going\nto have in our t 2g system, how many?5.And in e g?2.", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.727}, {"text": "And for our splitting energy,\nwe have 5 times minus 2/5times the octahedral crystal\nfield splitting energy plus 2times plus 3/5, and what does\nthat end up equaling?Minus 4/5 times the\noctahedral crystalfield splitting energy.And we could also optionally put\n2 p e because we have twosets paired.All right, so let's look at\nour strong field system.How many do we have\nin our e 2 g set?6.What about e g?1.And for our splitting energy\nthen, we have 6 times minus2/5 times the octahedral crystal\nfield splitting energyplus 1 times 3/5, and what\nis that going to equal?Minus what?9/5.And how many pairing energies?\nthree pairing energies, great.I think you have\nthat part down.Next time we get more\ncomplicated, we're going totalk about types of ligands,\nwe're going to talk abouttetrahedral, we're going to talk\nabout square planar, andthat's, of course, after\nthe exam on Wednesday.So, good luck, everyone, with\nthe exam on Wednesday.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.722}]
