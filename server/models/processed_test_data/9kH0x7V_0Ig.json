demand\nrelationships andunderstanding how\nmarkets work.Now we're going to step back and\nget behind the supply anddemand curves and understand\nwhere those curvesthemselves come from.So we talked about, given that\nwe have supply and demandcurves, how they interact.Now we're going to get behind\nthat and see where thesecurves actually come from.Thank you, by the way\nfor coming down.I appreciate it.So what we're going to do is,\nwe're going to start with thedemand curve, and we're going to\nspend the next few lecturestalking about consumers and how\nconsumer preferences areultimately what leads\nto the constructionof the demand curve.Then after that and after the\nfirst exam-- that will coverwhat's on the first exam--after the first exam, we'll\nstart talking about firms andwhat determines the\nfirm supply curve.So today we'll talk about\nconsumers and we're going totalk about where the demand\ncurve comes from.And where it comes from, and\nwhere all consumer behaviorcoming from in economics is\nfrom utility maximization.That's where everything with\nconsumers starts is withutility maximization.That's the basic building block\nof consumer behavior.And basically, utility\nmaximization--that's what this lecture will\nbe about, describing it.But basically, an overview\nis, we posit some type ofpreferences.We posit consumer preferences,\nwhat consumers would like.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.121}, {"text": "We posit some budget constraint,\nwhat resourcesconsumers have to get\nwhat they'd like.And then we do a constrained\nmaximization problem thatsays, given your preferences,\ngiven what you'd like, subjectto the resources you have\navailable, whatchoices will you make?And in particular, we're going\nto ask, the term we'll use iswe'll ask what bundle of goods\nmakes you the best off?Given your preference, given\nyour constraints,what bundle of goods?So think about consumers\nchoosingacross a set of goods.Typically, we'll think about two\ngoods because graphs areeasier to think about two\ndimensions than more.So we'll typically think about\ntrading off two goods.So think about consumers with\npreferences across two goods,some budget they can\nallocate, and howthey make those choices.But this basic framework applies\nto the multiplicity ofchoices we all make along\nmany, many dimensions.So doing two dimensions as one\nof the simplifying assumptionsI'll talk about.But that's just a simplifying\nassumption.So basically what we we're going\nto do is we're going togo through this in three\nsteps, not just in thislecture, but over the\nnext few lectures.Step one, is we're going to talk\nabout what assumptions wemake about preferences.So I'll talk today about\npreference assumptions.So the axioms that underlie how\neconomists model consumerpreferences.We'll then talk about how we\ntranslate these preferencesassumptions into mathematical\ntractability through the useof the utility function, which\nis basically a mathematicalrepresentation of underlying\nconsumer preferences.So we'll talk about how we\nbasically take thesepreferences and translate them\ninto something that we canwork with here at MIT by making\nit mathematical, bymaking a utility function.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.329}, {"text": "And then finally, we'll talk\nabout budget constraints.And armed with these three\nthings, we'll then be able tomodel how consumers\nmake decisions.Now, importantly for today's\nlecture, we are not dealingwith budget constraints.So this is not happening\ntoday.So today we're not going to\nworry about the budgetconstraints.Today we're in a world where\nwe're just going to talk aboutwhat people want and we're going\nto put out of our mindwhether or not they\ncan afford it.So just talk about people want,\nand we'll put out ofmind for today.We'll come back next time to\nwhether they can afford it.We're just going to think\nabout unconstrainedpreferences for today's\nlecture.So let's talk about our\npreference assumptions.So, to model consumers'\npreferences across goods,we're going to impose three\npreference assumptions.Three preference assumptions.Assumption one--now once again, let me remind\nyou from the first lecture,this is getting to some of\nthe harder material.I'm going to write messily and\ntalk quickly, so stop me ifanything is unclear.And if you don't stop me, I'll\njust go faster and fasteruntil I explode.So basically, feel free to\ninterrupt and stop me withquestions and such.Three assumptions\non preferences.The first assumption\nis completeness.The first assumption is the\nassumption of completeness.When comparing two bundles of\ngoods, you prefer one or theother, but you don't\nvalue them equally.OK when comparing two bundles\nof goods, you prefer one oryou prefer the other, but\nyou're not indifferent.Completeness is the same\nas no indifference.So what we're saying is whenever\nI offer you twobundles of goods, you\ncould always tell mewhat you like better.Now it could be infinitesimally\nbetter.I'm not saying you have to\nhave strong preferences.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.339}, {"text": "But you cannot say\nI'm indifferent.You can never be purely\nindifferent.There always at least some\nslight preference for onebundle of goods over another.That's the completeness\nassumption.This is an assumption we make.Now in reality, oftentimes\nwe are indifferent.Well once again, this is one\nof these simplifyingassumptions that will\nmake the model work.And in fact, in reality if\nforced, you can always decidewhether you like one thing\nbetter than another, we justoften follow heuristic rules\nwhich say we're roughlyindifferent.We're just going to say, more\nprecisely, you are neverpurely indifferent.So, I'm not sure is\nnot an option.You can never say I don't know,\nI don't know which Iprefer, I'm indifferent.I'm sorry, let me back up.I'm using the wrong word.Forget I said indifferent,\nbecause we'll want to use thatword in a different\ncontext later.You can't say, I'm not sure.You can't say, I'm not sure.You can't say, I'm not sure,\ncan't say I don't know, Idon't know how I feel\nabout that.Scratch what I said a few\nminutes ago, because I want touse indifference differently.Completeness is not about not\nbeing different, we're goingto use that.What I'm saying is it's\nabout not being sure.You've got to value every\nbundle of goods.You've got to be willing to\nvalue every bundle of goodsthat's given you.So you can't say that I don't\nknow, I don't know how I feelabout that.You've got to have some\nfeeling about stuff.You can't say I'm not sure.You've got to have a complete\nset of preferences over allbundles of goods that\nare given you.OK, that's completeness.The second is transitivity.Which is something we've been\nlearning since kindergartenabout transitivity, right?And also, it's a different\ncontext.That's just if you prefer x to\ny, and y to z, you've got toprefer x to z.OK, you guys should\ndo transitivity inyour sleep by now.OK, so the standard transitivity\nwe always assumein math class, we're going\nto assume here as well.OK, that should be pretty\nnoncontroversial.OK, and then finally, and\nprobably most controversial,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.39}, {"text": "is we're going to assume\nnon-satiation.Or the famous economic\nassumption thatmore is always better.OK.More is always better, that is,\nyou never would turn downhaving more.Now we're going to talk later\ntoday and tomorrow about whyyou might not like the next unit\nas much as you like thecurrent unit.But you'll always like\nit greater than zero.You're always happy\nto have more.You never say, I've had enough,\nI literally value atzero the next unit.You may value it as epsilon, but\nyou'll always value it asgreater than zero.That's the non-satiation\nassumption,more is always better.Now, this is the most\ncontroversial.And obviously we can think\nof many contexts inwhich that's not true.But if we don't allow for this\nassumption, the modeling getsa lot trickier.So once again, let's put\nit out of our mind.Realistically, we know once\nwe've eaten a certain amount,we literally do not\nwant any more.OK, so we're going to\nput that aside.Assume we're always in a space\nwhere we can always eat alittle bit more.OK, we'll call it the\nJewish mother space.OK, you can always eat\na little bit more.OK, you can always eat\na little bit more.We're just going to assume we're\nin that space for now.OK.And so, for large ranges,\nwe can see it is not anunreasonable assumption.Although, I think in extremes,\nyou could see this becomesunreasonable.OK, so those are assumptions.Completeness, which once\nagain, I screwed up indescribing.Come back to the second way I\ndescribed it, which means youcan't say you're not sure.You always have preferences\nover things.That doesn't seem\nunreasonable.Transitivity which we've been\nliving with since we werekindergartners.And non-satiation, which could\nbe a little controversial, butwe'll live with it for now.Now given these, we're going to\ntalk about the propertiesof what we call indifference\ncurves.This is why I screwed\nup before.Of course you can be indifferent\nbetween things.That's the whole point\nof economics.I don't know why I\ngot that wrong.I haven't taught this

adecision you have to make.Now I tried to think of a cool\nway to make this example cool,and I just couldn't.So its going to be\na boring example.It's going to be, imagine your\nparents gave you some

So you havean indifference curve that runs\nbetween A and B. Thatmeans that all, and I'm assuming\nthat all combinationsalong this curve, you're\nindifferent.So you're equally happy getting\ntwo pizzas and onemovie or one pizza\nand two movies.But point C, which is two pizzas\nand two movies is on adifferent indifference curve.You're not indifferent between\npoint C and points A and B.You're indifferent\nbetween A and B--I'm just assuming this, I'm\nnot saying you are.But I'm just assuming, let's\nimagine you are.But you clearly like two pizzas\nand two movies betterthan one of one and\ntwo of the other.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Does that break the\ncompleteness rule for the--PROFESSOR: Does that break it?Why would that break it?AUDIENCE: Do you prefer\npizza over moviesor movies over pizza?PROFESSOR: No.Because this is my\nscrew up before.Completeness just means you\nknow how you feel abouteverything.So strike from the record\nmy initial description.Completeness means you just\nknow how you feel abouteverything.You're allowed to\nbe indifferent.Completeness just means you\ncan't say, I don't know, Idon't know how I feel\nabout pizza.You've got to have feelings\nfor pizza.OK.You've got to know how\nyou feel about stuff.That's what completeness is.So armed with those assumptions,\nthere are fourkey properties of indifference\ncurves that we haveto keep track of.Four key properties of\nindifference curves.The first is that consumers\nprefer higherindifference curves.So you prefer higher\nindifference curves.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.324}, {"text": "Prefer higher indifference\ncurves.What I mean by that is, the\nfurther out the indifferencecurve, the more you prefer it.And this comes naturally from\nthe non-satiation assumption.Given that we've assumed\nnon-satiation, you must alwaysprefer an indifference curve\nthat's further from the originbecause it's more, and\nmore is better.OK so given non-satiation,\nyou will always prefer anindifference curves that are\nfurther from the origin.That follows directly\nfrom non-satiation.The second point is that\nindifference curves are alwaysdownward sloping.Indifference curves are always\ndownward sloping.Indifference curves are always\ndownward sloping.And that, once again, comes\nfrom non-satiation.To see this, let's look at the\nnext figure, an upward slopingindifference curve.Why does an upward sloping\nindifference curve, someonetell me, violate\nnon-satiation.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Because you're\nindifferent to getting more.PROFESSOR: Yeah.Because this would say\nyou're indifferentbetween (1,1) and (2,2).It's not quite drawn right.We ought to just have this go\nthrough to point (2,2).But basically, this would say\nyou're indifferent betweengetting one pizza and\none movie or twopizzas and two movies.You can't be because that\nviolates more is better.So indifference curves can't be\nupward sloping, they've gotto be downward sloping by the\nnon-satiation assumption.OK, that's the second property\nof indifference curves.The third property of\nindifference curves isindifference curves\ncannot cross.Indifference curves\ncannot cross.Why can't indifference\ncurves cross?Well here I forgot to have\nJessica do a pretty diagram,so you'll have to deal with\nmy ugly handwriting here.So why can't indifferent\ncurves cross?", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.4}, {"text": "Well imagine a situation\nwhere you have yourpizza and your movies.And imagine a situation where\nyou have one indifferencecurve that looks like this,\nand one indifference curvethat looks like this.OK, two indifference curves.And you've got, let's label\nthese points A, B, and C.Now could someone give me, based\non the properties ofindifference curves that we\ntalked about over here, giventhese three properties,\ncan someone tell mewhy this is a violation?Yeah?AUDIENCE: Because A and B are\non the same curve, meaningyou're indifferent between A and\nB. A and C are also on thesame curve because you're\nindifferent between the two.But that means you're also\nindifferent between B and Cwhich can't be true because\nmore is better.PROFESSOR: Exactly.So transitivity says I must then\nbe indifferent between Band C through the logic\nyou just laid out.But I can't be indifferent\nbetween B and C because Bdominates C. B has a basically\nthe same number of movies, butmore pizza, so I must\nlike B better.So by the combination of\ntransitivity and non-satiationindifference curves\ncan't cross.And finally, completeness, which\nis the most awkward ofthese assumptions, it simply\nmeans you can't have more thanone indifference curve\nthrough a point.So basically, the idea of every\npossible bundle has

theory.Now I was an undergrad here,\ntook this course, but I neverreally understood indifference\ncurves until I had a year offwith a grad student who was\ntrying to decide where to takea job and he

goods\nare homogeneous.Is it the same movie\nwatched four times?Or different movies?PROFESSOR: Actually, that's\na great question.And you have to specify that\nas part of the problem.I haven't specified that here.Obviously it can't be the same\npizza eaten four times.It could be the same kind of\npizza eaten four times.But do you see the same movie?I haven't specified that here.So there's not a general\nassumption about that.It depends on how\nI define movies.Did I define movies as--I don't know.God, I'm terrible.All I know that's out now is\nthe Guardians of G'ahoolebecause I've got a little kid\nwho is interested in it.Whatever movie's out.Do I define movies as Guardians\nof G'ahoole, or do Idefine movies as\nseeing a movie?And I didn't specify that.Implicit in my examples,\nI specifymovies as seeing a movie.But you have to specify that to\nbe more precise if you'reactually trying to\nfigure out--it depends what you're\nmaximizing over.If you're maximizing over seeing\nany movie or maximizeover seeing the same movie.And I didn't specify here.AUDIENCE: It can work\nin both cases.PROFESSOR: It would work\nin both cases.Clearly you could imagine,\nactually it's a very goodpoint, where do you think your\nmarginal utility woulddiminish more?Seeing the same movie.So what your example points out\nis that different goodswill have different rates of\ndiminishing marginal utility.OK, so marginal utility will\nalways be diminishing, but atvery different rates for\ndifferent goods.", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.769}, {"text": "So the general principle is\nthat they'll be

preference maps.Let's ask, given what we know\nabout utility, what can thisteach us about the shape\nof preference maps?What's the linkage between\nutility and preference maps?And that linkage comes through\nsomething we call the marginalrate of substitution.The marginal rate of\nsubstitution is themathematical concept that links\npreference utility withpreference maps.The marginal rate of\nsubstitution technically isthe slope of the indifference\ncurve.It's delta P over delta M. The\nslope of the indifferencecurve is the marginal rate\nof substitution.That's what it means\ngraphically, but here's whatyou have to understand\nat a deeper level.What it really is, it's\nthe rate which you arewilling to trade off.The rate at which you are\nwilling to trade off they-axis for the x-axis.The rate at which you're\nwilling to tradeoff pizza for movies.So that's what it

figure 4-6.The MRS is the slope of that\ncurve telling you the rate atwhich you're willing to trade\noff pizza for movies.Now just a side note here,\nyou're never, of course,actually trading.There's not some market\nwhere you bring apizza and get a movie.So I didn't say trade, it's\nnot like baseball cards.I said trade off.What I mean is ultimately you\nhave some budget, and you haveto allocate that budget.So if you decide to allocate\nit on pizzas, you can'tallocate it on movies.Or the more you allocate on\npizzas, the less you canallocate on movies.So there's always a trade-off.Remember, I said, economics is\nalways about trade-offs.Given your limited budget,\nthere's always a trade off.And the rate at which you're\nwilling to trade off is yourmarginal rate of substitution.Given that you're going to have\nto trade off-- and wehaven't got a bunch of\nconstraints yet, we'll get tothat next time--the rate at which you're willing\nto is your marginalrate of substitution.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Is that rate usually\nrelated to the price?PROFESSOR: Ultimately no.I'm sorry.The marginal rate of\nsubstitution purely comes fromyour preferences.Ultimately to decide how much\nyou actually consume, you'llneed to bring in the price.So remember, I haven't talked\nabout prices here, we haven'ttalked about that here.But this is a preference\nconcept.This has nothing to\ndo with prices.But you're getting\nahead of us.We'll see next time, to decide\nhow much you actually consume,you're going to relate the\nmarginal rate of substitutionto the prices you face\nin the market.And that will decide

the\nnext lecture and face a budgetconstraint, you're going to have\nto decide how do I wantto allocate my budget across\npizzas and movies?The way you're going to decide\nthat is by the relationship
