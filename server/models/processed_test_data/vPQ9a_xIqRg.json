I'm going\nto be your instructorthis semester.So what I want to do today\nis to introduce my plans.I've got plans for you.Plans for learning.I want to talk a little bit\ntoday about those plans,introduce myself, introduce\nmy class curriculum--the path forward.So let me begin by saying that\n3.091 is the most importantclass you will take at MIT.It's true.But, you know, anybody who\nstands in front of you tolecture should say the same\nthing about his or her class.If they don't believe that they\nshouldn't be standing infront of you lecturing.The difference is when\nI say it, I'm right.[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR: And it's not just\nan opinion, it's because ofthe content of 3.091.3.091 is about chemistry.It's about the central science,\nbut it's not justabout any old chemistry.This isn't a class that you\ncould take anywhere else inthis country.This is the only place that\nyou can take 3.091.3.091 is solid state\nchemistry.Now why do we talk about\nsolid state chemistry?Because engineering systems\nare made of solids.Now I know what you're\nthinking-- oh, he said solidstate, he's going to talk\nabout the chemistry thatconstitutes his laptop computer\nor the chemistry thatconstitutes this\nlaser pointer.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.171}, {"text": "And that's true.We will talk about\nthat chemistry.But we will also talk\nabout soft matter.We as human beings are\nchemical machines.When this hand changes shape,\nit is a polymer that ischanging conformality.These eyes are photodetectors,\nband gap of abouttwo electron volts.They're not made of\ngallium nitride.They're made of organic\ncompounds.Inside, what supports us,\nit's a ceramic skeleton.So solid state chemistry\ndescribeslife science as well.Well, what we're going\nto learn in3.091 is the rudiments.We're going to learn\nthe rudiments.So what I'm going to do today is\nnow go through some of thebasic organization.So tomorrow you're going\nto meet your recitationinstructors and get to know each\nother and get to know therecitation instructor.Today I'll say a few words about\nmyself so you know who'sstanding in front of you.I graduated from the University\nof Toronto inchemical metallurgy, came down\nhere in 1977 to spend a yearas a postdoctoral fellow and, I\nguess, I lost track of time.Now what's my research?My research is in\nelectrochemistry.Electrochemistry is the most\nimportant branch of chemistry.Do you notice some theme in\nmy professional life?See, I have tenure.So what does that mean?It means you find your passion\nand pursue it.You don't waste time on\ntrivia, all right?And that's what I urge\nyou to do: Find yourpassion and pursue it.So what's my passion?My passion is electrochemistry\nin nonaqueous media.Anything but water.Let the rest of the world\nwork on water.I work on molten salts, ionic\nliquids, and polymers.And what's the reason\nfor this?", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.368}, {"text": "There's an application.I'm in the School\nof Engineering.So I'm interested in\nenvironmentally soundtechnologies for metal\nproduction, all right?Right now looking at titanium,\niron recycling as well.I'm also interested in\nelectrochemistry as it appliesto energy storage, energy\nstorage for mobile power.See this gal here?She's got the cell phone.She's not even looking\nwhere she's driving.[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR: So making safe\nbatteries out ofearth-abundant, accessible\nmaterials for portable power,ultimately to drive the car with\nelectrons, electric fuel,to eliminate this country'sdependence on imported petroleum.We can do it.How?By inventing.By inventing.And the way we're going to\ninvent is to learn the lessonsin 3.091 that will give us the\nchemistry we need to invent abattery that can send that car\n250 miles on a single charge,and put it in a show room for\nthe same price as a car withan internal combustion engine.The only thing that stands\nbetween that image and wherewe are today is invention, and\nthe requisite material isright here in this class.We're also looking at\ncolossal batteries.Store the grid.Enable renewables,\nwind, solar.And then, lastly, let's never\nforget about dreaming.So if we want to dream and\nimagine that man will returnto the moon or maybe even go to\nMars, we're going to haveto be able to produce oxygen.We'll live like the pioneers,\nproduce oxygen from localresources, produce structural\nmetals, and even producephotovoltaic silicon so they can\ngenerate their own energyfrom local resources.And so electrochemistry is the\nkey enabler for that as well.So now let's turn to the whole\nunderpinning of 3.091.If we take a look at the\nperformance of any engineering", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.457}, {"text": "system it's a combination\nof the design and theconstruction.Now the construction is both the\nworkmanship and the choiceof materials.Now how do we choose\nmaterials?We choose them on the basis\nof their properties.So, for example, here's anapplication: a beverage container.This one I'm holding is made\nout of an aluminum alloy.It's a metal.When I was your age, they\nhad steel beverage cans.You can take this same beverage\nand contain it in aglass bottle.You can contain it in\na polymer bottle.Why do we make those\nvarious choices?Because they have the right\nmix of properties.Now how do you determine\nthe properties?Properties obviously are\ndetermined by the composition.We wouldn't make this thing\nout of sodium chloride.It would dissolve.So composition is important,\nbut atomic arrangement isimportant as well.Example is 1/2-inch-thick\npine board compared to a1/2-inch-thick piece\nof plywood.Both pine, but the\n1/2-inch-thick pine board isone solid pine board.I can take that pine board and\nI can fracture it if I strikeit along the grain.But the 1/2-inch-thick plywood,\nI can't do thatbecause it's 1/8-inch sheet\npine cross-laminated.1/8 inch north-south, 1/8 inch\neast-west. If I try to cutthrough that board, I can't\nadvance the fracture.Same composition, different\natomic arrangement.So the thesis of 3.091 is that\nthe electronic structure ofthe elements holds the key\nto understanding thatrelationship between\ncomposition, atomicarrangement, and properties.And once you have properties\nthat's howyou make your selection.And away we go.And that's how we got the\nsyllabus of 3.091.So the syllabus has\ntwo major blocks.The first block is general\nprinciples of chemistry-- it's", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.135}, {"text": "going to be about the\nfirst five

circle aroundit, and zinc has a \"Z\" with\na circle around it.And the Swedish chemist\nBerzelius said, you know Idon't think the French are going\nto like to use \"I\" witha circle around it for iron,\nor Germans aren'tgoing to like that.We better choose something\na little bit neutral.So they chose Latin.And that's why iron is \"Fe\" for\nferrum, and gold is \"Au\"for arum, and so on.But this was the\nfirst attempt.John Dalton actually\nwas a polymath.He was also working on vision,\nhuman vision, and he sufferedfrom an affliction that is\npresent in about 10% of men,which is red-green\ncolor blindness.And he did the original work on\nred-green color blindness.In fact, in some circles it\nis known as Daltonism.It's the same man,\nJohn Dalton.Other classifications.Dobereiner in Jena talked\nabout triads.And if you took the atomic mass\nof chlorine, added it tothe atomic massive of iodine\ndivided by two, you getsomething that's not\ntoo far off
