looks\nlike hopefully most of youwere able to get the correct\nanswer of H2 being thelimiting reactant.It looks like we're still\nfiguring out -- this room wasjust renovated, we're still\nworking out exactly how theelectronics work.So, normally we'll see a\npercentage of how many of yougot it, but I'm going to say it\nwas probably about 95% gotthe answer right.So, good job there.If you didn't get the answer\nright -- we'll send thesequestions to your TA, so any\ntime you get a clickerquestion wrong and you're\nconfused, bring it up in thenext recitation section\nand you'll be ableto discuss it there.So, starting in, we can switch\nover to the to the notes now.When we left off on Wednesday,\nwhat we had really been doingis trying to give you an\noverview of all of thedifferent topics

betweenmolecules reacting or even\nwhen we're talking aboutindividual molecules -- the\nbonds that form betweenindividual atoms -- before any\nof that we actually need toestablish a way that we're going\nto describe and thinkabout how an individual\natom behaves.And the way that we'll do this\nis starting with talking aboutthe discovery of the electron\nand the nucleus here.Once we go through that, we\nwill be able to talk aboutdescribing an atom using\nclassical physics.So, once we have an atom and a\nnucleus, what we'll try to dois apply the classical\nmechanics toexplain how that behaves.What we'll find is that this\nfails, and once this failswe're going to need\nanother option.Luckily for us, we have quantum\nmechanics, which we'llbe talking about for the\nnext few lectures, andwe'll dive into that.We might get a chance to\nintroduce it today, butcertainly in next class we'll\nbe introducing this new kindof mechanics that's going\nto allow to describethe behavior of atoms.So, I want to point out that it\nmakes a lot of sense for usto start with the discovery of\nthe electron and the nucleus,because it really highlights\none of the big issues thatcomes up in all chemistry\nresearch that you do, and thatis how do we actually study,\nor in this case, how do wediscover atoms or sub-particles\nthat we actuallycan't see at all.And there are lots of solutions\nthat

where we where at the start\nof the 20th Century inthe late 1890's is that we were\nat a place where therewas great confidence in our\nunderstanding of the universe,and our understanding of\nhow all matter worked.So, people in the chemistry\ncommunity and in the physicscommunity had this general\nfeeling that the theoreticalstructure of the entire universe\nwas pretty wellunderstood.And they had this feeling\nbecause there had just beenthis huge boon of discovery,\nof scientific advances thatincluded Newtonian mechanics,\nit included Dalton's atomictheory of matter, also\nthermodynamics and classicalelectromagnetism.So, you can understand they\nreally felt quite confident atthis time that we could explain\neverything that wasgoing on, and in fact, a really\ntelling quote from thetime was said by a professor at\nthe University of Chicago,and what he said is, \"Our future\ndiscoveries must belooked for in the sixth\ndecimal place.\"So, basically what he's saying\nhere is we pretty muchunderstand what's going on,\nthere's nothing new to reallydiscover, all we need to do is\nmeasure things more precisely.So, that's not exactly the case,\nand we're going to startin at the point where right\naround this time of greatconfidence of feeling all has\nbeen conquered, there are someobservations and discoveries\nthat are made that completelybreak down these theories.For example, in terms of the\natomic theory of matter, atthe time at the turn of the\nCentury, the understanding wasthat atoms were the most basic\nconstituent of matter, meaningyou couldn't break atoms up into\nanything smaller -- thatwas it, you're done.And with using Newtonian\nmechanics, it was assumedsince this type of mechanics\nworked so well to describeeverything we could see, it\ncould even

an\nelectron here, but how atomsbehaved, and it turns out this\nis not the case, and the firststep in discovering this is not\nthe case, was accomplishedby J.J. Thomson, and J.J.\nThomson is credited fordiscovering the electron.He was a physicist in England,\nand what his laboratory wasstudying is something called\ncathode rays, and cathode raysare simply rays that are emitted\nwhen you have a highvoltage difference between\ntwo electrodes.So, if you look at this set up,\nwhat he did when he wasstudying these rays is he had\nan evacuated tube, which isschematically shown here, where\nit's evacuated of allit's air and filled instead just\nwith hydrogen gas, and hehad this high voltage difference\nbetween an anodeand a cathode, and he actually\nput a little hole in the anodehere, so these cathode rays that\nwere produced could shootout of the cathode and actually\ncould be detected asthis luminescent spot on\na detector screen.So, lots of people were studying\ncathode rays at thetime -- one reason is they\nactually gave off this brightglow -- if you put them in an\nevacuated glass tube, you gotthese crazy patterns\nand glowing colors.So, for that reason\nit was a very hotissue in terms of research.But also, no one really knew\nwhat these were and Thomsonwas seeking to figure out some\nmore properties of them, andhe had the theory that maybe\nthey were actually chargedparticles of some sort, and\nothers had proposed this inthe past, but they didn't really\nhave an experimentalset up to test it.And that's what Thomson did.And what we did was he put two\ndetection plates on eitherside of these cathode rays,\nand when he put a voltagedifference between these two\nplates, he wanted to see if hecould actually bend the rays and\ntest if they're actually", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.193}, {"text": "charged or not.So, when the voltage difference\nbetween the platesis zero, or when we just don't\nhave the plates there at all,the cathode rays are not bent,\nthey just go right in astraight line, and they can be\ndetected on this screen.When he actually cranked up the\nvoltage between these twoplates, what he saw was really\namazing to him, which is thathe actually was able to bend\nthese rays -- this had neverbeen observed before in any\ncapacity, and he was able todetect on his screen that there\nwas this deflection, andhe could even measure\nthe degree of thedeflection that he had.So, we know now that we have\ncharged particles.Are these negatively or\npositively charged, based onthis evidence?STUDENT: Negatively.PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.So, what we have here, cathode\nrays we now know arenegatively charged particles.And, in fact, he named these\nnegatively charged particles.Does anyone know what\nhe named them?No, not electrons --\nvery good guess.He named them corpuscles.Has anyone heard\nof corpuscles?A little bit.Yeah, so it was later named that\nthese particles were, infact, electrons, and that's\nwhat they are.J.J. Thomson continued to call\nthem corpuscles for many,many, many years after everyone\nelse called themelectrons, but I'm sure no one\nminded because he did, infact, discover them.And he was actually able to find\nout more than just thatthese were charged.From classical electromagnetism,\nhe couldactually relate the degree of\ndeflection that he saw to thecharge and the mass\nof the particles.So, using that he could say that\ndelta x, and we'll putsub-negative, because we know\nnow that these are negativeparticles, is proportional to\nthe charge on that particleover m, which is the mass.So, we have e being equal to\nthe charge of the negativeparticles, and m, of course,\nis equal to the", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "mass of those particles.So, Thomson didn't stop here,\nhe actually continuedexperimenting with different\nvoltages.And what he found was if he\nreally, really ramped thevoltage up between those two\nplates, he could actuallydetect something else.And what he could detect here is\nthat there was this littlespot of luminescence that he\ncould see on the screen thatwas barely deflected at all --\ncertainly in comparison to howstrongly this first particle\nwas deflected.The second particle was\ndeflected almost not at all.But what he could tell from\nthe fact that there was asecond particle at all, and the\nfact that it was in thisdirection, is that in addition\nto his negative particle, healso, of course, had a positive\nparticle that waswithin this stream of rays\nthat were coming out.So, of course, he can use the\nsame relationship for thepositive particle, so delta\nx now of the positive isproportional to the charge on\nthe positive particle all overthe mass of the positive\nparticle.So, this is interesting\nfor several reasons.What did he manage to pull out\ninformation-wise from usingthese two relationships?And actually to do this, he made\na few more observations.The first, which I just stated,\nis that the deflectionof that negative particle was\njust far and away moreextreme, much, much larger\nthan that ofthe positive particle.The other assumption that he\nmade here is that the chargeon the two particles\nwas equal.So, how could he know that\nthe charge on the twoparticles was equal?And actually he couldn't exactly\nknow it -- it was avery good assumption that he\nmade, and he could make

was\npopping out from the hydrogen,then what he must be left with\nis h-plus, and since hydrogenitself is neutral, the h-plus\nand the electron had to add upto be a neutral charge.So, that means the charges of\nthe two pieces, the positiveand negative particle,\nmust be equal interms of absolute charge.So, using this relationship, he\ncould then actually figureout by knowing, which he knows\nhow much each of them weredeflected, he could now try to\nthink about whether or not hecould make some relationship\nbetween the masses -- betweenthe mass of the positive and\nthe negative particle.So, this relationship he was\nlooking at was starting withthe deflection, and the absolute\ndistance that theparticles were deflected.So, what he could set that equal\nto is he knows what x isproportional to in terms of\nthe negative particle, sothat's just the absolute value\nof the charge over the mass ofthe negative particle.He could divide all of that by\nthe absolute value of thecharge of the positive particle,\nall over the mass ofthe positive particle.And as we said, he made the\nassumption that those twocharges were equal, so\nwe can go ahead andcross those right out.So, what that told him was if\nhe knew the relationshipbetween how far they were each\ndisplaced, he could also knowsomething about therelationship of the two masses.So essentially, there was an\ninversely proportionalrelationship between how far the\nparticles were displaced,and what the mass of the two\nparticles turned out to be.So, because he, of course,\nobserved that the negative", "start": 720.0,

isactually larger or smaller?STUDENT: Smaller.PROFESSOR: Much, much smaller,\nexactly, then the mass of thepositive particle.So essentially, what he found\nhere is the relationshipbetween the mass of an electron\nand the mass of therest of the atom, the rest of\nthe hydrogen atom there, whichis an ion in this case.And, in fact, it's so much\nsmaller, it's close to 2,000times smaller, that we can\nmake the assumption thatessentially the electrons\ntake up no mass.I mean they take up a teeny\nbit, but essentially, whenwe're thinking about the set up\nof the atom, we don't haveto account for them as using\nup a lot of the mass we'rediscussing.So, Thomson came up with a\nmodel for the atom due tothis, and this is called the\nPlum Pudding model of theatom, and he was, as we said,\nEnglish, so plum pudding iskind of a British food.Has anyone here ever\nhad plum pudding?A couple of people.Okay.I've never even seen it, so\nthat's good -- you must bebetter travelled than I.So, the idea that he had here\nwas he treated the whole ofthe atom as sort of this\npositive pudding, so themajority of the atom was just\nkind of this goopy, positivestuff that you could think\nabout, and within the pudding,he had all these negative\ncharges, which were theelectrons, and they were the\nraisins or the plums that werein the pudding.So this was a revolutionary\nmodel of an atom when wethought of the fact that before\nthis experiment, theunderstanding was an atom could\nnot be divisible intosmaller parts, and now here we\nare with subatomic particles", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "with electrons, and this\nwonderful Plum Pudding model.So, for those of you that\nhaven't actually had plumpudding, which myself\nis included, I threwa picture up here.This was my first glance at plum\npudding, and I guess youcan see that this must be that\npositive part -- most of theplums are within that, and you\ncan see all these littleraisins or plums in here, that\nwould be that negative charge.So, that already was a big\nadvancement from where theunderstanding was at the time.We already moved way forward and\ncompletely revolutionizingthe understanding of an atom in\nthat there's something inan atom -- it's not the smallest\nthing there is.However, as you know, we\ndidn't stop at the plumpudding model, which is good,\nbecause it's a little goofy,so it's nice to move on from\nthat and move on we did.About 10 to 15 years later,\nanother physicist, ErnestRutherford, actually put this\nplum pudding model to test,and he did it through studies\nthat he'd been doing onradiation that was emitting\nsomethingcalled alpha particles.So, Rutherford, some of you may\nrecognize that name, is avery famous physicist who made\na lot of contributions interms of radioactivity.When he was studying these\nalpha particles, he wasactually the first person to\nidentify the differencebetween different types of\nparticles that radioactivematerials emit.And he got this particular\nmaterial that he was studying,radium bromide from his good\nfriend, Marie Curie, who,obviously, also was a leader,\nreally the leader in figuringout much of how radioactive\nmaterials work.She has two Nobel Prizes\nfor her workin radioactive materials.And something that maybe many\nof you think, which I know Ialways think when I hear about\nradioactivity studies in theearly 1900's, is oh, my gosh,\nthis sounds really dangerous,", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.203}, {"text": "right, they're using radium\nbromide, and this is prettydangerous radioactive\nmaterial.So, for those of you that don't\nknow radium is extremelyradioactive, even in the range\nof radioactivity, and one ofthe major problems with it is\nthat if it does get in yourbody, the radium is treated\nas calcium in your body.So, you can imagine what happens\nas it gets depositedinto your bones, which is not\nthe ideal situation after along day in the lab.So, this is really a pretty\ndangerous situation that'salways interesting\nto point out.He got this from Marie Curie --\nyou can imagine they usedthe postal service, I'm not sure\nhow else they would havetransferred it to each other.So, it really brings\nup some issues.The first thing I did when I\nheard that is actually look upto see how, in fact, Ernest\nRutherford did die in 1937,and you'll be happy to know,\nit actually wasn't fromradiation poisoning or from bone\ncancer, so that's reallygood that that worked out okay\nfor him, and that he did getto, sort of safely, at least\nend his life before theradiation ended it.But it's really interesting\nthe studies that he did dowith radium bromide, and he wasstudying the alpha particles.And what was known about alpha\nparticles at the time is thatthey were these charged\nparticles and that they werevery heavy.Does anyone know more than what\nRutherford knew at thetime, what alpha particles\nactually are?Yeah, good.So, they're actually helium\natoms, helium ions.And this wasn't really important\nfor the studies, itdidn't matter that didn't know\nwhat they are, but it's niceto kind of know now -- that we\ndo know what they were using.And he was doing quite a\nfew studies with them.One experiment that he was doing\nis detecting the numberof particles that were being\nemitted by this radium bromideas a rate, so he would measure\nthe number of particles perminute that the radium\nbromide was emitting.And what he used was a detector\nhere, so he here", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.26}, {"text": "could detect how many\nparticles werehitting this detector.He had actually developed this\ndetector with a postdoc by thename of Hans Geiger.Does that name ring a bell?STUDENT: Geiger counter.PROFESSOR: Um-hmm,\na Geiger counter.So, this, in fact, is my very\nschematic representation of aGeiger counter.For those of you don't know what\nthat is, it's simply aninstrument that counts\nradioactive particles in theair, and now that you're at MIT,\nyou'll all have a chanceto see one first hand, if you're\never in any of thelabs, especially in the\nchemistry or bio labs.As carefully as people work with\nradioactivity here, andusing often

sureeverything's safe.You'll actually see a man\nwalking around with one,sometimes in the halls, just\nkind of like this -- you hearthat click, click, click.That's a good sound, it means\nlow levels of radiation.He'll walk by your hood, so\nclick by your hood --I always get a little nervous\nwhen he walked by my hood, Idon't know why, I never worked\nwith radioactive material.But I was

first\nto discover this, isthat radioactive material,\nincluding radium bromide, havea characteristic rate that they\nemit, radioactive decay.So basically they're decaying\nat a constant rate,

specific tounderstanding the atom, and\nusing these alpha particles,these heavy-charged particles,\nwas to test if this PlumPudding model actually fit\nwhat he could observe.So, what he did was he first\nrecorded the count rate ofradium bromide before it's going\nthrough any kind of aplum pudding atom, and he found\nthat it had a count rateof 132,000 alpha particles per\nminute were being detected bythis Geiger counter.He then set up a situation where\nhe put a very, very thinpiece of gold foil right in what\nwould be in the stream ofthe alpha particles.So, it was only 10 to the\nnegative, 9 meters thick, soabout one nanometer, so that's\nreally thin, it's thinner thana strand of hair.So you can imagine, we actually\ndon't need to thinkof it as a piece of gold foil,\nit might be easier to think ofit as a couple of\nlayers of atoms.So basically he's trying to put\nsome atoms in the way ofthe alpha particle.And what he would expect is if\nthis Plum Pudding model istrue, nothing's really going\nto happen to the particles,right, they should go straight\nthrough, because if they hitan electron, those\nare so small.We figured out the mass is so\ntiny that it shouldn't reallydeflect them very much.And, of course, all that's left\nis this positive pudding.So that's not going to\ndo anything either.And what he found when he did\nthis experiment, was that thecount rate with still 132,000\ncounts per minute.So, what he could conclude thus\nfar was that this wasreally consistent with the\nPlum Pudding model.All of his heavily-charged alpha\nparticles were goingright through this thin\nlayer of gold atoms.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.329}, {"text": "So, you might think that he\nwould stop his experimentshere, and maybe he would have,\nbut as I mentioned, he didhave a postdoc working with\nhim by the name of Geiger.He also had an undergraduate, we\ncould say maybe even a UROPworking with him, and this was\nby the name of Marsden was thename of this UROP.And Rutherford realized, you\nknow I have these two peoplethat are very excited to work on\nthis project, I don't needto spend time doing it.Maybe it's not the best way for\nme to spend time lookingto see if I can find any\nbounced-back particles sinceall the particles are\naccounted for.But, you know, this\nundergraduate's very eager todo it, let's let\nhim have a try.And something you might find in\nyour UROP experience is youhave a unique advantage as an\nundergraduate, which is thatthere's not a lot of pressure\nto actually make a hugediscovery or necessarily\naccomplish a great amount.You have a little more pressure\nin grad school, butsometimes that means when\nyou're an undergrad youradvisor will decide to put you\non projects that maybe whenyou look at them seem\na little bit silly.So this project was, let's see\nif we can detect any alphaparticles by making a detector\nthat swings around.So, some people might say,\nwhy are we doing this?We know we started with a\n132,000 alpha particles.We detected a 132,000\nalpha particles.What are we even looking for?We have to build this whole new\ndetector, is this reallythe best use of my time?As an undergrad, you don't have\nto worry about it, you'rejust worried about learning.You can take these big risks of\ntime, and if at the end ofthe day there's nothing to\ndetect, you still know how tobuild a detector.So, keep that in mind if\nyou're not over-the-topexcited about the prospects\nof some of your research.You might be surprised\nat what you find out.And this is exactly what\nhappened with Marsden whodiscovered that when he shot\nthe alpha particles at thegold foil, he detected something\non his detector thatclick, click, click went\na little bit faster.So, what he detected was that\nthere were 20 alpha particles", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.432}, {"text": "per minute.Does that sound significant?It depends, right?So hopefully, the first\nexperiment he did, which Iknow that they certainly did\ndo was maybe it's justbackground noise, right?So, they took away that gold\nfoil and said is just thealpha particles hitting\nit some other way?And no, it wasn't.When he took away the gold\nfoil, the count ratewent down to zero.If he switched from gold to\nlet's say iron, he also triedplatinum, a number of different\nfoils, he found thatthey count rate, it still was 20\nalpha particles per minute.So, this is an absolutely\noutstanding discovery, eventhough, if we think about it,\nwhat is the probability thatthis happened, how often\ndid this happen?It actually almost happened\nnot at all.We can figure out exactly what\nthe probability of thisbackscattering was just by\ndividing the count rate of thenumber particle that were\nbackscattered divided by thecount rate of the incident\nparticles.So essentially, we just\nhave 20, and our 20is divided by 132,000.So, we end up with a not so\nlarge probability of 2 times10 to the negative 4.But still, we can't even\noverstate how exciting thisdiscovery was.Rutherford, the advisor here,\nhe had a lot of good thingshappen in his life,\nas I mentioned.He was the person responsible\nfor being able to first datethe age of our earth.That's a pretty nice thing.He was also married, he had a\nchild, which I hear is verynice, very exciting, also.But yet, when he saw this one\nsingle experiment from thisundergraduate, he described this\nas the most incredibleevent that had ever happened\nto him in his life.So, this was a pretty\nbig deal.We won't tell his daughter.And he gave a very good analogy\nin saying, \"It was", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.757}, {"text": "almost as incredible as if you'd\nfired a 15 inch shell ata piece of tissue paper, and\nit came back and hit you.\"And that really illustrates\nwhat's happening here, becauseif we think of the Plum\nPudding model, it'sessentially this very thin film,\nright, there's nothingthat should hit if we send alpha\nparticles through it.But what we actually\nhave is thatsomething's bouncing back.So, what happened is Rutherford\nneeded to come upwith a new model for the atom\nwith several interpretationsthat came out of these\nexperiments, and some of theseinterpretations were that, of\ncourse, we now know that thesegold atoms, they must be mostly\nempty, and the reasonthat we know that they must be\nmostly empty is because allbut 20 of these 132,000\nparticleswent all the way through.So they weren't hitting\nanything, we're dealing withmostly empty space.But he also realized that when\nthey did hit something, whatthey hit what unbelievably\nmassive, but also that thatmass was concentrated into this\nvery, very small space.So eventually, this is what we\nhave come to call the nucleusof an atom.And the nucleus name was used\nas an analogy to the nucleusof a cell, so in some ways that\nmakes it easier to seethe connection, but I think it\ncan also be a little bitconfusing for maybe 7th graders\nthat are learning bothat the same time, that this\nnucleus acts very differentfrom a nucleus in a cell,\nalthough, of course, theremany of them in the\nnucleus of a cell.There are some other things that\nRutherford was able tofigure out.One is the diameter of the\nnucleus, and that turns out tobe 10 to the negative\n14 meters.If we think about the size of\na typical cell -- excuse me,now I'm getting confused\nabout nuclei.If we think of the size of a\ntypical atom, we would saythat would be about 10 to\nthe negative 10 meters.So, we can see the diameter\nof a nucleus is absolutely", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.85}, {"text": "smaller, really concentrating\nthat mass intoa very small space.So, you might be asking\nhow did heactually figure that out?We'll do the calculation\nourselves.In fact, we'll do the whole\nexperiment ourselves, minusthe radioactivity in just a\nminute, so we'll be able toanswer that question for you.He also figured out that\nthe charge of thenucleus was a plus ze.This makes sense intuitively as\nwell, because z is just theatomic number.So, let's say we have an atomic\nnumber of 3, that meanswe have 3 electrons, so we\nbetter hope to get our neutralatom that we have a charge\nof plus 3 in the nucleus.So, I mentioned at the\nbeginning, while he wasworking with this radium\nbromide, that I was veryrelieved to see that it did\nnot kill him to do theseexperiments.However, I think I will share\nwith you that the cause of hisdeath was, in fact, related to\nhis research here, even thoughit was a little more\ntangled up.So, what happened, of course,\nafter he discovered thenucleus, not surprising, he won\na Nobel Prize for this --I would hope that he would.And in addition to winning a\nNobel Prize, he was alsoknighted, which was a nice\nbonus for someone born inEngland, that's a great thing\nto happen to them.The problem that he ran into is\nat some point a little bitlater in his life, he had a\nhernia which was a prettystandard case, but what he\nwas going to need was anoperation on it.And the glitch came that at\nleast at the time, if you werea knight, you could only be\noperated on by a doctor thatwas also

great.So, that is her daughter, Sam\nthat you see strapped to thechest, and Dr. Patti Christie\nhelping us out here.All right.So, we'll move this up to the\nfront in just a minute, butI'm going to

we're going to do the same\nthing and figure out thediameter of these styrofoam\nballs here, and we can do itby using the relationship\nof how many backscatter.So, if we think about the\nprobability of backscattering,", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.522}, {"text": "which is the exact same thing\nthat we saw Rutherfordcalculate, using the 20\ndivided by 132,000.But in our case, the probability\nof

266.Good information retention.All right.So, we have the probability\nhere.So, in terms of the number of\nballs scattered over thetotal, we can also relate the\nprobability to the area of allof those nuclei divided\nby the total area thatthe atoms take up.Right, this makes a lot of\nsense, because if the entireatom was made up of nuclei,\nthen we would have 100%probability of hitting one of\nthese nuclei and having thingsbounce back.So, here we have the area of\nthe nuclei we'll figure outadding those all together versus\nthe space of all of theatoms put together.So, not only did Professor\nSayer, who's in the ChemistryDepartment who put together this\ncontraption for all ofyou, not only did she magnify\nthe size of these gold nuclei,but she actually had to smoosh\nall of these atoms closertogether then they normally\nwould be.If, in fact, a gold nucleus was\nthis size here, we wouldneed to use another lecture hall\nin order to find a placeto put this nucleus\nright here.This is a little bit of a\ntricky experiment, so wedecided we'll just smoosh it all\nin, and we'll actually beable to account for it, because\nwe'll take intoaccount the area of all\nof those

measuring\nthat space there.So, the number of nuclei, if we\nwere to sit and count theseas well, is 119.So, we'll multiply that by just\npi, r squared, to getthat cross-section, and divide\nall of that by 1 .39 meters squared.So, what we have here is a\nrelationship that can tell uswhat the probability of\nbackscattering is, but what wewant to pull out, since we can\nexperimentally measure whatthe probability is, what we need\nto pull out is the radiusor the diameter of these\nnuclei, so we can just,instead of solving for p, we can\nswitch it around and solvefor the radius.So, that's
