hours.Just email me.Copy Dylan, who's the\nnew course administrator.There was a swap out from Ryan.Or copy Talida or\nSabrina or something.But just shoot me an\nemail, and then I'llset something up with you if\nyou want to follow up eitheron your projects, or it's\na question about anythingaround blockchain.I also want to thank-- we\ndon't usually have peoplehere with jackets on.But we have six\nor eight veteranswho have served our country, and\nI thank you for your service.[APPLAUSE]They're here to observe us.I don't know whether we'll\nscare them away or not.But thank you for joining us.So today's topics are\ngoing to be around--of course, we're going to\ngo through the readingsa little bit.We don't have Larry Lessig, and\nit's a little bit more relaxed.So I might be doing some

to do\nthat as the setup again.And, of course, because you all\nlove hash functions so much,it's just a way to\nbring it back to someof the technical features\nto set up, really,what are some of the issues.We have-- I think it's\nlecture 11 and 12,where it's just what I call\nact two as the economics.But I want to set up a little\nbit about the economics.You saw that in the reading--the 21st Geneva report\nthat Simon Johnson and NehaNarula and Mike Casey\nand Jonah and I wrote.So now you all--I only assigned his\nseven pages out of it.So I hope that you\nread the seven pages.But some of the\ncosts and trade-offs,the challenges of blockchain\ntechnology that are very real.I'll give you my own\nperspective on whereI think this will sort out\nover the next 3 to 10 years.So I'll do some predictions.Vitalik Buterin has also\ntalked about a trilemma,and I want to chat about that.And that was one of the\nreadings, if I recall.He's such a leader\nin this communitythat when he writes and\nsays something like this,it was relevant, I think,\nthat everybody's understandwhat Vitalik Buterin's\nkind of \"trilemma\" is,even though that some\npeople think he's mistaken.Some possible\nsolutions to this--we have, who's\nattending today, Madarswho is actually one of\nthe developers on someof the solutions around\nzero-knowledge proofs.And he might get called on.He works over at the\nDigital Currency Initiative.I hope you're ready.And why I think governance is\nthe most challenging piece.So with that, the readings--I have a list of everybody\nthat hasn't spoken yet.",

the\nfact that-- because they'reso small, they were just\nessentially inconsistently[INAUDIBLE].GARY GENSLER: All right.So how to do micro payments.And the small micro payments--partly

have a high\nincentive to keep [INAUDIBLE]privacy side.GARY GENSLER: So\non the one side,there's a commercial interest\nto keep things private.On the other side, the official\nsector might want to peer in.And then interestingly, on\ntop of it-- layered on it--the official sector also wants\nprivacy for everybody otherthan the official sector.So like in Europe,\nthere's a new requirementthat

technicalchallenges, why is\nit still such a--something that's\nso sought after?So I'm hoping that we can\nclear that up a little.GARY GENSLER: We'll\ngive it a shot.Other thoughts or questions\nfrom the readings?AUDIENCE: I [INAUDIBLE]\nthird year with youabout the layer 2.GARY GENSLER: About the layer 2.Yes.AUDIENCE: The layer 2.Yeah.And [INAUDIBLE]\nthat is that it'sOK about having a second

bit\ndifferent technology cord sidechains or sharding, which I\nthink was an optional-- yeah.I did that optionally.I didn't force you.So there's a number of\nalternative channels.And though the technologies\nare, to technologists,importantly different--sharding, and side chains, and\nlayer 2-- for this purpose,for a moment, let me blur\nover the differences.The question that\nLeandro asks is,well, is that meaning\nthat we have to trust?I would contend we\nalready have to trustthe protocol that the Bitcoin\ncore developers have written.It's open GitHub.It's open code.But very few people\nare actually goingto investigate it\nenough to be assuredthere's not a bug or an error.But I agree with\nyou that the core--the Bitcoin core or\nthe Ethereum corehas been living\nin-- if I could callit-- the technological\nand commercial swamp.It's been attacked by so\nmany viruses and bugs,you have some\nreason to trust it.But you should\nnever be 100% sure.The side chains are less tested.But I do agree with you.You have some trust, unless\nI misunderstand the question.I thought it was a trust\nin the underlying code.AUDIENCE: My main\npoint is workingwith secondary that's

get to the slides?Because I think you\ndo actually havesome pretty good\nvalidation, but Ithink you're right that\nit's a valid question--is the validation in these\noff chains still work?There was a question back here.AUDIENCE: I was\njust sort of goingto respond to the issue\nof sort of trustingthese offline mechanisms.It's not in the same\nvein, but 90% of--according to this--\ndaily tradingvolumes occurs in\nthese crypto exchanges.So that's also sort of\nhappening off the chain.So I think that in this\ncommunity of peoplewho are currently\nparticipating, thereis no reason that\nwe're not goingto trust third-party vendors.GARY GENSLER: So you're\nraising the point--and it's a sort of an irony\nof the whole ecosystem--that the majority-- and, in some\ncryptocurrencies, over 90%--of the actual daily\ntransactions are happeningin very centralized ways--on exchanges, particularly\nthe centralizedcrypto exchanges, where--I can't remember.But it was about half\nof you have ownedBitcoin at some point in time.But can I ask how many\nof you have actuallyoperated a full node?So there's the two technologists\nat the middle table, and Hugo,who is also, if\nI remember

you don't need--But in essence,\nthe big differenceis account-based versus\ntransaction-based.The kind of big difference is\nEther does seem to go faster,but it doesn't have\na lot of throughput.They still both\nuse proof of work.Even though Ether\nsays they're goingto move to proof of state,\nthey're not there yet.When they get there,\nwe'll all know together.The economics are a bit\ndifferent, of course, as well.But all of these details\nare part of the reasonwhy there's problems.And so you read in the\nGeneva report a little bitabout a professor--an economist from the 1930s.Does anybody want to\ntake a crack at it?Or should I just do my slides?Here we go.AUDIENCE: It was [INAUDIBLE]GARY GENSLER: Yes.AUDIENCE: He had the fact\nthat everything you should beanalyzed on the cost-benefit\nanalysis so that if one wantsto use the blockchain\ndecentralized network,you should take into account\nall the benefits in termsof various costs of trust--enhancing security,\nbut also the costof switching to a\ndecentralized system.GARY GENSLER: Coase\nis an economistfrom the 1930s who\nwrote extensivelyabout the cost and empirically\nabout the corporation.", "start": 1200.0,

decentralizationto centralization, you tend--on the centralized\nside, you get capture.You get economic\nrents, and you dohave a single point of failure.In some sense, the\nresiliency of the system,whether it's in finance, where\nyou worry about systemic risk--one clearinghouse, one\ncentral bank, one government.If it's knocked out, it's\nso relevant to the economyat large.It brings it down.Or if it's one database--you have a single point,\nin essence, of failure.Economic rents is an ability\nto collect excess profits.I assure you everybody\nin this classwants to collect economic

side,\nthere's the benefits.The y-scale is not\nwritten on here.The y-scale is how however\nyou want to think of it,but I think of it\nas kind of costs.So the y-scale-- up the\ny-scale is greater costs.Decentralization--\nthe big costs thatcome there is coordination.You have a lot of\ncollective action issues.If the 100 or so\npeople in this roomwere trying to do\nsomething together,you would have to figure out\nhow to do it collectivelyin coordination.And that's true of\nevery blockchainthat you can think about.Governance relates\nto coordinationand collective action issues.And then

more centralization.In theory, if I\nchange the slope,it would be further to\nthe decentralized side.Right?If the cost of decentralization\nis a lower slope,and the cost of\ncentralization is higher,we will tend more\ntowards decentralization.So it's just a\nway to visualize--here are the costs\nof centralization,which are basically capture\nrents and single pointof failure, not\nthat

Bitcoin Core code.It's actually under\na copyright licensehere at MIT, which\nmakes it free.That was Satoshi\nNakamoto's decision.It wasn't that-- well, maybe\nNakamoto does work here.[LAUGHTER]It's a

person,so I've never checked for\nbugs or anything like that.I don't know how to do that.I kind of just take the\nsoftware as it standsand download it and install it.And when they say\nI need to updatemy software because\nthere's a bug,I'll update the software\nbecause there's a bug.And that kind of feels like\nmore of a centralized system,but you're getting\nthat security.But then the decentralization\ncomes from the factthat the network is still\nspread out over so many nodes.So there are trade\noffs that I thinkyou can kind of build on one\nand then climb another cliffand kind of build on each,\nbut not the same time.GARY GENSLER: So Hugo is\nsomewhere in the middle.I'm probably an optimist\nenough on the human conditionand that the technologists\nwill solve more than

the cutting edgehere at MIT of some\nof the folks tryto figure out how to do privacy\nand security at the same time.Questions on that?Because we're going to\nget to the tougher things.Interoperability.Linking Blockchain applications\nto legacy databasesor linking them to each other.So you might want to link\nBlockchain application--if you're thinking about\na payments protocol,how does that payments\nprotocol and Blockchain worldlink to the fiat.Because ultimately, if you're\ndoing, let's say, remittances,and you want to move\nmoney from here to Mexico,somebody wants\nMexican peso, theymight be starting\nin US dollars, howdo you operate basically\nwith three different systemsin that case?Your ingenious,\ninnovative start-up,but the US dollar fiats system\nand the Mexican peso system.So that's a form\nof interoperabilityand the challenge around it,\nor Blockchain to Blockchainif we've got 1,600\nof them, or eveninteroperability\nof the main chainand some of these layer\ntwo and side chains.That's an easier\ninteroperabilitybecause it's kind\nof coded right in.But it's always-- and\nthis is not a new thing.Banking has

of\ntrust in coordinatingthe transfer assets\nand informationacross chains, in essence, or as\nwe talk about, across ledgers.So it's an issue that\nit's been around.We just got to sort of\nsee how we solve it here.One solution.It doesn't mean it's\nthe right solution,it's the only solution,\nbut one solutionis to do through some\ndecentralized mechanismsincluding side chains, or one\nof the favorites of the directorof the Media Lab,\nJoey Ito, thanks maybeif we have layer 2, we\nshould also have layer 0.Underneath all of these\ncoins, underneath Ethereumand Bitcoin, maybe\nthere's a layerthat we can\ntechnologically create.Nobody's done this yet,\nbut Joey's a visionary.Joey had the first\ninternet service providerin Japan at the\nage of 23 when hegot $1,500 of computer equipment\nand put it in his bathroom.And that's how he started.Yes.Yes, his bathroom.It was the only\nreal estate he had.So which way does this go?You hadn't heard\nthat about Joey?So it's a way to\nstart a company.And I think far more\nwork needs to be done.So it may be solvable.I'm not sure.And then consensus required\nfor software updates.It's a tough one.Open source software

blocks,I'm simplifying again--think of like Excel and you get\nthat update on Excel or Wordfor Windows, and you\ncan't open your old files.I mean, it's a\nrough lay definitionof what this issue is.And so it leads to\nsomething called hard forks.And this little visual\non the right hand sideis basically what happens\nis you can't validateall the old blocks,\nbecause the new softwareis kind of going beyond it.A hard fork would happen is if\nyou took two megabyte blocks,if you made the\nblock size bigger.The old software would not take\nthat if I've got this right.That would be a hard fork.And so that's an issue,\nand it's happened.The Ethereum network\nhas Ethereum Classicand has Ethereum\nbecause of a hard forkthat was encouraged\nby Vitalik Buterin,and the Bitcoin network\nhas one from last year,where it was this debate\nabout block sizes.So most software for\ndecades has dealtwith how do we update software,\nbut they can push it to us.And we get it, and we hit\na button and we get it,and after a while,\nwe get annoyedand we don't update\nif you're like me.But the consensus-- remember,\nthis was a graph that we had.The consensus always\nsupports the longest chain.If the

a\nsimilar direction?Blockchain applications\nderive part of their valuefrom participation of multiple\nparties on the networkas well, that multiple\npeople are involved.It's remarkable in hindsight\nthat Satoshi Nakamoto, whomeverhe or she was, got\nthis many people.There's nearly 100 people in\nthis room studying this 10years later.But somehow he solved a\ncollective action issuebecause it was just\nsoftware code back in 2009.But it's still the example, how\ndoes Silvio Micali with a veryclever Blockchain adaptation\nand Algorand, how does heget people to start using it?And until he starts to\nget people to use it,where's the value?Or if you have an application\nthat's to be file sharingor for medical records, there is\na medical records project hereat MIT, but how do you start\nto get people to use it?And these are solved every\nday in the internet space,but Blockchain has a\nlittle bit greater wrinkle.So there's a chicken\nand egg issue.Priya.AUDIENCE:

in other blockchains,are basically pouring\nmoney into the ecosystem,giving money to developers\nto develop solutions,because they are betting on\nthe success of that network.GARY GENSLER: Right.But for every one\nof you as you'rethinking about your\nfinal projects,this collective action\nissue has multiple features.One, to me, is the governance\nof the Blockchain softwareupdates, which we said is a\nlittle bit about hard forksand so forth and how\ndo you have consensusand how centralized to the\ngovernance stay, which we'llcome back to when we talk about\nthe Securities and ExchangeCommission and whether\nit's a token that'sregulated as a security.So there's that\npart of governance.But then there's the\ncollective action issuethat if you have a payments\nor medical records or tradefinance, how do you\nget folks to adopt.And in the banking\nsector, the banksare the big sort of\nelephants in the room,the big dominant incumbents,\nhow do you get them to adopt,or are you somehow\ncompeting away their profitsand not having them adopt, which\nis more a commercial businessissue about collective action.So the financial sector,\nas we've talked about,favors
