Now,\ntechnically, a model is goingto be a description of any\nrelationship between two ormore economic variables.OK?That's a model.A description of any\nrelationship between two ormore economic variables.The trick with economics, and\nthe reason many of you will befrustrated during the semester,\nis that unlike themodern relationship between\nsay energy and mass thesemodels are never precise.They are never accurate\nto the 10th decimal.OK?This is not a precise,\nscientificrelationship with modeling.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.575}, {"text": "We'll be making a number of\nsimplifying assumptions thatallow us to capture the main\ntendencies in the data.That allow us to capture the\nmain insights into howindividuals make consumption\ndecisions and how firms makeproduction decisions.But it's not going to be as\nclean and precise as the kindof proofs you're going to be\ndoing in some of your otherclasses in freshman and\nsophomore year.OK?So basically, we have a trade\noff with the simplifyingassumptions.On the one hand, obviously we\nwant a model that can explainreality as much as possible.If a model can't explain\nreality, it's not useful.On the other hand, we need a\nmodel that's tractable, amodel that I can teach you\nin a lecture or less.OK?And basically, what we do is we\nmake a lot of simplifyingassumptions in this class to\nmake those models work.And yet, what we'll find is\ndespite these assumptions,we'll come up with incredibly\npowerful predictions of howconsumers and producers\nbehave.So with consumers what we're\ngoing to do is, we're going tosay that consumers are\nconstrained by their limitedwealth or what we'll call\ntheir budget constraint.And subject to that constraint\nthey choose the set of goodsthat makes them as well\noff as possible.OK?That's what we're going to call\nutility maximization.We'll say the consumers maximize\ntheir utility,consumers are going to maximize\nutility subject to abudget constraint.That's going to be what\nwe're going to developthe consumer decision.They have some utility function\nwhich is going to bea model of their preferences.OK?So I'm going to propose to take\neverything you love inlife and write it down\nas a u function.OK?Then I'm going to propose you\ntake all the resources at yourdisposal, write them down as a\nbudget constraint and then Ijust do constrained maximization\nto solve for howyou make decisions.Firms, on the other hand, are\ngoing to maximize profits.Pi is profits.Firms are going to\nmaximize profits.Their goal is to make as much\nprofit as possible, to earn as", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.58}, {"text": "much money as possible.OK?However, that's going to be\nsubject to both the demands ofconsumers, we get to firms it's\na lot harder, subject toboth consumer demand\nand input costs.So firms have to consider,\nconsumers have to considerlook what does stuff cost\nand what do I like,I'll make my decision.Firms is a little more\ncomplicated.They've go to consider, what do\nconsumers want and how do Imake what they want?So they've got to consider both\nthe output side, what aconsumer is going to want me to\nmake and what's it going tocost me to produce that good?And how do I combine those\nto make the most profits?OK?So from these assumptions, we\nwill be able to answer thethree fundamental questions\nof microeconomics.OK?The three fundamental questions\nof microeconomicswill be, what goods and services\nshould be produced?What goods and services\nshould be produced?How to produce those\ngoods and services?And who gets the goods\nand services?What goods and services\nget produced?How to produce those\ngoods and services?And who gets them?And what's amazing, we'll learn\nin this course, is thatall three of these questions,\nthe three fundamentalquestions that drive our entire\neconomy, are all solvedthrough the role of\none key statevariable, which is prices.Prices in the economy resolve\nall of these problems.

startwith one casual example.OK?Let's think about the\ndevelopment of the iPod.OK?Let's cast our minds way back,\nlo way back to the developmentof the iPod.OK?Now, when Apple was thinking\nabout making the iPod, theyhad to ask, would consumers\nwant this?So consumers had to decide given\ntheir limited resources,given the fact that they were\nbuying a certain set of thingswould they be willing to forsake\nsome things they werealready doing to spend the\nmoney on the iPod?OK?It was a non-trivial\namount of money.Would they be willing to\nforsake things they arealready doing?OK?To spend money on the iPod.And clearly they were.Clearly, consumers were willing\nto spend money, tospend a lot of money,\nto get an iPod.They were originally\nwhat? $300 Backwhen $300 meant something.OK.So basically, what the firm will\ndo is they'll say, OK, weget a signal from the consumer\nthat they're willing to paymoney to get the iPod.They're willing to pay a high\nprice to get the iPod.Now, the firm will say, well,\nshould we make iPods?Well, that will depend on what\nit cost to make them.So we have to then assess what\nare the inputs that we'll needto make an iPod?Well, to do that we have to\nlook at the prices of thevarious inputs that we'll need,\nof the chip in them andthe metal and all the other\nstuff that goes into the iPod.OK?So they can shop across\ndifferent countries, todifferent kinds of chips, they\ncan look at different kinds ofmonitors, et cetera.But, once again, what they'll\ndo is they'll use the pricesof those different inputs\nto decide how", "start":

have to pay for the chip\nand the casing and all theother things that go\ninto the iPod.OK?And then finally, who's\ngoing to get the iPod?Well, they're going to make\na certain amount.What decided who gets them?Well, the person who gets them\nare the people who are willingto pay the price that Apple\ndecides to charge.Some people are willing to pay\nthat price, they're going toget an iPod.Some people are not willing to\npay that price, they will notget an iPod.So the price in the market will\nultimately decide whogets the iPod, as well.OK?So basically, prices will\ndetermine what gets produced,how it's produced,\nand who gets thegoods that are produced.OK?Of course, this is a very, very\nsimplified example, asyou can already tell.There are lots of cases\nwhere prices don'tdecide these things.So my favorite example is the\nfact that there are lines forhours to get tickets to see\na Lady Gaga concert.OK?Now if it's really true that\nprices determine everything,we shouldn't see any lines.It should just be that those\nwho are willing to pay themost to see Lady Gaga should.Those who want the most\nto get Lady Gagashould get the tickets.Those who aren't willing to pay\nshouldn't get the tickets.Why should there be a line?Not to mention the fact that\npeople shouldn't be willing topay anything, but that's\na different issue.That's a taste issue.We'll come to taste later.OK?So basically, clearly this\nis not working perfectly.If the world worked in the way\nI just described, then whatshould happen is there should be\nessentially an auction andwhoever is willing to pay the\nmost for Lady Gaga ticketswould get them.And whoever is not willing\nto pay wouldn't.It wouldn't involve\nany waiting inline or other things.Now, what's very interesting\nis we've

or\nTicketmaster or these othersecondary sellers and there\nthere are prices thatdetermine it.So how many people have\nwaited on line toget a concert ticket?That's amazing.So if I asked this question 30\nyears ago, 90% of the handswould have gone up.OK?So what that means is the\nprice mechanism hasstarted to be used.It has replaced the line\nmechanism as a way to allocatethose tickets.And we see prices working.That wasn't true.There wasn't StubHub.There weren't these secondary\nticket sellers 30 years ago.You had to wait on line\nto get the tickets.Now, so that's basically, sort\nof, an overview about, sort ofan example, of how we think\nabout the role of prices.Now, let me draw a couple of\nimportant distinctions, termsI'm going to use this semester\nthat I want you to becomfortable with.OK?The first distinction I want to\ndraw is between theoreticalversus empirical economics.Theoretical versus empirical\neconomics.OK.Theoretical economics is the\nprocess of building models toexplain the world.OK?Empirical economics is the\nprocess of testing thosemodels to see how good\na job they do inexplaining the world.OK?We could all make up a model.OK?Anybody with math

of\ntheoretical economics isessentially to build a model\nthat has some testablepredictions.To build a model that says,\nlook here's my simplifiedmodel of how consumers decide\nwhether or not to buy an iPod.OK?I have a model of that, that\nI've built theoretically.Well, that has some testable\npredictions.And the role of empirical\neconomics is to gather thedata and go and test them using\nstatistical methods.Specifically, typically\nregression analysis like thekind you learn about in\nadvanced statistics.OK?So basically, what we're going\nto do is we're going to is 95%of this course will be\nabout theoreticaleconomics this semester.It will be about understanding\nhow economists develop themodels to model how consumers\nand firms behave. But I willtry to talk somewhat about\nempirical economics and whatdata we can bring to bear to\nunderstand whether or notthese models explain\nthe world.OK?The other distinction that's\nvery important is positiveversus normative economics.Positive versus normative\neconomics.And this is the distinction\nbetween the way things are,which is positive economics, and\nthe way things should bewhich is normative economics.Distinction between the way\nthings are and the waythings should be.OK?So let's consider a great\nexample of microeconomics atwork which is auctions\non eBay.OK?Auctions on eBay, economists\nlove studying auctions on eBaybecause it's a textbook example\nof what we call aperfectly competitive market\nwhich is what we'll focus onthe semester.A perfectly competitive\nmarket.OK?And by that we mean that\nbasically that producers in", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.393}, {"text": "this market offer up\ntheir good to awide range of consumers.OK?A number of producers offer\nup their goods to awide range of consumers.OK?And the consumers bid up the\nprice until the person who hasthe highest value for\nthe good gets it.So price serves exactly\nthe signal it shouldin allocating goods.OK?So really eBay's really sort of\nabout this third thing ofwho gets the good.OK?I offer my alarm clock or\nwhatever on eBay, OK, and thenpeople bid on that.And whoever values that the\nmost, that rare Jon Gruberalarm clock the most,\nthey get it.OK?So it's a perfect textbook\nexample.OK?And basically, because on eBay\nthe price is used, or now withalso StubHub and concert\ntickets, the price is used toallocate the good to the\nperson who wantsit the most. OK?Now, a recent example of an\nauction on eBay that a lot ofattention, not so recent anymore\na couple years ago,someone tried to auction\ntheir kidney on eBay.OK?Someone offered their kidney for\nauction on eBay and said,I have two kidneys\nI only need one.So I'm going to auction my\nkidney, you pay for me to flyto wherever you need my kidney\nand the operation, they takeit out and they give\nit to you.And that's the way it goes.So what happened was person\noffered their kidney and theysaid the starting price\nwill be $25,000.They didn't do a buy it now.They said the starting price\nwill be $25,000 and thebidding went on.The price got to $5 million\nbefore eBay shot it down.eBay shut the auction down.And eBay said no, in fact,\nyou can't do this.Now there's two questions\nhere.The first is, why did\nthe price of thekidney go so high?That's the positive question.The positive question is, why\ndid the price the kidney oneBay get so high?", "start": 960.0,

you'll talk more rigorouslyabout these on Friday.Basically, they're what\nthey sound like.Demand is how much someone\nwants something.Supply is how much of\nit there is to have.And the intuition here\nis surprising.OK?The more that there's demand for\na good, the higher will bethe upward pressure on prices.The more people want a good,\nthe higher prices will go.And the less supply there is\nof a good, also the higherprices will go.So if everybody wants something\nbut it's common, theprice will be low.And if no one wants something\nbut it's uncommon, the pricewill still be low,\nand vice versa.In fact, the development of the\nmodel of supply and demandframework was from Adam Smith,\nthe, sort of, so-called firsteconomist who wrote The Wealth\nof Nations in 1776 which is,sort of, viewed as the,\nkind of, firstserious book about economics.And he posed what he called\nthe water diamond paradox.What Smith said in that book is,\nlook, it's clear water isthe most important\nthing in life.We can't live without water.And diamonds are completely\nirrelevant to life.You can live totally fine\nwithout a diamond.And yet, the price\nof diamonds isastronomical and water's free.How can this be?How can it be that water which\nis so much more of afundamental building block of\nour life is so much cheaperthan diamonds which are not.And the answer, of course, is\nthat so far you've onlyconsidered demand\nand not supply.Yes, it's true.The demand for water\nis much higher thanthe demand for diamonds.But the supply is even larger.So that basically, yes it's true\nthat while water shouldbe worth more, in fact, in the\nend the price of water is muchlower, because of the twin\nforces of demand and supply.The demand is higher, but the\nsupply is much higher.", "start": 1080.0,

demand for\na kidney is going to be thefact that you die without it.OK?If you have no kidneys, you're\nhaving kidney failure.OK?You'll die without it.So basically, what will\ndetermine it is people arewilling to spend all their\nwealth, as much money as theycan have, to get a kidney OK?So the demand will\nbe quite high.The supply will be quite low.Sadly, not many people are\nwilling to be organ

auction your\nbody parts on eBay.OK?Should they have done that?That's the normative question.That's economics gets really\ninteresting, which is you allare smart enough to figure out\nwhy the price went up.But this is where it gets\ninteresting is should peoplehave been able to auction\ntheir kidney on eBay?On the one hand, many, many\npeople in this country die forwant of a body part.OK?Thousands to hundreds of\nthousands of people die everyyear waiting for a transplant.OK?If someone is incredibly rich\nand they want a body part,which to me a surplus because\nI have two

one less kidney\nthat can go tothe transplant center.And that means the rich guy gets\nthe kidney, and someoneelse implicitly doesn't.That's a trade-off.You've just described\na trade-off.The trade-off is that basically\nnow we've allocatedthe kidney away from the poor\nperson to the rich person.Now, but why do we\ncare about that?I mean one person dies,\nanother personlives, why do we

OK.The more money you have, the\nmore you're willing, or morerelevant perhaps your parents\nhave, the more willing you areto go ahead and buy\nthat new edition.The less money you have, the\nless willing you are.OK?So basically, it's going to\ndepend on whether you'repaying or your parents are\npaying, in which case what thehell you might as well buy\nthe fifth edition.OK?And then finally, you're going\nto take these preferences andthis constraint, your\npreferences and yourresources, and go to the market\nand look at what doesthe market tell me the\ndifference is.So you're going to say, here's\nhow much I kind of care aboutfifth versus fourth edition,\nhere's the resources I have,now I'll go to the market and\nsay, aha there is a $45difference between these\ntwo editions.So now I will solve\nthat constrainedoptimization problem.And I'll decide whether I\nwant to get that book.You are going to be thinking to\nyourself, this is stupid.I never think about\nit that way.But the key point is you don't\nhave to think about itexactly that way.There's a famous example in\neconomics of what's called the", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "as if principle.I don't know if kids still\nsay this one, as if.So it's the as if principle.OK?And basically it's from Milton\nFriedman, the famous economistfrom Chicago, who said, look,\nwhen you're playing pool,technically you could compute\nthe optimal angles of which toshoot the ball every single time\nto get the appropriatebounce and get the balls in.You could do the mathematics\nand compute it.But professional pool players\nare not in this class withyou, I'll only say that.OK?They're not guys who are able\nto do that computation.They just know how to hit the\nball to get the same outcomethey would get if they\nmathematically solved for theoptimal trajectory\nto hit the ball.OK?They behave as if they've\nsolved the constrainedoptimization problem.And your decision when you buy\nthis book, you may not thinkit through the very framework\nthat I just laid out veryheuristically and will lay out\nmore rigorously this semester.But you're going to behave\nas if you do.Because those facts are going to\nbe in your mind, and you'llbe thinking about it when\nyou make that decision.So while you may feel the models\nwe learn in this courseare rather abstract and don't\nreally explain how you behavein an everyday basis, you're\ngoing to behave as if thosemodels are really\napplying to you.And if you think about, over the\nnext few days, think aboutthe decisions you make.From should I bring\nan umbrella today,it looks like rain?Well, on the one hand,\nI might lose it.It's a pain to carry.On the other hand, how much do\nI care about getting wet?That's a constrained\noptimization decision.To should I have an extra drink\nat a party Friday night?On the one hand, that could\nhave some pros and cons.OK?These are all decisions,\nconstrained optimizationdecisions, you're\ngoing to make.They're going to affect\nyour life.And what we'll learn this\nsemester is about how you makethem and how we model, how\neconomists can use what welearn about that to understand\nthe function of the economy.OK?So I'm going to stop there.One other announcement, there\nwill, in general, be handoutsevery lecture.I'm not going to\ndo PowerPoint.I'm going to do handouts.So when you come in every\nlecture, please look at theback banister.Though typically, not today.But typically, they'll be\nhandouts that you'll need tofollow along with in class.", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.85}, {"text": "So remember, go to section on\nFriday, first problems thatwill be posted on Friday and it\nwill be due in section theFriday after.And I'll see you all back here\non Monday, next Monday.", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.602}]
