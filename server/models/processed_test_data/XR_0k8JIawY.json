The pH of theother solution hasn't changed.\nLet's reset.

The pH of theother solution hasn't changed.\nOK, let's look at our pairs of solutions.When we added a strong acid or base to solution\nA, its pH changed dramatically after onlyone drop! When we added one drop of acid or\nbase to solution B, its pH stayed the same.Let's add more acid and more base to solution\nB and see what happens.It takes much more acid or base to change\nthe pH of this solution by the same amount!How is this solution able to resist changes\nto its pH when strong acids and bases areadded? How could we make and use such a solution?\nIn this video, you'll find out.This video is part of the Structure-Function-Properties\nvideo series. The structure, function, andproperties of a system are related and depend\non the processes that define or create thesystem.Hi, my name is George Zaidan and I am [attribution]\nBefore watching this video, you should knowwhat an acid is, what a base is, be familiar\nwith the concept of chemical equilibria, understandwhat distinguishes strong acids or bases from\nweak ones, and be able to define pH, Ka and", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.31}, {"text": "pKa.After watching this video, you will be able\nto:Describe how the structure, or composition,\nof a buffer functions to resist changes inpH\nExplain how the choices made in buffer designimpact the properties of a buffer.In chemistry, solutions that resist changes\nto their pH when acids or bases are addedare called \"buffers.\" Solution B in our demo\nwas a buffer solution. Let's develop a molecular-levelmodel of solution B to try and figure out\nhow buffers work. First, let's review ourexperimental data and list the observations\nour model must satisfy:The starting pH was around 6\nWhen we added one drop of strong base (enoughto change the pH of our control solution),\nthe pH of our buffer solution did not changeWhen we added one drop of strong acid (enough\nto change the pH of our control solution),the pH of our buffer solution did not change\nEventually, after addition of much more strongacid or strong base, the pH of our buffer\nsolution did changeBased on observations 1, 2, and 4, you might\nthink that our buffer solution is simply anacid in solution. But it's not. Relying on\nobservation 3, explain why a solution comprisedsolely of an acid in water could not effectively\nresist changes to its pH when more acid isadded. Pause the video.\nYour initial reaction to this question isprobably that the pH of such a solution would\nalways decrease when more acid is added, andtherefore observation 3 could not be satisfied.\nThis is correct, except for two cases: first,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.372}, {"text": "the added acid could be exactly the same strength\nand concentration as the acid already present.In that case, the pH wouldn't change at all,\nand we might think we were dealing with abuffer solution. Second, the added acid could\nbe much weaker or much less concentrated thanthe acid already present. Think about it like\nthis: a 1 liter of a 1 molar solution of hydrochloricacid can hold its pH if a few milliliters\nof 0.1 molar acid or base is added. In thatcase, the pH might only change a little, and\nwe might also think we were dealing with abuffered solution. But in both of these cases,\neven though it seems as though the solutionis buffered, that \"buffer-like\" response depends\non the relative strengths and concentrationsof each acid, not on any intrinsic property\nof the solution.So if our buffer isn't just an acid, what\nis it? Let's review the observations. Observations2 and 3, taken together, suggest that there\nare both acidic and basic species presentin our solution, since additional acid or\nbase must be neutralized to keep pH relativelystable. Given observation 1, we can also hypothesize\nthat there would be more acid than base, sincethe pH of the solution is slightly acidic.\nTo better understand what might be happeningat the molecular level, let's use Legos to\nmodel a solution that meets these criteria,and see if that model correctly predicts all\n4 observations. We'll start with pure water.We could model water molecules using Legos\nbut that would quickly get overwhelming, sowe'll use this blue posterboard instead. Now\nlet's add, say 60 molecules of acid and 40molecules of base. In real solutions, there\nare on the order of 1022 or more moleculesdissolved. That would be a lot of Legos, so\nwe're choosing smaller numbers for convenience.Now, should the acid and base be strong or\nweak? Let's start simple and make them both", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.374}, {"text": "strong. So our acid could be HCl and our base\nNaOH. Here's 60 HCl molecules. This piecerepresents the H+ ion; and this piece represents\nthe Cl- ion. And here's 40 NaOH molecules.This piece represents the Na+ ion and this\npiece the OH- ion. Remember that strong acidsand bases dissociate completely in water,\nso I'm going to take apart all the pieceshere.\nAnd this is our initial model! It containsboth acidic and basic species, and it contains\nmore acid than base. But this solution willnot resist changes in pH. Pause the video\nand explain.The OH- ions would just react with the H+\nions to form neutral water. Since there isan excess of H+ ions, we would be left with\na hydrochloric acid solution after the reaction.And we've already shown that a solution of\na strong acid is not a buffer. So let's goback to our criteria. Remember that to satisfy\nthese criteria we had the option of selectingeither weak or strong acids or bases, and\nlast time we selected the strong/strong case.So this time let's choose a mixture of weak\nand strong; say, a weak acid and strong base.As before, we'll start with the acid. Here\nare 100 molecules of a generic weak acid,HA. Remember, weak acids don't dissociate\ncompletely when dissolved in water. The extentto which a weak acid or base dissociates is\nrelated to the equilibrium constant, Ka foran acid or Kb for a base. These equilibrium\nconstants depend on the chemical structureof the acid or base.

Some of those H+ and A- ions\nwill react with each other to reform HA. Butat any given point after the system has reached\nequilibrium, there will be a fixed numberof HA, H+, and A- ions. Let's say that at\nequilibrium, there will be 96 HA molecules,4 H+ ions and 4 A- ions. The molecule formed\nwhen HA is deprotonated, A-, is called theconjugate base.\nSo now we have a model of our weak acid. Westill have to add our strong base. Let's add\n40 molecules of sodium hydroxide. First, theNaOH would completely dissociate in water.\nNow what? 4 OH- ions react with H+ to formwater. But things don't end there. The remaining\n36 OH- ions react with 36 molecules of HAvia a typical weak acid-strong base reaction,\nforming 36 molecules of A-, the conjugatebase. And we're still not through. Remember\nthat the dissociation of our weak acid HAwas at equilibrium, and we've disturbed the\nequilibrium by adding NaOH. To reestablishequilibrium, our weak acid HA must re-dissociate.\nBut it will do so to a lesser extent thanif it was in pure water, since there are already\na substantial number of molecules of conjugatebase present in solution. Instead of 4 molecules\ndissociating, perhaps 1 will dissociate; the", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.182}, {"text": "exact number could be calculated from the\nequilibrium constant of the acid. So now insolution we have 59 HA molecules, 1 H+ ion,\nand 41 A- ions. This model satisfies the criteriafrom before, but does it explain our four\nobservations from the initial experiment?Pause the video and discuss with a friend.\nFirst, is it acidic? Yes, because it has thatone free H+ in solution. Second, how is it\naffected by addition of acid? Let's add HCl.The H+ ions react with the A- conjugate base,\nforming HA. The pH doesn't change, since allthe added H+ ions are tied up here. So far,\nso good. Third, how is it affected by additionof base? Let's add NaOH. The OH- ions react\nwith HA, forming water and A-. The overallH+ concentration doesn't change, so the pH\nstays the same. Note that in both of thesecases, equilibrium would be re-established\nafter addition of acid or base by a slightadjustment in the dissociation or reformation\nof HA. So the number of H+ ions does changeupon addition of acid or base, but it doesn't\nchange very much, certainly much less thanif this was pure water. Finally, can we exceed\nthe buffering capacity by adding enough acidor base? Definitely: if we add more than 59\nmolecules of strong base or more than 41 moleculesof strong acid, we will use up all the HA\nor A-, and then our solution will no longerbe a buffer.\nAnd there we have it! We've constructed aplausible model of our buffer solution: a\nsolution of a weak acid and its conjugate", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.146}, {"text": "base. You can go through an analogous modeling\nprocess for a weak base and its conjugateacid. That will form a buffer, too. The key\nto the buffering capability of any bufferis that there is a substantial amount of both\nacid and base present at equilibrium. In abuffer made with a weak acid and its conjugate\nbase, the acid acts as a reserve of extraH+ ions that can react with added base, and\nthe conjugate base acts as a sink, a placefor the extra H+ ions from the added acid\nto go. In a buffer made with a weak base andits conjugate acid, the base acts as the H+\nion sink and the conjugate acid acts as theH+ ion reserve.Why would you want to make a buffer solution?\nWell, let's say you're modeling a reactionthat occurs in human blood. Blood is a buffered\nsolution with a pH of about 7.4, so you'dwant to make sure that your experimental system\nis also buffered at this same pH. Or supposeyou study Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium\nwhich colonizes the human stomach. Your experimentalsystem would need to be buffered at around\npH 2. And no matter what your target pH, you'dwant your system to have a high buffer capacity:\nin other words, you want it to be as resistantto pH changes as possible. In designing a\nbuffer solution, you have a lot of choicesto make. Pause the video and suggest a few\nfactors you should consider when designinga buffer solution.\nFirst, you have to choose your specific acid/conjugatebase or base/conjugate acid pair. Then, you\nhave to decide how much of the weak acid orbase you want to use. Finally, you have to\ndecide how much of the conjugate species youwant to have at equilibrium. Each of these\ndecisions affects the pH and buffer capacityof your final buffer solution. Let's look\nat each in turn.We know that a buffer solution has to have\neither a weak acid or weak base; but of course", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.131}, {"text": "\"weak\" encompasses a range of strengths. For\nexample, acetic acid is much stronger thanboric acid, even though both of them are considered\n\"weak\" compared to a strong acid like HCl.The strength of the weak acid used will influence\nthe final pH of the buffer: as you might guess,the stronger the weak acid, the lower the\npH of the final buffer.But we also need sufficient conjugate base\nto make the solution function as a buffer.And so you might also correctly guess that\nthe more of the conjugate base we add, thehigher the pH of the final buffer.\nBut again, that's not all. Remember the physicalsignificance of our weak acid and its conjugate\nbase: the acid is a reserve of extra H+ ionsthat could react with added base, and the\nconjugate base is a sink, a place for extraH+ ions from added acid to go. Would a system\nwith an acid to conjugate base ratio of say,20:1 be an effective buffer? Pause the video.\nSince the acid reserve is 20 times largerthan the conjugate base sink, this buffer\nwould be very good at resisting pH if basewere added, but not very good if acid were\nadded. So, it would be a good buffer in onlyone direction. Intuitively, you might expect\nthat a buffer with an acid:conjugate baseratio of 1:1 provides the widest range over\nwhich the pH is considered buffered, and you'dbe right. Many real-life buffers don't necessarily\nhave a 1:1 ratio, because of other designconsiderations (for example, target pH).\nAnd of course, it's not just the ratio betweenthe acid and its conjugate base that influences\nbuffer capacity. Can you imagine a situationin which the acid and conjugate base are present\nin a 1:1 ratio, but the buffer is still notan effective one? Pause the video.\nSuppose we have a buffer system in which the", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.139}, {"text": "concentrations of weak acid and conjugate\nbase are very low, in the micromolar range.Even though the acid to conjugate base ratio\nis 1:1, their absolute amounts are so smallthat the system would get overwhelmed by the\naddition of even dilute acids or bases.So designing a buffer system requires a delicate\nbalance to make sure that the pH is whereyou want it to be, the ratio between the acid\nand conjugate base is close to 1:1, and thatthere is enough of each species to provide\nadequate buffering capacity.In this video, we created a conceptual model\nof a buffer. We saw that to effectively resistchanges in pH, a buffer must contain a weak\nacid and its conjugate base or a weak baseand its conjugate acid. We also discussed\nsome of the choices that need to be made whendesigning a buffer and how those choices may\nimpact the properties of the buffer.We hope that by better understanding the function\nof various buffer components, this video willgive you some context for many of the calculations\nyou'll need to carry out when dealing withbuffer solutions.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.148}]
