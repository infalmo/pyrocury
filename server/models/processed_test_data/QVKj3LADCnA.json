[{"text": "2 times this equation, Okay.This is it.The second lecture\nin linear algebra,and I've put below my\nmain topics for today.I put right there a\nsystem of equationsthat's going to be our\nexample to work with.But what are we\ngoing to do with it?We're going to solve it.And the method of solution\nwill not be determinants.Determinants are something\nthat will come later.The method we'll use\nis called elimination.And it's the way every software\npackage solves equations.And elimination, well, if it\nsucceeds, it gets the answer.And normally it does succeed.If the matrix A that's\ncoming into that systemis a good matrix, and\nI think this one is,then elimination will work.We'll get the answer\nin an efficient way.But why don't we, as long\nas we're sort of seeing howelimination works -- it's\nalways good to ask how could itfail?So at the same\ntime, we'll see howelimination decides whether\nthe matrix is a good oneor has problems.Then to complete\nthe answer, there'san obvious step of\nback substitution.In fact, the idea\nof elimination is --you would have\nthought of it, right?I mean Gauss thought\nof it before we did,but only because he\nwas born

and why?Okay, so there's a\nsystem of equations.Three equations\nand three unknowns.And there's the matrix, the\nthree by three matrix --so this is the system Ax = b.This is our system\nto solve, Ax equal --and the right-hand side\nis that vector 2, 12, 2.Okay.Now, when I describe\nelimination --it gets to be a pain to\nkeep writing the equal signsand the pluses and so on.It's that matrix\nthat totally matters.Everything is in that matrix.But behind it is\nthose equations.So what does elimination do?What's the first\nstep of elimination?We accept the first\nequation, it's okay.I'm going to multiply that\nequation by the right number,the right multiplier and\nI'm going to subtract itfrom the second equation.With what purpose?So that will decide what\nthe multiplier should be.Our purpose is to knock out\nthe x part of equation two.So our purpose is\nto eliminate x.So what do I multiply --and again, I'll do\nit with this matrix,because I can do it short.", "start": 120.0, "heat":

--that's sort of like the key\nnumber in that equation.And now what's the multiplier?So I'm going to --my first row won't change,\nthat's the pivot row.But I'm going to use it --and now, finally, let me ask\nyou what the multiplier is.Yes?3 times that first equation\nwill knock out that 3.Okay.So what will it leave?So the multiplier is 3.3 times that will make that 0.That was our purpose.3 2s away from the 8 will leave\na 2 and three 1s away from 1will leave a minus 2.And this guy didn't change.Now the next step -- this is\nforward elimination and thatOkay. step's completed.Oh, well, you could say wait\na minute, what about the righthand side?Shall I carry -- the right-hand\nside gets carried along.Actually MatLab finishes up\nwith the left side before --and then just goes back\nto do the right side.Maybe I'll be MatLab for\na moment and do that.Okay.I'm leaving a room for a column\nof b, the right-hand side.But I'll fill it in later.Okay.Now the next step of\nelimination is what?Well,

it to wipe out the\n3, 2 position, right?This was the 2, 1 step.And now I'm going to\ntake the 3, 2 step.So this all stays the\nsame, 1 2 1, 0 2 -1", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.176}, {"text": "and the

these numbersare telling me about.Those are the\nequations U x equals c.Okay, how do I solve them?What one do I solve for first?z.I see immediately that the\ncorrect value of z is negativeAnd what do

get\nfrom U back to A?So reversing steps\nis going to come in.Inverse -- I'll use\nthe word inverse here.Okay.So let me make the first step\nat what's the inverse matrix?All the matrices you've seen\non this board have inverses.I didn't write any\nbad matrices down.We spoke about possible\nfailure, and for a moment,we put in a matrix\nthat would fail.But right now, all\nthese matrices are good,they're all invertible.And let's take the\ninverse -- well,", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.144}, {"text": "let me say first what does\nthe inverse mean and find it?Okay.So we're getting a
