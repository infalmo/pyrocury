[{"text": " OK. So this is the first lecture on eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and that's a big subject that will take up most of the rest of the course. It's, again, matrices are square and we're looking now for some special numbers, the eigenvalues, and some special vectors, the eigenvectors. And so this lecture is mostly about what are these numbers, and then the other lectures are about how do we use them, why do we want them. OK, so what's an eigenvector? Maybe I'll start with eigenvector. What's an eigenvector? So I have a matrix A. OK. What does a matrix do? It acts on vectors. It multiplies vectors x. So the way that matrix acts is in goes a vector x and out comes a vector Ax. It's like a function. With a function in calculus, in goes a number x, out comes f(x). Here in linear algebra we're up in more dimensions. In goes a vector x, out comes a vector Ax. And the vectors I'm specially interested in are the ones the come out in the same direction that they went in. That won't be typical. Most vectors, Ax is in -- points in some different direction. But there are certain vectors where Ax comes out parallel", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " to x. And those are the eigenvectors. So Ax parallel to x. Those are the eigenvectors. And what do I mean by parallel? Oh, much easier to just state it in an equation. Ax is some multiple -- and everybody calls that multiple lambda -- of x. That's our big equation. We look for special vectors -- and remember most vectors won't be eigenvectors -- that -- for which Ax is in the same direction as x, and by same direction I allow it to be the very opposite direction, I allow lambda to be negative or zero. Well, I guess we've met the eigenvectors that have eigenvalue zero. Those are in the same direction, but they're -- in a kind of very special way. So this -- the eigenvector x. Lambda, whatever this multiplying factor is, whether it's six or minus six or zero or even some imaginary number, that's the eigenvalue. So there's the eigenvalue, there's the eigenvector. Let's just take a second on eigenvalue zero. From the point of view of eigenvalues, that's no special deal. That's, we have an eigenvector. If the eigenvalue happened to be zero, that would mean that Ax was zero x, in other words zero. So what would x, where would we look for -- what are the x-s?", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " What are the eigenvectors with eigenvalue zero? They're the guys in the null space, Ax equals zero. So if our matrix is singular, let me write this down. If, if A is singular, then that -- what does singular mean? It means that it takes some vector x into zero. Some non-zero vector, that's why -- will be the eigenvector into zero. Then lambda equals zero is an eigenvalue. But we're interested in all eigenvalues now, lambda equals zero is not, like, so special anymore. OK. So the question is, how do we find these x-s and lambdas? And notice -- we don't have an equation Ax equal B anymore. I can't use elimination. I've got two unknowns, and in fact they're multiplied together. Lambda and x are both unknowns here. So, we need to, we need a good idea of how to find them. But before I, before I do that, and that's where determinant will come in, can I just give you some matrices? Like here you go. Take the matrix, a projection matrix. OK. So suppose we have a plane and our matrix P is -- what I've called A, now I'm going to call it P for the moment, because it's -- I'm thinking OK, let's look at a then this, this other new matrix, I just have an Ax, projection matrix.

My, my point is that we -- before we get into determinants and, and formulas and all that stuff, let's take some matrices where we know what they do. We know that if we take a vector b, what this matrix does is it projects it down to Pb. So is b an eigenvector in, in that picture? Is that vector b an eigenvector? No. Not so, so b is not an eigenvector c- because Pb, its projection, is in a different direction. So now tell me what vectors are eigenvectors of P? What vectors do get projected in the same direction that they start? So, so answer, tell me some x-s. Do you see what3 so it's if Ax equals lambda x, In this picture, where could I start with a vector b or x, do its projection, and end up in the same direction? Well, that would happen if the vector was right in that plane already. If the vector x was -- so let the vector x -- so any vector, any x in the plane will be an eigenvector.

So any x in the plane is unchanged by P, and what's that telling me? That's telling me that x is an eigenvector, and it's also telling me what's the eigenvalue, which is -- just compare it with that. The eigenvalue, the multiplier, is just one. Good. So we have actually a whole plane of eigenvectors. Now I ask, are there any other eigenvectors? And I expect the answer to be yes, because I would like to get three, if I'm in three dimensions, I would like to hope for three independent eigenvectors, two of them in the plane and one not in the plane.

I compute the determinant, so I get a three minus lambda times a three minus lambda. And nothing. So that's where the triangular part came in. Triangular part, the one thing we know about triangular matrices is the determinant is just the product down the diagonal. And in this case, it's this same, repeated -- so lambda one is one -- sorry, lambda one is three and lambda two is three. That was easy. I mean, no -- why should I be pessimistic about a matrix", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " whose eigenvalues can be read off right away? The problem with this matrix is in the eigenvectors. So let's go to the eigenvectors. So how do I find the eigenvectors? I'm looking for a couple of eigenvectors. Singular, right? It's supposed to be singular. And then it's got some vectors -- which it is. So it's got some vector x in the null space. And what, what's the, what's -- give me a basis for the null space for that guy. Tell me, what's a vector x in the null space, so that'll be the, the eigenvector that goes with lambda one equals three. The eigenvector is -- so what's in the null space? One zero, is it? Great. Now, what's the other eigenvector? What's, what's the eigenvector that goes with lambda two? Well, lambda two is three again. So I get the same thing again. Give me another vector -- I want it to be independent. If I'm going to write down an x2, I'm never going to let it be dependent on x1.", "start": 2880.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " I'm looking for independent eigenvectors, and what's the conclusion? There isn't one. This is a degenerate matrix. It's only got one line of eigenvectors instead of two. It's this possibility of a repeated eigenvalue opens this further possibility of a shortage of eigenvectors. And so there's no second independent eigenvector x2. So it's a matrix, it's a two by two matrix, but with only one independent eigenvector. So that will be -- the matrices that -- where eigenvectors are -- don't give the complete story. OK. My lecture on Monday will give the complete story for all the other matrices. Thanks. Have a good weekend. A real New England weekend.", "start": 3000.0, "heat": 0.1}]
