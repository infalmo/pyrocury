So wewere talking about the\nderivative with respectto time of this vector.And we can make it up as a sum\nof the derivatives with respectto time of these\nother two vectors.But now there's a\nreally important point.When you're taking\ntime derivatives,you have to be\nexplicit about whatit's with respect to--\nwhat frame of referenceyou're talking about.In this case we want to know\nthe velocity with respectto this reference frame.So both of these\nderivatives haveto be taken with\nrespect to that frame.Well this one's easy.This is purely translational.It has nothing to do\nwith rotations, or won't.We're going to think in terms\nof having an object out here.So maybe a rigid body to which\nwe have attached a rotatingframe at A.

justintuitively-- appeal\nto your intuitionabout why this should be.So this is my merry-go-round.And I've set up my\nlittle coordinate system.This is my A, x prime y\nprime coordinate system.I've stuck my dog\nhere on the x-axis.And if he's running\nsome direction,he has a velocity with respect\nto this reference frame.If you're here at A, watch\nit, and you'll see him moving.And it will have nothing\nto do with the rotation.You will just see\nthe dog moving.And if this is rotating, and\nyou're sitting there rotatingwith it watching the dog, does\nthe motion of the dog change?You just see it just\nthe same way, right?OK.So there's one part of the\nmotion of the dog that'swith respect to\nthis frame that hasnothing to do with rotation.OK.So now let's say in an outside,\nand from an
