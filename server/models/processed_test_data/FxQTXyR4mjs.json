[{"text": "[Music]hieveryone and welcome to my channel it iscurrently half past3 am and i am filming a youtube video soit better be worth it and you bettergive this video a thumbs upso in this video i want to show you howyou can builda c plus application with user interfacein just a couple of minutesand it is going to be very easy you willsee so here i am going to insertthe final result and the applicationthat we are going to build in this videothis is the application that we aregoing to build it is a to-do listapp and it has a couple of components soit hasa label which says add task and then aninput field where we are going to typethe text of our taskand then a button which says add and itis used in order to addthe task that we type here into thislist box hereand here we will see the list of all ofour tasksso let's demonstrate how the app isgoing to work let's typetask 1 and let's add that task and asyou can seeit has been added into this list herelet's addanother task let's say task 2and then task 3task 4 and so on so that isthe first functionality and then thesecond functionality that i haveimplementedis removing existing tasks from thislist here so in order to remove a taskyou justclick on it as you can see so again andagainand again and this means that we havesuccessfully completed all of our tasksin order to build this app i'm going touse c plus builder and rad studioand first i'm going to show you how toinstall it soi will leave a link in the descriptionthat you can use in order to download itand try it out for freeso as i said the first step is to show",

toinstallthe one that i will select is c plusbuilder windows enterprisetrial and i'm going to unselect theseother onesokay and i am going to click continueokay and here you can select additionallanguages helpsamples and so on i will just clickinstall so that it finishes fasterand the installation process shouldstart once more and this one is going totake a little bit longer so againi will be back once this is finished andwhen the installation finishes you willclick startworking okay andnow the rad studio should startokay here you will select the theme i", "start": 120.0,

components that we are going to useand then we are going to build theapplication that you saw at thebeginning of thisvideo so let's create a new projectyou can click here on create a newmulti-device application with cbuilder or you can click on filenew and then otherokay and here you are going to seemulti-device application and it saysthatmulti-device application is an uiapplicationthat works on any operating system ordeviceso that is what we are going to selectand i will clickok and then here i am going to selectblank application and i will clickok again after you create a new projectyou will geta window that looks like this and therearefour parts of this window that i want toexplain because we will use them a lotand that is projects part in the upperright cornerand then structure in the upper left andthen we have object inspector in thebottomleft and in the bottom right corner wehave thispalette and if you don't see any oneof these four what you can do is you canclick on viewand then tool windows and here you haveall of these and you can enablewhichever one you want soproject structure object inspectorpaletteand so on okay so now i'm going toexplainwhat each one of these four is used forinside this projects part we have all ofthe files that our application containsand there are three that i want toexplain and focus onand those are under this unit 1.cppand as you can see you can collapse it", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.383}, {"text": "and expand itand those three are unit1.cpp unit1.fmxand then unit1.h so this unit1.cppand unit1.h are used to write cplus code and then this unit1.fmx isused to store the information aboutthe design of your application so if youclickor actually double click on the unit1.cppyou are going to get c plus code andthen unit 1.has well contains c plus plus code andthen if you double click on unit 1.fmxhere you have the design of yourapplication which isjust an empty blank form because wecreated an empty applicationso that is the first way to navigatebetween thesethree and then another way is at thebottomyou have a tab control which has unit1.cppunit1.h and then the design mode of yourapplication and you can use thatas well so let's move to this upper leftcorner where it says structureand here we will have all of thecomponents slashcontrols that our application containsand currently our application containsonly one form which is completely emptybecause we createda blank application but if you decide toaddnew controls to your application liketext labelsinput fields buttons list boxes and soonthose are going to be shown here as wellso now your question might beokay selena but how can i add newcontrols or components to my applicationand the answer is very easy so let'smove to this bottomright corner where it says palette andinside this palette we have a lot of thecomponents which are already availablefor youto use so you can basically drag anddrop them and you don't have to writethe codeyourself which is going to save you alot of time solet's see what kind of components wehave under this standardcategory so standard components are", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "components like buttons checkboxes radiobuttonswhat else labels image controls progressbarsscroll bars and so on and you can checkthis out on your own after you finishthis videoso that is what we use this palettewindow forand let's drag and drop a couple ofcomponents solet's use this label component i'm goingto put it hereand then let's add an input field it'scalled tedit so you can search it here you cantype tedit and here it is i'm going to dragand drop that as welli'll put it here and i'll just make it alittle bitbigger like this and align it with mylabelokay and then let's add a buttonit is here i'm going to place ithere and i will also make it the samesize asmy input field okay maybe i'll make thisinput field a little bitbigger like this and then anothercomponent that i'm going to needis a list box so a place where i'm goingto show my tasks solet's search for list boxhere it is and i will put it hereand make it the same size as my inputfieldlike this okay and let's adjust the sizeof thisform okay perfect sohere we have added all of the componentsthat our application is going to containand you can even run your applicationnow so let'sdo that let's see what's going to happenokay no errors and here is ourapplicationas you can see it contains all of thecomponents that we need but ourapplication is currently dumbwhich means that it does not have anylogic so this button here for exampledoes not know how to behavewhen it is clicked so that is the nextthing that i want to change i am goingto stop my applicationand let's see the first thing that i", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "want to changeis the text of this label so i'm goingto click on this labeland if you look at this bottom left partwhere it saysobject inspector you will notice thathere we have propertiesand events and this propertiestab contains all the properties of thecontrol that has been selectedso in this situation we selected ourlabel controland here you can change all of theproperties of your labeland the property that i want to changeis called textso let's find that okayhere it says label one and that is thetext that is shown hereso that is what i want to change iwanted to say for exampleadd task like this and i will pressenter and as you can see the text hasbeenchanged okay so that is the first thingthat i want to do and thenlet's change also the text of thisbutton hereso if i click on this button againon this object inspector window you willhave all the properties and events ofthisbutton and later i'm going to explainwhat are events and how to work withevents for now i'm focusing only onproperties partso click on button and then selectproperties and here you can change theproperties of your buttonthe one that i want to change again iscalled textso let's do that instead of havingbutton one texton this button let's say addlike this and i'm going to press enterokay soif i run my application again as you canseehere we have add task and then addbutton so now we have a better idea ofwhatthis application here is doing in orderto make it easier to work with thesecontrolslet's change their names so that theymake more senseand let me show you what i mean by thisso if i click on this add buttonproperties and i look for a name", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "propertyyou will notice that the name of thisbutton here isbutton one and then if i click on thisinput fieldyou will notice that its name is editone and then if i click on the list boxthe name of the list box is list box onesothe same way that you should givemeaningful names to your variablesyou should also give meaningful names toyour controls becauseif you have for example 10 buttons inyour application and you leave them withtheir default names of button 1 button 2button 3 and so onit is just a matter of time when you aregoing to forgetwhat button 3 means or what button 7means and so onso that is the reason why you should usemeaningful names for your controls solet's do that i'm going to click on thisbutton and instead of having the name ofbutton1i'm going to change it so that its nameis addbutton or add task button you can usewhichever name you wantas long as it is meaningful so let'spress enter hereand then i'm going to click on thisinput fieldits name is edit i am going to call itfor exampletask edit or you can call it task inputfield whichever name you findeasier to remember so i'm going to savethe changehere as well and then i will click on mylist boxand the name of this list box will betaskslist box okay like thisso what we have achieved with this isthat when we want to refera specific component from our c pluscodewe are going to use the name of thatcomponentand it is going to be much easier for usif that component hasa meaningful name now one thing thatjust happenedand you noticed that if you paidattention since the beginning of thisvideois the following inside this structurewindownow we have additional four components", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "and those four components are part ofthisform one so in the beginning we had formone and now we haveadd button which is this button here andthen label oneas you can see we have not changed thename of this label here that is whyit has the default name of label one andthentask edit which is this input field hereand thentask list box which is this list boxhereand here are the names of all of ourcomponentsthat our application contains so if irun this application nownothing has changed in terms of theappearance of the applicationbut what has changed is that the namesofall of these components are different sowhen we decide to use those componentsfrom our ccode we are going to use those namesthat we assignedto each one of these three componentsthe next thing that i want to do is iwant to implement the logic for thisapplication here so when i type the textinside this input field when i say forexample thisis task 1 and i click on thisadd button it should add this text to mylist oftasks so that is the next thing that iwant to do and in order to know how todo thatyou will first need to understand alittle bit about events and how to workwith eventsso that is the next thing that i'm goingto explain so what isan event in programming an event is justan action that can be caused by the useror by the software itselfthe examples of some events are forexamplea mouse click and that event is calledon clickor when you press a key and that eventis called on keydown or for example when you hoverover a button and that event is calledon hoveror on mouse enter depending on thelanguage in which you workthe naming is a little bit different butthe logic is absolutely", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "the same so one event is when you hoverover a button and then another event iswhen you leavethat button so let me show you how thishover eventworks because it is implemented bydefault so i'm going to run myapplicationand if i hover over this addbutton as you can see it becomes blue sosomeone has written the code which sayson hoverplease become blue and that pleasebecome blue partis called event handler which means thatthat is the behavior that is going tohappenwhen a certain event is raised sowhat i want to do now is i want tohandle another event which ismouse click that event is called onclickand the behavior that i want on click ofthis buttonhere is i want to take text from thisinput field this task edit and i want toadd thattask to my task list box sothat is the event that we are going tohandle now let's closethis application and as i said the eventthat i want to handle will be the eventof thisbutton here and i'm going to switch tothis eventstab and i will find event called onclickand here if i want to create an event ijust need to double clickon this input field and as you can seetwo things happened the first one isthat we created a function calledadd button click and here we are goingto implement that function so here weare going to writethe code of what is going to happen whenadd buttonis clicked and then this function alsohas been connected with thison click event which means that whenthat buttonis clicked so on click please invokethisfunction here and as i said here we aregoing to describe the behavior of thatfunction and one tip if you're notfamiliar with functions i will link in", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "the upper right cornera playlist where i explain everythingthat you need to know about functionsand i will also link that playlist inthe description of this video so makesure to watch thatif you don't understand what arefunctions so now if you watched all ofmy previous videos you can see howall the things that i explained cometogether and make perfectsense so before i implementthis function let me show you veryquickly what haschanged in these other files so if iopen my designtab you will notice that nothing haschanged in terms of designand then in this unit 1.h we have addeda declaration of function called addbutton clickokay and then inside this unit 1.cppwe are going to implement that functionso once more what i want to happen whenadd button is clicked is the followinglet's move to design mode and when thisbutton is clicked i want to take thetextfrom this input field which is calledtaskedit and i want to add that text tomy tasks list box so that is the codethat i will write in myunit 1.cpp so here i'm going to create avariable of typestring and i will call it tasktext like this so i want to access acontrol calledtask edit so i will say taskedit and i want to access its propertycalledtext like this and make sure to usethis pointer because if you use a dot itis notgoing to work so again make sure to usethis symbol here okay so with thiswe have taken the text from our taskedit and we have stored that textinside this string variable that is thefirst stepand the second step is to add this task", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "text into our list box so i will referto my list boxand its name is tasks list boxlike this and i want to access the itemsof my tasks list box so i will sayitems and then what i want to do is iwant to adda new item so i will useadd method and that item will be thistext here so i will pass a parameterwhichis the text from our task edit andwith this we have successfullyimplemented the handler foradd button click so if i run my programnow let's see what is going to happenokay perfect so let's type for exampletask1 and let's click add and as you can seethis task has been added to our taskslist let's add another taskokay and then third taskforth and so on now one thing that iwould like to happenis when i add this task i would likethis text to be deleted so let's addthat code as welli'm going to close the program and hereafter i have addedthe task to my tasks list box and what iwant to do is i want to saythat the text of my taskedit is now going to be equal to anemptystring like this so if i run my programagainokay and if i add task1 and click add as you can see the texthas been cleared let's add another taskadd and again the text has been clearedso that is the first functionalityand the second functionality that i wantto implement iswhen i click a specific item of thislisti want that task to be removed which", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "means that that task has been completedso i remove it from mylist okay so that is anotherfunctionality that we are going toimplementand in order to implement thatfunctionality we need to handleanother event so let's switch to ourdesign modeand the event that we want to implementis the event of thislist box here and that event is calledonitem click so let's find thatevent it is here so when an item of thislist box is clicked what do we want tohappenso again in order to implement the eventwe need todouble click on this field here and asyou can seeit has added task list box item clickso it has added a method which we aregoing to implementhere again the declaration of thatmethod has beenadded inside our unit 1.hnothing has changed in terms of ourdesign and then we are going toimplementthat method here so if i scroll up youare going to see that here is theimplementation of our add button clickevent and thenbelow it we are going to implement taskslist boxitem click so what do we want to happenwhen an item of our listis clicked the answer is we want toremove thatitem so how we are going to do that wellwe are going to use one of these twoparameters that we receivedinside this function so if you payattentionthis function has two parameters thefirst one isthe sender and then the second one whichwe are going to useis called item and this item representsthe exact item of our list that has beenclicked so if you have a list that hasthree tasks for example and you clickon the second one here you are going togetthat second task so we need to remove", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "this item from our list now the way toremoveitems from a list box is by using theirindex so the same way that an array hasindexesa list also has indexes sowhat we need to do is we need to askthis itemhey what is your index and then we aregoing to tell to our list boxplease remove the item that has thatspecificindex so let's do that so the firstthing that i want to dois create an int variable called indexand what i want to store inside thisindex variable isindex of this item here soi am going to say itemindex again make sure to use thispointer because if you use dot it's notgoing to workokay so here we have the index of theitem that has been clickedand now what we need to do is we need toremove the item with that index from ourlist box so in order to do that i willsaytasks list box like thisitems deleteokay and this delete method receives theindex of the item that we want to deleteso i'm going to say please delete theitem that hasthis index here so with this we havesuccessfullyimplemented item click event on our listboxso if i run my program now let's seewhat is going to happenso let's move it here andlet's add a task let's say task oneadd and then task two addtask three okay that's enough so ifi click a specific task as you can seethat task is going to beremoved and then this one and this one", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "as wellso those are two functionalities that iwanted to show you butthis application also has some bugsand the first part that i notice is thatthis add buttonwill add a new task even if this fieldis empty soit will add an empty task basically soif i click add at addand if i add for example task5 as you can see that task is going tobeadded on this position here because herewe have tasks withempty text and you can remove thosetasksas you can see so that is one bug thati'm going to leave to youso that you can fix it on your own andthen if you find any other way toupgrade this application and addsome additional features feel free toleave your ideas in the comments sectionso thank you very much for watchingplease give this video a thumbs up forthe youtube algorithmbecause that helps me a lot to reachmore people and then also share it withsomeone who would like to learnprogramming because that wayour community is going to grow faster sothat is all for this video it'scurrently 5 amand i have to go to
