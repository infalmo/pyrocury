right at the\nheart of the financial system,are thinking about blockchain.And we're going to do\nthis over two classes.We're fortunate that we\nhave some real expertisein the room, and I'm not\ntalking about myself.But Rob Ali, who ran the digital\nefforts at the Bank of England,and is now--and has been for some time--\npart of the digital currencyinitiative over\nat the Media Lab,is going to come up from time to\ntime and give his perspective.Not only from MIT's\nMedia Lab's perspective,but also from the history\nof what he's done.He's authored a number\nof papers in this area.He works with\ntechnologists creatinga number of technologies.But I'll let Rob tell you\na little bit about whathe's doing in central banking.Simon Johnson's\nalso joined us, whois a former chief economist\nof the International MonetaryFund.He's told me he doesn't\nwant to be called on,but I will call on Simon to give\nhis perspective at some pointin time, from the IMF days.But as you all know,\nSimon is Sloan faculty,a great teacher, himself,\nteaches a lot of youin the global markets\ncourse and the GLAB course,and things like that.And Simon and I in the\nspring teach a public policyand private sector\ncourse, which is just onemore time for me to plug that\nthat's a good course, too.So now, let's just talk a\nlittle bit about central banking", "start": 0.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "and blockchain.First, what are we going to do?A little bit about our readings\nand the study questions.We're going to start\nwith Fiat currency,and go back again\nto Fiat currency,and how does it fit\ninto central banking.So the first 20% or\n30% of today is reallyjust about what\nis a central bank,and how does it fit into money?Then, how are central\nbanks thinkingabout blockchain technology?What are their approaches?And we're going to talk about\nfour different approachesthat central banks are taking\nto blockchain technology.Then dive into one of those four\napproaches-- payment systems,and how are they looking at\npayment systems right now.Dive into probably the most\ninteresting one-- central bankdigital currency, and what's\ncalled the money flower.You might remember\nthat money flowerthat was in the BIS\nreport, and so forth.And then just wrap it up.So that's a little bit of\nwhat we're trying to do.The study questions were\nreally about central banking--what are they thinking about?How are they thinking about\ndigital reserves, and so forth?Because I have a\nguest with me, I'mnot going to do as\nmuch cold calling,because we're going\nto leave time for Robto get up here and give some of\nhis thoughts as we go through.But the key\nquestions were reallyhow are central banks\nthinking about central bankdigital currency?How might they think of\nthe design considerations--which we're going to dive\ninto in the latter partof the class.Designing retail\nversus wholesale.Access-- should it be a\ntoken or account-based?Interest bearing or not?And we'll talk a lot Thursday\nabout why Sweden right now iscome out with their most\nrecent paper, which was notin assigned reading,\nbecause the paper came outabout a week ago.But they're saying they're\nthinking they should make itinterest bearing, which I\nwouldn't have necessarilypredicted.But that's where their thinking\nis as of October of 2018.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.159},

these were the readings.I apologize, because\nthis week is probablya little heavy reading,\nwhich meant you all skimmedrather than actually dove in.One of these\nreadings, Broadbent--Rob did you help write this\nspeech that Broadbent wrote?ROBLEH ALI: No, I confess,\nthis is all Ben's work.And I reviewed a draft\nthat he sent roundand made some\ncomments on it, but Ican't claim any

gave testimony\nin front of the US Congresson these issues, is often quoted\nby the Bank of InternationalSettlement and others.So if there were two that you\nreally want to think about--the economics of money and\ncentral bank digital currency,Garratt and Broadbent\nare picked up a lot.The Economist piece\nwas kind of lively,and walked us all the\nway back to Adam Smith.Did anybody read The Economist\npiece and remember what he--anybody remember\nthe Adam-- so James?AUDIENCE: He basically\nargued everythingthat's done right and wrong\nwith Fiat currencies, exactlywhat's happening with Bitcoin.GARY GENSLER: It's exactly\nwhat's happening with Bitcoin.In The Economist piece, it\ntalks about in the 1770s, whenthey started to move a bit away\nfrom gold money to paper money,and they set up a\nclearing house in 1773to deal with the paper that was\ngoing amongst and between allthe banks.That Adam Smith\napparently wrote that itwas wagon wheels in\nthe air, and that gold", "start":

as the means to\npay taxes for that [INAUDIBLE]..GARY GENSLER: Right, so taxes.And what was the other big\none that almost every countryyou can use it for?Pria, were you looking at

three forms of money--we can all have\ncash in our pocket,as I commonly pull\nout, this here, right.I'm going to watch you,\nHugo, I'm going to watch you.No, no, but what is\nthat right there?AUDIENCE: Federal Reserve note?GARY GENSLER: Right.That Federal Reserve\nnote is a representationthat at the central bank they're\nstoring some value for me.It's got a serial number.That piece

than\nquantitative easing,I think that this whole sense--that Satoshi Nakamoto\ntapped into, too--is central institutions\nare failing.So should there be a\nrun to physical cash?Is this-- it's not

what's\nlargely happening.Or can they put some quota\nsystem, or by government Fiat--like an India, where\nthey said, no, youhave to hand in all\nthe old banknotes?And there was an\nactive desire in

the\nbusiness school at Yale.But the French had asked\nfor some of their gold back.And they got it back.But then the British started\nto make noise, Bank of England,started make noise that they\nwanted some of their gold back.And Richard Nixon\nhad a challenge.So he decided he'd just take\nus off the gold standard.There's a lot of\nhistorians' debatewhether the Bank of\nEngland forced it or not.Simon?SIMON JOHNSON: It\nwasn't their gold,it was our gold-- they\nwanted to exchangetheir dollars for our gold.That's what Nixon didn't want--GARY GENSLER: I see, I see.So Professor Johnson is\nsaying, it was actually--SIMON JOHNSON: US gold.GARY GENSLER: Wait, it was\nthe US gold, or the UK's gold?SIMON JOHNSON: They had dollar\nbalances that they accumulated,which was all fair and good.And under Bretton Woods, you\ncould convert your dollarbalances into gold, until\nRichard Nixon said youcouldn't.GARY GENSLER: Right.And so the question\nwas, whose gold was it?", "start":

this\nintermediated central bankdigital reserve\ncalled bank deposits,but should we have\nsomething direct to us?", "start": 3720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Like cash is a\ndirect relationshipbetween the central\nbank and the holder.That's really the strategic\nquestion, when you--I believe when you move\naway from the technology,you don't know have to\nknow about hash functionsor anything.That's the strategic question.Why do I think there's\nsome opportunities?And we're going to dive\nmore into this Thursday,but I want Rob to see if he\nwants to speak about thisand tell us.I think this is\na real question--and Sweden has highlighted it--they want a\ncontinued involvementin the means of payment.Sweden is already down to\nabout 2% of GDP, or 1/2% of GDPis their kronas--the physical kronas-- the\nUS is still at 8% or 9%.But they're saying\nnobody is acceptingphysical kronas anymore\nin Sweden and Norway,and so forth.Pretty soon, most retailers\nwill not take them.So they're saying,\nmaybe the governmentneeds to have a continued\ndirect relationship.Could it promote competition\nin the banking system?Because otherwise,\nif you don't have it,then the banks are controlling\nthe payment system,and the means of payment.Promoting financial\ninclusion-- not everybodywill have a bank account.Well, maybe they could\nhave some digital formof central bank money\ninstead of a bank account.The pain points-- and I\nwould say for some countries,some countries are clearly\nlooking at central bankdigital currencies to\navoid US sanctions.Venezuela and Iran both have\nprojects for central bankdigital currency.Sorry, question?And so here, of course,\nblockchain technologycould be relevant.For these six reasons,\nor five reasons,you didn't need\nblockchain technology.But I'm going to say, blockchain\ntechnology could be relevant--Fiat currencies on a ledger,\nverification and networkingcosts are critical to\nthe economics of money.So I wouldn't count blockchain\ntechnology out of this,because blockchain technology\ncan lower verification", "start": 3840.0, "heat": 0.224}, {"text": "and networking costs.But I think we're too early\nto know whether blockchaintechnology will be at the\ncenter of central bankdigital currency.But it could have an effect.So the challenges.And again, we'll dive\nmore of these Thursday.Rob, you want to say anything\nabout these challenges?ROBLEH ALI: Yeah,\nI mean, I thinkBen's speech was good on--GARY GENSLER: Ben\nBroadbent's speech.ROBLEH ALI: Yeah, Ben\nBroadbent's speechis good on that one.Because I think the\nfundamental one is this--how do you fund a productive\nenterprise in the real economy?Right, that's the real--GARY GENSLER: How do you--ROBLEH ALI: How do you\nfund productive enterprisein the real economy?And at the moment, certainly\nin the UK and Europe,and I guess to a lesser\nextent in the US,but it's largely true\nfor the US, as well,is that you are very much\nreliant on bank lending.And if you do something which\nessentially drains depositsfrom banks, are you like\nfundamentally changingthe nature of the system?And how are you going\nto create a systemwhich allows people to fund\nmortgages, or fund businesses,or whatever it is?And I think that's\nthe big challenge.So I think that's like the\ncentral question, whichI think is the\nbullet three, effectson credit allocation\nin the economy,is the thing that I think weighs\non central bankers the most.GARY GENSLER: So basically, if\nyou disintermediate the banks,and the banks are\nnot collecting--again, using US numbers--\n$13 trillion of deposits,but only $12 trillion of\ndeposits, or maybe $6 trillionof deposits, what are we\ndoing to credit allocation?Because for three\nto five centuries,or certainly since the\nIndustrial Revolution,banks form an important\nfeature in our economyto promote the\nextension of credit.And we had this six or eight\nlectures ago, this graphthat in the US, debt to\nour economy is about 3.8,or 380% of our economy in\ndebt it's not all bank debt,", "start": 3960.0, "heat": 0.403}, {"text": "but bank debt is a\nbig piece of that.Can you move credit allocation\naway from the banking system?Well, the answer has got\nto be in some level, yes,but what are the pros\nand cons of doing that?It's not whether you\ncan, it's whether it'sa better system, a better\neconomy, better growthwith or without it.Shawn?AUDIENCE: I was just\ncurious, can youuse different interest\nrates to representdifferent level of risk?And then use a differentiation\nand interest point as a wayto fund the corporates, so\nthey can get the loan faster,or they can get the [INAUDIBLE]?GARY GENSLER: So the\nquestion is, could you useinterest rates to try to do it?Which leads us to\ndesign considerations.Which is basically, I\nlisted that the last one.You could have a central\nbank digital currencythat had zero interest rate--interestingly, we'll\ntalk more Thursday--Sweden said no.They think they'd put\nan interest rate on it.But you could go\nno interest rate.And I'd like to\nhear your thoughtsThursday, well, why did\nSweden come out there?And what does that make sense?You could put limits\nor caps on it,and say, these are only\nlow dollar accounts.You can only have X 100\neuro, or X 100 krona,or Y number of dollars.And it's really just small\ntransactional accounts,equivalent to $20 bills,\nnot $100 or 500 euro notes.So you can put limits or\ncaps, or no interest rates,and so forth.Do you make it widely\naccessible, and so forth?So there's all these\ndesign considerations,which I'm guessing\nRob, you've talkedto a bunch of central banks.Where do they come out on these\nissues, as you see it, in 2018?ROBLEH ALI: You've got a lot\nof different opinions on it.I think the limits and\ncaps thing is a hard thingto practically implement.That was always the\nsort of skepticismaround that-- it's like if\nyou have these accounts,and you say, well, we're going\nto only have one per person,", "start": 4080.0, "heat": 0.231}, {"text": "we're going to cap it at\na certain amount of money.What practically\nhappens in a wrong--is the government really\ngoing to say, well, no,you can't put any more--Like there'll be a lot\nof political pressurein any crisis, so I think caps\nare really seen as viable.And then, I think the interest\nbearing thing is interesting.I mean, the only\nreason cash doesn'tbear interest is because it's\ntechnologically difficultto make a paper bear interest.So I think with\ndigital currency,they might as well give\nyourself the option.Say, yeah, well, we can\nset the interest rateto zero if you want to, but\nwhy limit yourself to say,well, we won't charge interest?Because it's again--\nit's like that'sa limitation that comes\nfrom the technologyof physical banknotes,\nand there's no real needto import it into the digital\nworld, when you could achievethe same effect by just\nsetting the rate at zeroif you want to.GARY GENSLER: And one of the\nreasons that some countries areexploring this\noption, is they thinkit'll be easier to\ndo monetary policy,because you're going to have\nnegative interest rates.Physical cash makes it\nhard for-- oh, nobodylike that, huh?No, the two Elenes, you don't\nlike negative interest rates?But for a while, we effectively\nhad negative interest rates.Certainly for\ncorporate deposits.But if everything was digital,\nand there was no physical cash,central banks say\nwe could actuallygo and have no lower bound, no\nzero bound to interest rates.ROBLEH ALI: I guess\nyou, in a way,you don't necessarily need that.Because if you can\njust create more moneyand pump it into the economy,\nit has the same effect, right?GARY GENSLER: Right,\nso what Rob is sayingis you could affect\nthat by supply of money,rather than the\npricing of money.And so there's both.One of the most interesting to\nme is the second bullet point--is a token or account based.And the two merge\ntogether, in a sense.This piece of paper is a token.", "start": 4200.0, "heat": 0.332}, {"text": "Nobody's keeping an account that\nwhen I hand this to Rob-- here,you can take it, Rob.That's your fee, remember.So that's a token based\nbit of money, that'swhat is called token based.Token based money\nis more anonymous,and you can keep\nit more anonymous.Account base is\nwhen you're actuallykeeping the ownership\nsomewhere on a registry.Even though that $20 bill\nis registered somewhere,it has a serial number, it's\na token based bit of money.The Swedes, interestingly, say\nthey'd have to change the law--their own central bank\nlaws-- for one of these two.And now I can't remember.But they have-- if\nit's token base,it would come under\ntheir e-money laws,and I think they don't need\nto change the law to do that.But in Sweden, they would have\nto change their central banklaws to do e-deposits,\nbecause they would literallybe opening up their central\nbank to something otherthan commercial banks.That's it-- they have to go\nto their legislative bodyand parliament to actually\ndo an account based, and nota token based, if I recall.So there's some\nalso legal reasonswhy you might need to\ndo one or the other,but one would have more\nanonymity than the other.ROBLEH ALI: I think\nit's worth noting,on these token versus\naccount models,it's not well-defined what\npeople mean when they say takenand accounts.So different central\nbanks will say this,and mean different things.And also people who work on\nBitcoin will think about--so when I see tokens, I think\nabout particular structureand transactions,\nwhich Bitcoin has.And when I think\nabout accounts, Ithink of structure of\ntransactions that Ethereum has.And that's how I distinguish\nbetween those two things.But I think having spoken to\ndifferent central bankers,they think about it differently,\nbecause e-money is like--you could think about it as--I mean to me, that's an\naccount based system.", "start": 4320.0, "heat": 0.375}, {"text": "But some bankers\nthink about it--some central bankers think\nabout that as token based.So it's worth noting\nthat the definitions arevery fluid in this area.GARY GENSLER: So we're going\nto save this for Thursday.I'm not going to\ngo through this--it was in one of the readings.Garratt, who\ntestified in Congress,was so popular with\nthis, then the Bankof International Settlement\npicked up this thingcalled the money flower.But I'm going to save this, I\nwant to kick this to Thursday.But it's basically\nthe four things--widely accessible, is it\ndigital, is its central bank,is it token based?And depending upon\nwhere these intersect,you can take any form of money.You could say, well, it's\nnot central bank issued,its token based,\nprivate digital tokens,is down on the right hand corner\nis one little piece of it.It's just a way to take these\nfour important features.And we already have\ncentral bank digital money,which is in the middle of all\nthis, it's called reserves.But we're going to hold\nthis for Thursday--but this crazy\nlittle money flower,central bankers who\nare in this world,they've been using this, because\nthis Professor Garratt came upwith it.I mean, I've seen\nthis in other papers.ROBLEH ALI: It's very important.GARY GENSLER: They\nlove it, you know.I don't know.Money and flowers\ntogether, there you go.But Rob, I don't\nknow if you wantto come up and help\nclose it, but theseare the ones we're going\nto talk about on Thursday.And since Rob won't\nbe here on Thursday,I'm kind of curious if he has a\npoint of view on any of these--and you can see\nthem here, as well.ROBLEH ALI: The UK one is\nactually being stopped.So I read something recently\nthat the UK government--I assume at the prompting\nof the Bank of England,although their fingerprints\nare not directly on it,I can imagine that\nthey were behind it.I think Uruguay is\nan interesting one.I recently went\nto a presentation", "start": 4440.0, "heat": 0.382}, {"text": "by Uruguay central bank,\nand what's interesting aboutthat project is that it was\nactually live and out therein the hands of people,\npaying for things in shops.And I think that's\nwhat distinguishes itfrom a lot of the\nother projects.So for example, the\nones that Gary's talkedabout earlier in, say,\nSingapore and Canada,are really just in-house\ncreative concepts,whereas the Uruguay\nproject was somethingthat actually has worked, and\nthey've taken an early form.The Swedish one, again,\nis fairly early stage.The e-krona is\nnot out there yet,they're just starting\nto explore it.The Tunisia one\nwas interesting--I've spoken to one of\nthe guys working on that.And again, that's interesting\nbecause it's a live project.It's continuing-- unlike\nthe Uruguayan project,it's a continuing project.So it'll be interesting to\nsee how it plays out there.And I think the reason being\nis a lot of the thing thatputs off central banks\nfrom actually doing it,is they don't know what effect\nit would have on the bankingsystem, or whatever.And I think you\nwill start to see--when you start to see\npeople actually tryingit, and deploying a central\nbank digital currencyin the real economy,\nthen you willhave a real pilot, or\na real world example,that you can then\nresearch and say,well, actually the\neffect was this.Because at the moment, a lot of\nthe debate around central bankdigital currency, what\nwould be the effectbe on the banking system?This is conjecture,\nyou can build a model.But it's very difficult.But I think once you start\nto see countries actuallyissue them, then you\nget the evidence in.And then I think you'll\nsee a cascade effect.It will be very quickly, then,\nthe technology is proven out,and then more and more\ncountries will issue them.And also because of\nthe funding effect,Gary talked earlier\nabout the cash--like US dollars, physical cash,\nis effectively $1.6 trillionof interest-free borrowing\nby the US government.And if, say, the US government\nissued digital dollars,then arguably you could\nretire half the national debtand replace it with money.So there are these big\nfiscal implications.", "start": 4560.0, "heat": 0.327}, {"text": "And the Body of the\nCommonwealth paper,which my colleagues at\n[INAUDIBLE] wrote, I think,two years ago, sort of\naddresses that fiscal element.And I think that will be a\nbig attraction to politicianslooking to spend money.GARY GENSLER: And\nbefore we close, Simon,because you're rarely with\nus, but from your perspective,either from your chief\neconomist days at the IMF,or just because you--Simon hosts the Tuesday night\nblockchain seminar dinners,by the way, too,\nfor three years.So Simon is way ahead--one might say he was kind\nof a blockchain Bitcoinmaximalist three years ago.I think you've moved\nmore to the middle--you can self-declare\nwhere you are.And Simon, Johnson,\nand Nehan, Narula,and Michael, Casey,\nand I, are goingto be standing up a blockchain\nlab course in the spring.So Simon?Your question is, what do\nyou think about all this,and maybe for both of\nyou in the last minute,when are we going to see a true\ncentral bank test this out?I mean, there's nine of\nthem on this page thatare kind of feeling it out.SIMON JOHNSON: I don't think\nthere's any technical problemhere at all.I think Rob has clearly put\nthis out on a long time ago.I think the issue comes\ndown to what Rob said,what does it do to credit?Who really wants to\nfind out the hard way?And what does it\ndo-- what happensin a crisis when\neveryone-- you know,let's say you're\nnot paying intereston a digital central\nbank currency,and you can get interest\non your bank account,but there's a crisis.And you say, well, I\ndon't want to have this--be holding the liability\nof a private bank anymore,I want to be holding the\nliability of the central bank.Doesn't everyone run\nto the central bank?And what does that do to credit?And how you're going\nto figure this out,without actually running\nsomething like on [INAUDIBLE]..GARY GENSLER: And\ntwo predictions--how many years before\nour country actually--because 180 countries,\nnine of themare already bubbling around.Two of these-- Ecuador\nstopped, Uruguay maybe stopped,and the UK Royal\nMint might have beenstopped by its own government.But when do you\nthink we're going", "start": 4680.0, "heat": 0.106}, {"text": "to see a country actually\nhave a direct digital accountto their

early\n[INAUDIBLE] years,within two years,\nat least, possibly.GARY GENSLER: So back\ntogether on Thursday.We're going to dig\nback into these nine,and talk a little bit\nmore about the moneyflower
