have something\nto do with thinking.So let's start up here, a\ndefinition of artificialintelligence, by saying that\nit's about thinking,whatever that is.My definition of artificial\nintelligence hasto be rather broad.So we're going to say it's\nnot only about thinking.It's also about perception,\nand it's about action.And if this were a philosophy\nclass, then I'd stop rightthere and just say, in this\nsubject we're going to talkabout problems involving\nthinking,perception, and action.But this is not a philosophy\nclass.This a Course six class.It's an engineering\nschool class.It's an MIT class.So we need more than that.And therefore we're going to\ntalk about models that aretargeted at thinking,\nperception, and action.And this should not be strange\nto you, because model makingis what MIT is about.You run into someone at a bar,\nor relative asks you what youdo at MIT, the right knee jerk\nreaction is to say, we learnedhow to build models.That's what we do at MIT.We build the models using\ndifferential equations.We build models using\nprobabilities.We build models using physical\nand computational simulations.Whatever we do, we\nbuild models.Even in humanities class,

smarter.Because you'll have better\nmodels of your own thinking,not just the subject matter of\nthe subject, but better modelsof your own thinking.So models targeted at thinking,perception, and action.We know that's not quite enough,\nbecause in order tohave a model, you have to\nhave representation.So let's say that artificial\nintelligence is aboutrepresentations that support\nthe making of models tofacilitate an understanding\nof thinking,perception, and action.Now you might say to me, well\nwhat's a representation?And what good can it do?So I'd like to take a brief\nmoment to tell you aboutgyroscopes.Many of you have friends in\nmechanical engineering.One of the best ways embarrass\nthem is to say here's abicycle wheel.And if I spin it, and blow hard\non it right here, on theedge of the wheel, is\ngoing to turn overthis way or this way?I guarantee that what they will\ndo is they'll put theirhand in an arthritic posture\ncalled the right hand screwrule, aptly named because people\nwho use it tend to getthe right answer about\n50% of the time.But we're never going to make\nthat mistake again.Because we're electrical\nengineers,not mechanical engineers.And we know about\nrepresentation.What we're going to do is we're\ngoing to think about ita little bit.And we're going to use some\nduct tape to help us thinkabout just one piece\nof the wheel.So I want you to

feeling.Try it.We need a demonstration.I don't anybody think that\nI'm cheating, here.So let's just twist it\none way or the other.So that's powerful\npull, isn't it.Alex is now never going to get\nthe gyroscope wrong, becausehe's got the right\nrepresentation.So much of what you're going to\naccumulate in this subjectis a suite of representations\nthat will help you to buildprograms that are intelligent.But I want to give you a second\nexample, one a littlebit more computational.But one of which was very\nfamiliar to you by the timeyou went to first grade,\nin most cases.It's the problem of the farmer,\nthe fox, the goose,and the grain.There's a river, a leaky rowboat\nthat can only carrythe farmer, and one of\nhis four possessions.So what's the rightrepresentation for this problem?It might be a picture\nof the farmer.It might be a poem about the\nsituation, perhaps a haiku.We know that those are not\nthe right representation.Somehow, we get the sense that\nthe right representation mostinvolve something about the\nlocation of the participantsin this scenario.So we might draw a picture\nthat looks like this.There's the scenario, and\nhere in glorious

were a little kid.How many such situations\nare there?What do you think, Tanya?It looks to me like all four of\nindividuals can be on oneside or the other.So for every position the farmer\ncan be, each of theother things can be on either\nside of the river.So it would be two to the fourth\nshe says aggressivelyand without hesitation.Yes, two to the fourth,\n16 possibilities.So we could actually draw\nout the entire graph.It's small enough.There's another position over\nhere with the farmer, fox,goose, and grain.And in fact that's\nthe one we want.And if we draw out the entire\ngraph, it looks like this.This is a graph of the\nsituations and the allowedconnections between them.Why are there not 16?Because the other--how many have I got?Four?10?The others are situations in\nwhich

out\nhow many customers you getfor the number of advertisements\nyou place inthe newspaper.So artificial intelligence is\nabout constraints exposed byrepresentations that support\nmodels targeted to thinking--actually there's one\nmore thing, too.Not quite done.Because after all, in the end,\nwe have to build programs.So it's about algorithms enabled\nby constraints exposedby representations that model\ntargeted thinking, perception,and action.So these algorithms, or we might\ncall them just as wellprocedures, or we might call\nthem just as well methods,whatever you like.These are the stuff of what\nartificial intelligence isabout-- methods, algorithms,\nrepresentations.I'd like to give you\none more example.It's something we call, in\nartificial intelligence,generated test.And it's such a simple idea,\nyou'll never hear it again inthis subject.But it's an idea you need to\nadd to your repertoire ofproblem solving methods,\ntechniques, procedures, andalgorithms.So here's how it works.Maybe I can explain to best by\nstarting off with an example.Here's a tree leaf I picked\noff a tree onthe way over to class.I hope it's not the last\nof the species.What is it, what kind of tree?", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.175}, {"text": "I don't know.I never did learn my trees,\nor my colors, or mymultiplication tables.So I have to go back to this\nbook, the Audubon SocietyField Guide

a\nsycamore, or something.MIT's full of them.So when I do that, I do\nsomething very intuitive, verynatural, something you\ndo all the time.But we're going to\ngive it a name.We're going to call

once in a while we\nget something that succeedsand pleases us.That's what I did\nwith the leaf.But now you have\na name for it.Once you have a name\nfor something, youget power over it.You can start to\ntalk about it.So I can say, if you're doing\na generate and test approachto a problem, you better build\na generator with certainproperties that make\ngenerators good.For example, they should\nnot be redundant.They shouldn't give you the\nsame solution twice.They should be informable.They should be able to absorb\ninformation such as, this is adeciduous tree.Don't bother looking\nat the conifers.So once you have a name for\nsomething, you can starttalking about.And that vocabulary\ngives you power.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.202}, {"text": "So we call this the\nRumpelstiltskin

role, as I see it,\nin giving these lectures.Recitations are four buttressing\nand expanding onthe material, and providing a\nvenue that's small enough fordiscussion.Mega recitations are\n[? a usual

me,\nwell, do I reallyneed to go to class?I like to say that the answer\nis, only if you like to passthe subject.But you are MIT students.And MIT people always like\nto look at the data.So this is a scattergram we\nmade after the subject wastaught last fall, which shows\nthe relationship betweenattendance at lectures and the\ngrades awarded in the course.And if you're not sure what\nthat all means, here's theregression line.So that information is a\nlittle suspect for tworeasons, one of which is we\nasked people to self report onhow many lectures they thought\nthey attended.And our mechanism for assigning\nthese numericalgrades is a little weird.And there's a third thing, too,\nand that is, one mustnever confuse correlation\nwith cause.You can think of other\nexplanations for why thattrend line goes up, different\nfrom whether it has somethingto do with lectures producing\ngood grades.You might ask how I feel about\nthe people up there on theother upper left hand corner.There are one or two people who\nwere near the top of thesubject who didn't go\nto class at all.And I have mixed feelings\nabout that.You're adults.It's your call.On the other hand, I wish that\nif that's what you dohabitually in all the subjects\nyou take at MIT, that youwould resign and go somewhere\nelse, and let somebody elsetake their slot.Because you're not benefiting\nfrom the

quiz.Because that's when we get\nto use our blank stare.Because we have no idea\nwhat the class averageever is on any quiz.Here's what we do.Like everybody else, we\nstart off with a scorefrom zero to 100.But then we say to ourselves,\nwhat score would you get ifyou had a thorough understanding\nof the material?And we say, well, for this\nparticular exam, it's thisnumber right here.And what score would you\nget if you had a goodunderstanding of the material?That's that score.And what happens if you're\ndown here is that you'refollowing off the edge of the\nrange in which we think youneed to do more work.So what we do is, we say that if\nyou're in this range here--following MIT convention\nwith GPAs and stuff,that gets you a five.If you're in this range\ndown here, there's asharp drop off to four.If you're in this range\ndown here, there's asharp fall off to three.So that means if you're in the\nmiddle of one of thoseplateaus there's no point\nin arguing with this.Because it's not going\nto do you any good.We have these boundaries where\nwe think performance breakpoints are.So you say, well that seems\na little harsh.Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\nand start arguing.But then we
