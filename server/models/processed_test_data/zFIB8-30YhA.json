Friday.On Friday, you learned about how\nsupply and demand interactto yield equilibrium.So the sort of fundamental\nconcepts we talked about withAdam Smith and his water-diamond\nparadox ofsupply and demand interacting\nto yield amarket price and quantity.And the way we're going to build\non your understanding ofthis today is talk about what\nhappens when you shock thatsupply and demand equilibrium.When things change, how does\nthat change that supply anddemand equilibrium?And that'll help build yourunderstanding of what you learned.So to review, let's go to our\nbasic supply and demand graph,Figure 2-1 in the handout.You talked in section about\nthe market for pork.That's the market\nPerloff uses.Seems good as any, so we'll\ncontinue to rely on that, themarket for pork.And in this pork market, you\nhave a demand curve and asupply curve.Now, it's critical to remember\nwhat these curves represent.Once again, for this course,\nideally, you understand allconcepts on three levels,\nintuitively, graphically, andmathematically.But the intuitive is the most\nimportant, especially forthose of you who aren't going\nto go on and do awhole lot of economics.For instance, where it's just\none of the few economicscourses you'll take, it's very\nimportant for your lives andusing economics you understand\nthis intuitively.So intuitively, let's talk about\nwhat the demand curverepresents.Can anyone tell me, what's the\ndemand curve represent, fromwhat you learned on Friday?", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.305}, {"text": "Can anyone just take a shot?We're just--yeah, go ahead.AUDIENCE: The willingness\nof consumers tobuy a certain product.PROFESSOR: Exactly.The willingness of consumers--I'm going to change your words\njust a bit, because words areimportant here.The willingness of\nconsumers to pay.The willingness to pay.The difference with buy is\nit's really because thedifferent amounts.They're going to be willing\nto pay different amounts.So it's the willingness of\nconsumers to pay for the good.The willingness of consumers\nto pay for the good.So what this says is that each\npoint in the demand curverepresents the price consumers\nare willing topay for that quantity.And it's downward sloping.The demand curve is downward\nsloping because as the pricegoes up, consumers are willing\nto buy less of a good.So their willingness\nto pay changes.So that's the demand curve.Now what about supply curve?What's a supply curve\nrepresent?Anyone?Yeah?AUDIENCE: Pretty much\nthe opposite.The willingness of producers\nto produce, like, how muchthey are going to charge for--PROFESSOR: Yeah, the willingness\nof producers tosupply the good.So how much they're going\nto charge for a givenquantity of the good.And once again, that is upward\nsloping because as the pricerises, they're willing\nto supply more.So as the price rises, consumers\ndemand less.As the price rises, producers\nproduce more.And equilibrium is that point\nwhere supply equals demand.Equilibrium equals happiness.It's the point where suppliers\nand demanders are both happy.They're both happy because at a\npoint such as e, the amountthat consumers demand at that\nprice is equal to the amount", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.559}, {"text": "suppliers are willing to\nsupply at that price.So jointly happy.You've reached a point where\nconsumers want a certainamount at a certain price.At that price, producers say,\ngreat, you want e, I'm happyto produce e at that price.So we've reached equilibrium.Now, let's talk about what\nhappens when we shock thatequilibrium.This is the market for pork.Imagine that the price\nof beef rises.The price of beef rises.Can anyone give me a guess as\nto what that does to themarket for pork?The price of beef rises.What does that do to the\nmarket for pork.Yeah.AUDIENCE: It reduces\nthe demand.PROFESSOR: It what?AUDIENCE: Reduces the demand.PROFESSOR: Why would it reduce\nthe demand for pork?AUDIENCE: Because the\nprice [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: But I didn't say\nthe price of pork rises.The price of beef rises.And how does beef\nrelate to pork?AUDIENCE: They're substitutes.PROFESSOR: They're\nsubstitutes.Exactly.So when the price of beef\nprices, how does that affectpeople's demand for pork?Increases it.Exactly.Because they're substitutes.What we're going to learn\ncritically as we go through iswhat's going to determine\nthese demand curvesimportantly is going to be\nsubstitutability across goods.So here we have a situation\nwhere the substitute for porkhas gotten more expensive.As a result, people\nwant more pork.That is a shift out in the\ndemand curve, or a shift up inthe demand curve.A shift up or out, depending on\nit's out into space or upvertically in the\ndemand curve.So what happens here is that\nfolks shift to consuming pork,so they want more of it.So we're initial equilibrium--we just made up some numbers--we're initial equilibrium here\nat 220 millions of kilogramsof pork a year and a price\nof $3 a kilogram.That was the initial\nequilibrium.That was the point where\ndemanders andsuppliers were happy.Now the price of beef has\ngone up, maybe because--", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.601}, {"text": "I don't know.Mad cow disease or something\nlike that has raisedthe price of beef.So now people are saying,\nhey, we want more pork.That shifts the demand\ncurve out.Initially, if the price stayed\nat $3, if the price remainedat $3, what would happen?What would happen is people\nwould now-- and once again,these numbers are made up.But this is just to illustrate\nan example.People would now say, gee, at a\nprice of $3 and this furtherout demand curve-- now I'm on\nFigure 2-2, if you haven'tpicked that up--I want 232 millions of kilograms\nof pork a year--not I, personally.That'd be like Homer.Everybody wants 232 millions of\nkilograms of pork a year.I hope you guys don't get tired\nof Simpsons references.So what that says is consumers\nsay, gee, I want a lot morepork at that price.If it's going to be $3, and the\nprice of beef just wentup, I'm going to want\na lot more pork.So what you're going to have\ninitially is excess demand,because at that price of $3,\nsuppliers are only willing tosupply 220 million kilograms.\nThey were happy, right?They were happy at point e1.When you come along, and you say\nconsumers now want more,they say, well, we're\nnot happy to providemore at that price.If you want more, we're\ngoing to have tocharge a higher price.So they say, if you want more\npork, we're going to have toproduce more.So we are going to slide\nup the supply curve.So if you start at a point like\ne1, they say, gee, youwant more pork?Well, we're going to have to\nslide up that supply curve.So we're moving up the supply\ncurve and saying, we're goingto have to charge you a higher\nprice if you want more.Well, as the price goes\nup, consumers say,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.621}, {"text": "well, wait a second.If the price is going up, I\ndon't want quite as much more.And you meet at the new\nequilibrium e2.So what happens is producers\nsay, gee, if you want more,I'm going to charge you\na higher price.Consumers say, well, gee, if\nyou're charging a higherprice, I'm going to go back\nup the demand curve.I don't quite want as much\nat that higher price.And the new equilibrium is e2.That's where consumers and\nproducers are now happier withthat outward shift\nin demand curve.But the key point is consumers\nare not getting as much asthey originally wanted at the\noriginal price, because theoriginal price will not hold.The price is going to change.Given the price is going\nto change, thequantity is going to change.And you end up with both a\nhigher price and a higherquantity for pork.So think about it.This is pretty interesting.The price of beef rising raised\nthe price of pork.It didn't just increase the\ndemand for pork, but throughincreasing the demand,\nit raised the price.So price in one market affects\nthe price in another market,not just the quantity but the\nprice in another market.And that's our new\nequilibrium.That's the shift in\nthe demand curve.And once again, suppliers\nand demanders are happy.They're happy at this new\npoint e2, this newequilibrium, because given the\nnew demand curve, at a priceof $3.50 a kilogram, producers\nare happy to produce the 228million kilograms of pork a\nyear that consumers want.And at that price, that's\nwhat consumers want.If they're going to say, oh,\nit's $3.50, I want about 228.I want more than I wanted\nbefore, because beef's gottenmore expensive, but not as much\nas I would have wanted ifyou hadn't increased\nyour price.And that's the new equilibrium\nis e2.Yeah.AUDIENCE: But is it possible\nthat changing the price ofpork could affect the\nprice of beef?PROFESSOR: Excellent.So the question is, could there\nbe a feedback effectwhere, basically, now the pork\nmarket's changed, could thatgo back and affect\nthe beef market?In principle, yes.In practice, we're going\nto make your lifeeasy by saying no.In principle, it could.And that gets into something\ncalled \"general equilibrium.\"", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.725}, {"text": "And that's way too complicated\nfor this course, so we aregoing to ignore those kinds of\nfeedback effects for now.That's something you can learn\nabout more in future courses.But you're right.In principle, it could affect\nthe demand for everything.You could imagine that as the\nprice of beef goes up, thatmeans that, for example,\nthe cost ofrestaurant meals goes up.So I'm not going to eat at the\nrestaurant as much, so maybeI'll go to the movies more.So in principle, the price of\nbeef going up could raise thedemand for movies.It's crazy.It's hard to know\nwhere to stop.So we're going to make your life\neasy by stopping at onelevel here.But you're right.In principle, there could be\nthese wide range of feedbacks.And once again, I talked in\nthe first lecture aboutsimplifying assumptions.We're going to try to teach you\nthe basic concepts but tryto make simplifying assumptions\nthat make it moremanageable.That's the kind of simplifying\nassumption we'll make for ourmodeling here in this course.So that's a shift in\nthe demand curve.Yeah.AUDIENCE: How do you\nquantify the shiftsin the demand curve?PROFESSOR: Excellent.And that will be exactly--basically, the way we're going\nto learn in this course, we'regoing to do things a\ncouple of times.When we talk about producer\ntheory, we will teach youwhere this supply curve\ncomes from.Basically, firm\nprofit-maximizing decisionswill determine the supply curve\nand how much it shifts,and we'll teach you that when we\nteach you producer theory.So this is sort of\na big overview.You're good MIT students.You're immediately thinking,\nwhere the hell do these demandand supply curves come from?That's where we're\ngoing to get to.That's the whole point of\nconsumer theory will give usthe demand curve.Producer theory will give\nus the supply curve.All right.Good questions.So now, let's talk about\na different case.Let's talk about a shift\nin the supply curve.So now, let's suppose\nthere's a drought.And let's suppose it's\na drought thatonly affects pork.Because if the drought affected\nbeef, that would thenhave these other feedback\neffects.Let's imagine there's\na pork drought.I don't know what that\nwould mean, but let'simagine that happened.So suddenly, it becomes\nmore expensive--or let's just say there's\nmad pig disease.Let's imagine there's\nmad pig disease.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.812}, {"text": "So suddenly, it becomes more\nexpensive to produce pork.Because there's fewer\npigs, it's moreexpensive to produce it.So what that would do is that\nwould cause a shift in in thesupply curve-- inward or upward\nof the supply curve.Suddenly, on you get the fact\nthat given that it's moreexpensive to produce pork,\nsuppliers say, well gee, toproduce a given amount of pork,\nI need to get paid ahigher price.So we get, once again,\ninitially, if the price stayedconstant-- so now I'm\non Figure 2-3.If the price stayed constant,\nwe would notbegin with excess demand.Because if the price stayed\nconstant, then consumers wouldwant 220 million kilograms of\npork, which is what theywanted before.Nothing's changed from\ntheir perspective.But producers would say, look,\nat that price, I can only nowproduce 205, because my supply\ncurve shifted up.So once again, you have to\nmove to a new equilibriumwhere suppliers and consumers\nare happy.That will happen at\na point like e2.Because at e2, given the higher\nprice of producingpork, producers will now say,\nOK, I'm happy to sell 215million kilograms at $3.55.And consumers will say, well\ngee, at $3.55, I don't wantquite as much as I\nwanted before.I only want 215.And they're happy.Here's what's striking.We had two very different\nphenomena.We had a demand shift\nand a supply shift.Both led to the same outcome.I'm sorry, both led\nto a higher price.Sorry, not the same outcome.Both led to a higher price.One led to higher demand,\nto higherquantity sold in the market.So you go back to Figure 2-2.The price went up, and the\nquantity in the market went upfrom 220 to 228.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.918}, {"text": "In Figure 2-3, when the supply\nshift happened, the price alsowent up almost exactly\nthe same amount.But here, the quantity fell.So you can't tell from a price\nincrease what happened.If the price of pork goes up,\nyou can't tell me whether thatwas a demand or supply shift.You need to know both the price\nand quantity to be ableto tell me that.Both changes led to the same\noutcome in terms of prices.Questions about that?Now let's make it interesting.So we have the supply and\ndemand equilibrium.Supply shifts, demand shifts,\nyou move the points.You guys can all do it\ngraphically, even if you don'tquite get it intuitively yet.Now let's ask, what happens if\nthe government comes in andmesses this up?Now, step aside to\nmy other hat.The other course I teach is\ncalled Public Economics, whichis all about the role of the\ngovernment in the economy.In this course, most of what\nyou'll learn is there's aclear role of the government\nin the economy.It's to screw it up.Economics is fundamentally\na right-wing science.Most of my colleagues are\nDemocrats, but that doesn'tchange the fact that what we\nteach is fundamentally veryconservative, which is the\nmarket knows best, andgovernments just\nmess things up.Now, later in the semester,\nwe'll talk about why thatmight not be true.And the whole point of my other\ncourse, 14.41, is totalk about why that might not be\ntrue and where governmentscan make things worse\nand better.But from your basic perspective,\nyou need to beindoctrinated with this\nfundamental position, that themarket gets it right.The market equilibrates.Governments mess things up.And that's sort of where\nwe'll start.So let's talk about the classic\nexample of governmentmessing things up,\nthe minimum wage.You've all heard of the minimum\nwage, the thingworkers get paid more.That seems like a good thing.Well, in fact, to economists,\nit's a bad thing.And let's talk about why.To many economists, at\nleast this initialanalysis is a bad thing.We'll come back later as to why\nit might not be so bad.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.745}, {"text": "To do that, let's talk about\nequilibrium not in a marketfor goods, like pork,\nbut in a market forinputs, which is labor.Labor is an input to the\nproduction process.We'll talk about this at great\nlength later in the semester.But the key thing is, just like\nthere's a market for porkwhere the equilibrium outcome is\nthe price you pay for porkand the amount of pork sold,\nthere's a market for labor.And in that market, things\nare flipped.Who are the consumers now?Well, they're the firms.\nThe firms demand labor.Who are suppliers now?Well, they're you.They're the people.People supply labor.So now we've flipped\nthings on its head.The suppliers are the people.The demanders are the firms. But\nthe analysis is the same.This basic supply and demand\nframework, which will turn outto be so powerful this semester,\ncan be used, eventhough we flipped the labels\nof who's on what side.So you see in Figure 2.4, we\nhave a labor market with anupward-sloping supply curve.What does that mean?Why is the supply curve\nupward-sloping?Because the higher your\nwage, the moreyou're willing to work.And we have a downward-sloping\ndemand curve.Why is it downward sloping?Because the higher the wage,\nthe fewer workers the firmwants to hire.It would rather use\nmachines instead.So basically, you've got that\nsame supply and demand curve,different stories as to where\nthey come from, but the sameeffect in terms of determining\nequilibrium.We get an equilibrium at w1 l*,\nwhich is at a wage w1, l*workers are willing to work.Or l* hours are supplied\nof labor.We think about hours\nsupplied, notnecessarily number of workers.l* hours of labor\nare supplied.And at that w1, l* workers are\nwilling to provide l* hours,and at that w1, firms demand\nl* hours, and that's theequilibrium.Same analysis as before, just\ndifferent stories as to what'sbehind the curve.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.518}, {"text": "Now, let's say the government\nrolled in and set, as inFigure 2-5, a minimum wage.The government says, look,\nthat wage w1 is too low--or w* in this graph--\nis too low.Workers are not paid enough\nin equilibrium.We need to make sure that they\nget paid a minimum amount.So we are going to mandate that\nworkers cannot be paidbelow w lower bar, which\nis critically above w*.Well, what happens\nin that case?Well, in that case, at that\nwage, workers are thrilled.They say, look at that wage.We are delighted to work--god, the numbers are--I'm getting old--ls hours.I have my prescription\nfor my bifocals.I've had it for, like, two\nmonths, and I just can't quitetake it to the mall\nand get them.So eventually I'll get them.I just can't quite admit\nI'm that old.So workers are like, great.At that wage, we'll supply\nl sub s hours.That sounds great to us.We're all good.But the firm says,\nwait a second.No, we don't want to hire l\nsub s hours at that wage.That's way too high.We only want to hire at that\nhigh wage l sub d hours.So suddenly, here you have\na case of excess supply.Not excess demand,\nexcess supply.Workers want to supply more\nhours than firms want to hire.Now, in our previous example,\nwhat would happen?What would happen is, if there's\nexcess supply-- well,let me ask you.If there's excess supply in\nthe market, how would themarket equilibrate?What would happen?Yeah.AUDIENCE: It would lower\nthe price so that the--PROFESSOR: In this case,\nthe price is what?AUDIENCE: The number of--PROFESSOR: The wage.The wage.So exactly.In our previous example,\nthe wage would fall.Workers would suck it up\nand get a lower wage.Firms would be happy to\npay a lower wage.You'd reach a point where\nthey were happy.You'd reach a point like e.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.534}, {"text": "But you can't now.You can't, because the\ngovernment said you can't payless than w lower bar.So you end up with\nexcess supply.And we call

end up not in equilibrium\nbut disequilibrium.Now, disequilibrium is kind of\nhard to think about, becausein some sense, this course\nis all about equilibrium.So I'm not talking about chaos\nor cats and dogs livingtogether, breakdown\nof social order.That's not what I'm\ntalking about.Disequilibrium, there is\nstill a market outcome.The market still settles\nat a point.In this case, what happens

ofquantity and prices\nis determined bythe constrained party.That's the way I like\nto think about.You can think about it\nhowever you want.But here's the point.Workers can't work if firms\nwon't hire

lower\nbar was set below w*?What if I'd redrawn this\ndiagram so w lowerbar was below w*?Yeah.AUDIENCE: The market would\nequilibrate and--PROFESSOR: Yeah, nothing would\nhappen at the end of the day.And here's the key point--very important point\nto remember--which is that markets are very\nrobust. Economic markets arevery robust. And if they can\nundo the effective governmentintervention, they will.So if the government tries to\ncome and intervene in a waywhich markets can undo and get\nback to where they wanted tobe, they will.That original point e is where\nthe market wants to be.That was where it was happy.It can't get there in the\nexample I taught here with wlower bar above w*.But if w lower bar was below w*,\nit could get there and behappy, so government\nintervention would make nodifference.That's one example of a\ngovernment intervention.Let's do another example.Then I want to talk about the\npros and cons of thesegovernment interventions.Let's do another example.Gas price ceilings.So let's consider a cap on how\nmuch can be charged for gas.Seems a pretty sensible\npolicy.Gas is crazy expensive.We all like to drive.So let's consider a cap\non the price of gas.Imagine, for example, we're\ninitially in equilibrium, inFigure 2-6, with demand of\nQ2 and a price of P1.We're all happy.Now let's imagine there's an oil\ncrisis, because, say, oilcompanies decide it's a good\nidea to drill eight milesunderground, and everything\nexplodes, and we suddenly runout of oil.So all of a sudden, there's a\nconstraint in the supply.Suddenly, there's a--I'm sorry, my bad.We're initially in equilibrium\nat e1.My bad.We're initially at equilibrium\nat e1, with a price of P1.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.6}, {"text": "There's a bit of mislabeling\nhere.On the vertical axis, that\nupper price should be P2.So on the vertical axis, you see\nthere's P1 equals P. Thenabove it, it says P1 again.That should say P2.So we're initially in\nequilibrium at point e1 with aprice of P1 and a\nquantity of Q1.Now oil tanks blow up\nall over the world.Suddenly, that means there's\na restriction inthe supply of gas.Suddenly, there's not as much\ngas as can be produced.So that's an upward shift in the\nsupply curve, just like wetalked about before.And absent any government\nintervention, the supply curvewould shift up to s2, consumers\nwould want less gas,and you'd reach a new\nequilibrium at e2.And once again, let's talk about\nequilibrium as beingwhere people are happy.Now, you could say, well gee,\npeople aren't happy paying ahigher price for gas.Well, that's why I'm a bit glib\nusing the term \"happy.\"It's a point where the suppliers\nand demanders arejointly willing to\nmake the deal.And they're willing to\nmake the deal at e2.They're willing to say, look,\ngiven how many oil rigs haveblown up, we are happy to\nequilibrate the market now ata higher price and\na lower quantity.But then it's September, 2010.There's an election\ntwo months away.President Obama isn't very\nhappy about this.And he says, forget it.We're going to cap the price at\nP.

And youend up with disequilibrium.And in this case, once again,\nthe amount sold is what theproducers are willing to sell.It doesn't matter how much\nconsumers want if producersaren't willing to sell it.You end up with disequilibrium,\nand you end upwith much, much less\ngas being sold.So yeah, the price stays low,\nbut the amount of gas beingsold is much lower than if\nthe president allowedthe price to rise.So that's another example of\na government interventioncausing disequilibrium.Any questions about that?Yeah.AUDIENCE: In the last chapter,\nwe talked about, can thegovernment then come in and\ngive a subsidy to the oilproducers to produce\nthe same amount?PROFESSOR: Great.Hold that thought for 14.41.But that's exactly what the\ngovernment could do.The government has\nlots of tools.So it can come in and say, well,\non the one hand, we'llset a price cap.But then we'll come in on the\nother hand and give a subsidyto oil producers to make\nsure they do that.That has two problems. One is,\nnot so good with the voters.Like, gee, we're going to give\nsubsidies to oil companies.Isn't that a great idea.Two is, you've got to raise the\nmoney somehow, which meansyou've got to raise taxes.Also not so good with\nthe voters.So it's, in general, not a good\nidea, because you screwit up on the one hand\nto screw up again.Two wrongs don't make a right,\nsomething I learnedfrom an early age.If the government's messed up\nthe market on the one hand,it's not, generally, a good idea\nto try to mess with itagain to fix that.But that's exactly the kind of\nstuff we'll discuss in 14.41.AUDIENCE: I've got a question\nabout that.Will that mean that there's\na [INAUDIBLE] because", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.807}, {"text": "[INAUDIBLE]?PROFESSOR: Great segue into\nwhat I want to

by and large.Why do governments do\nthings like this?What are the costs\nand benefits?Now, later in the semester,\nwe'll talkabout welfare economics.By welfare, welfare\nhas two meanings.We often think of welfare as\nbeing money distributed topoor people.That's one meaning.But when we say \"welfare\neconomics,\" we actually meanthe well-being of society.And we'll talk about the\nwell-being of society later onin the semester.But let's talk for a minute\nabout this general topic.And how do we think about the\nkind of welfare economics ofthese restrictions?Well, there's two costs and\none benefit to theserestrictions.The first cost is the\nefficiency loss.So the costs of things like the\nminimum wage and gas priceceilings, the first cost\nis the efficiency loss.And we are going to be\nmuch more precise.This lecture is sort of a chance\nto be loosey-gooseyabout things that I'll then\nmake much more precisethroughout the semester.We'll be precise about\nwhat we mean by thisthroughout the semester.But the key point is, in\neconomics, whenever there is atrade that can be made that\nmakes both parties better off,and it is not made, that\nis an inefficiency.So in economics, we define\n\"efficient\" as when all tradesthat can make both parties\nbetter off are made.And whenever anything comes\nup that interferes--so a trade that could\nmake both partiesbetter

to wait at\na gas pump, but pretty much,you drive up, you get your gas,\nyou leave.

peoplewaiting in line for gas?Yeah.AUDIENCE: Because they\ncould be workingor doing other things.PROFESSOR: They could\nbe working.They could be out making trades\nthat make everybodybetter

about this?PROFESSOR: Yeah, believe\nme, they did.But they said, well gee, we\ncan't let people pay thosehigh prices.Governments face really\nhard decisions likethis all the time.There's another program, of\ncourse, which is, what happenswith people waiting\nin line for gas?They're idling and\nusing up gas.So in fact, there was a direct\nmechanical inefficiency aswell, which is all the gas

this?Everyone saw the direct effect,\nwhich was low prices,and indirect effect, which\nwas long lines.With a minimum wage, it's\nharder, because there's lotsof reasons for unemployment,\nnot just the minimum wage.So the indirect effect is\na lot harder to see.If you're a politician, you're\nsaying, look, I'll raise theminimum wage.I'll make sure you're\npaid more.Everybody goes, yay.And then the
