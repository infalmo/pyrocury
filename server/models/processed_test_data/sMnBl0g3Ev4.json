doing public\npolicy today, had to looka little official.So let's talk a little\nbit about public policyand some of the challenges\nthat we're going to do.And the overview of today--we're going to chat a little bit\nabout the readings, of course.And then I want to set it up\na bit on crypto finance, justa simple term of this $200\nor $250 billion dollar space,because a lot of the public\npolicy is about crypto finance,though there are some public\npolicy about underlyingblockchain technology.It's both, but most of it's\nabout the financial marketsaround cryptocurrencies\nand crypto tokens.Give an overall public\npolicy framework,talk about the three\nguardrails, the big railsof illicit activity, financial\nstability, and the public.And then I'm going\nto share a little bitof some slides and some thoughts\non public policy development.As many of you know,\nI've spent the last 20years kicking around\npolitics and public policy.And as two or three of you know,\nin this spring, Simon Johnsonand I stood up a course\ncalled Public Policyand the Private Sector.So it's maybe my little\nadvertisement for next spring,because we're going to\nstand it up again as well.So the study questions which was\nbasically around public policy,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "as you remember these questions.And I'm sorry, because Talita\ndidn't give me my friendly listas to who hasn't spoken up yet.So that's Talita.So you're saved, you're\nsaved, because now I can'tremember anybody that's not--AUDIENCE: I can send\nit to a printer.GARY GENSLER: What's that?AUDIENCE: I can send\nit to a printer.GARY GENSLER: Yeah, you\ncan send it to a printer.It's hard to remember with\n85 registered studentsas to who hasn't spoken\nand who has spoken.But you're all\ngoing, here now, he'sgoing to do cold calling now.But the main study questions\nthat we're going throughare basically around the\npublic policy frameworkand how it relates to\nblockchain technology.But Catalina, what did you\ntake from the readings?AUDIENCE: What I took\nfrom the readingsis that for blockchain\nto further develop,it has to be embedded\nin the regulatory systemand in the policy system.In that way, for example,\ninvestors will be better off.They will have\nprotections, they willfeel better because they will\nhave some degree of certaintythat someone is\ntaking care of them.GARY GENSLER: And so\nCatalina is sayingshe took from the readings\nthat for further adoption,investor protection, and the\nconfidence in the marketsare important.Lauren, did I see that you're--AUDIENCE: Sorry, yeah.So I was going to say--I mean, one of the\nreadings was a little bitthe opposite of this.But to build on that, the\nmention of regulationsand validating\nblockchain a little bitwill help the players that\nare already in the marketsexplore in that space, just\nbecause they tend to bea little more risk averse.So they haven't really\ndabbled in startups and thingsthat have the advantage.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "GARY GENSLER: So in\nessence, that some peoplewere risk averse, the incumbents\nare a bit risk averse.And why would incumbent,\nbig-- oh, this is my fun list.It's not

interesting.So you mean there's\nno David Martin here.Right here.Oh.AUDIENCE: So to\nyour first question,this relates to the current\npublic policy frameworksin my mind in two ways.One, this technology\nsits, in some ways,in gaps in the current\nregulatory framework.It's not clear, for\nexample, that the CFTC--because this could\nbe a commodity--has as broad regulatory\nauthority as the SECdoes, for example, with respect\nto the securities markets.It's in a gap.But the second thing is, even\nif those gaps were closed,for certain kinds of\nblockchain technology,the anonymity and secrecy of\nit just prevents regulationalmost entirely.So there's two things.There's a gap question, and then\nthere's the impact of secrecy", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and whether regulation\ncan find it.GARY GENSLER: All right.So there's a gap because\nof the technology.But are there other gaps also--and your first name is?AUDIENCE: James.GARY GENSLER: Jim.AUDIENCE: James, yeah.So I think that another problem\nwith regulating blockchaintechnology in general is because\nthe lack of intermediaries.The way that traditional\nregulation worksis that they try to have more\nclose access to intermediaries,so that they can control\nthe intermediaries.But now, there's\nno intermediary.So it's very hard\nfor you to control.GARY GENSLER: So\nwhat James is raisingis there might be a whole change\nin this ecosystem, a little bitof the business model that\nthere's fewer intermediaries.And a lot of\nregulation, whether thatbe tax, or investor\nprotection, or evenaround illicit activity,\ncenters around intermediaries.Why do you think it is\nthat so much of the lawcenters around intermediaries?It wasn't specific\nin the readings.But just why do you\nthink that that--Isabella?AUDIENCE: Well, I would\nassume that if intermediariesare going to be eliminated\nby this technology,then a lot of those\nplayers would not reallywant this technology\nto be pushed forward.So that's--GARY GENSLER: All\nright, so Isabella'sraising a point that\nmaybe intermediaries wouldbe threatened about\nthis technology.But I'm also asking, why do you\nthink the law historically--Adian?Why the law has attached\nrequirements on intermediaries.AUDIENCE: I think\nit's just easierto manage a group of\nintermediaries thatare regulated by law,\nso you can actuallylook at the\ntransactions that happenat the intermediary level.GARY GENSLER: So\nAdian's saying--and in the red\njersey in the back,I can't remember your name.Dan.AUDIENCE: So I just think that\nif any of these intermediaries", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "experience something\nthat caused them to fail,then you're bringing\ndown a lot morethan just that institution.GARY GENSLER: So two ideas.One is this\nattachment point thathas some leverage\nto it in the system.You can exert some\npublic policy influence.And one is that there\nmight be a point of failureand you need to protect\nthe system from failure.Other reasons back here?AUDIENCE: The\ngovernment just doesn'thave the manpower or the\nresources to look at everyone.And these\nintermediaries actuallymake money by\ncollecting this data.And so the government\ncan just use that.GARY GENSLER: So Jake's\nraising a variationof the force multiplying.It's not only a node to apply,\nbut they have the resources.So you're tapping into\nJP Morgan's back office,so to speak.And back here, I'll take.Sorry, your first name?AUDIENCE: Adam.GARY GENSLER: Adam.AUDIENCE: So the\nintermediaries are also--they're a mechanism for trust to\nallow trading between parties.So the regulation then would\nbe placed in like a consumerprotection role to ensure\nthat those intermediaries aresomeone to trust.GARY GENSLER: So it's for\na collection of reasonsthat public policy\nofficials around the globeoften attach requirements\nto intermediaries,because it's a node to get\nit done, it's a resource,they have deep\npockets sometimes.Sometimes, it's because\nthey might fail.And one thing that\nwasn't mentionedis sometimes\nactually institutionswant to be regulated over time,\nbecause it creates barriersto entry.It's usually not\nin an early stage.But later on, it's actually\nthe incumbents that often--it creates some\nbarriers to entryand they collect\nsome economic rents.Hugo?AUDIENCE: You can see that\nstarting now with the OG'sin the crypto space, like\nCoinbase or like the Bittrex,", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "like the American\ninstitutions that startedtheir exchange early

DuckTest.It's use common sense, and\nthen answer the question.Oh my gosh, I assigned one of\nmy own writings as a reading.So we'll skip over that.So crypto, the world\nof crypto finance,you've seen this\nslide before, but it'sbeen quite volatile, about $220\nbillion in the last few days.And a little over\n50%, 54% is Bitcoinand the other big\ncurrencies right nowon market value, Ethereum,\nRipple, and the like.We'll talk a lot about\ninitial coin offerings.And are they securities\nor are they not?But I would note, in\nterms of market value,probably three\nquarters of this spacehas already been determined\nby the Securities and ExchangeCommission not to be a security.Bitcoin's 54%, Ether's about 15\npoints or something like that.So you're all of a sudden\nup to about 70 points,and then there's a bunch of\nother things that add up.So about three quarters\nof the market valueright now is what one might\ncall a cash, or a commodity,but not a security\nin this world.And that's just relevant for\nsome of the debates that go on.We talked about\nthis a little bit.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Like the lioness the\ncorner, incumbentsare starting to\neye

Yes?GARY GENSLER: Why do you think\nincumbents want to get in?AUDIENCE: It's a\nrisky transaction.From the viewpoint\n[INAUDIBLE] it'sdifficult to do\nthis crypto finance.GARY GENSLER: You said\nit's difficult to do?AUDIENCE: For incumbents.GARY GENSLER: Yeah,\nbut why did theywant to get into this space?Why do they want to\nbe in crypto finance?AUDIENCE: Part of it is\nthat it's highly volatile.And how do you make money\nlargely off of volatility?And then there's also\na lot of people--I think it's what, like 20\nmillion Coinbase accounts.GARY GENSLER: Right, right.So when I was at\nGoldman Sachs for years,we used to have a saying.Volatility is our friend.It's often not the friend of\nmany people in the markets.But if you're in\nthe world of financeor you're in the world of inter\nmediating risk and holdingrisks--so volatility is a form of risk.So volatility was\nalways our friend.It was also our\nfriend, because oftenif it was really\nvolatile, sometimes someof our competitors would not\nmanage that risk as well.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And they would\nlose market share,and we would gain market share.In fact, maybe they went\nout of business, too.But people like the volatility.Startups can beg for\nforgiveness afterwards.Incumbents feel more\noften, not always,that they need to\nask for permission.And so there's a little bit of\nan asymmetric reputational riskthat goes on business-wise.Now, once you're\nat a big incumbent,if you work for one\nof the big places,you'll feel that little bit\nmore constraint, a little bitmore compliance officers.You're more lawyered, you\nhave more accountants.But you should still\nhave the same values.I say this sincerely.Don't break the law.No, no, sincerely.But when you're at a\nstartup, you tend--there's always some ambiguity,\nand you take a little bitmore reputational risk.You tend to.So there's a bunch\nof incumbents thatare trying to get in the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange, Eurex,Intercontinental Exchange,\nwhich owns the New York StockExchange.We'll do a whole class\non what they're doingthere later in the semester.Fidelity, that's spending\nsignificant amountof money looking\nat it and others.So the framework that\nwe've talked about,about guarding against\nillicit activity, stability,and the investing public--I'm going to sort\nthrough each of these,but it's tax compliance.No government wants to\nshrink their tax base.Now, some governments\nwant to attract activitythat shrinks the other\njurisdiction's tax base,but it's not about shrinking\nyour own tax base usually.I mean, you might\nby law lower taxes,but you're not\nreally looking to--generally,\ngovernments don't wantto promote whatever the\ndefinition of illicit activity.We don't need to define\nthat in this class.It's a normative thing that\nhappens culture by culture,", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "jurisdiction by jurisdiction.But there tends to be\nsomething that's prohibited--drug running, for instance,\nchild trafficking.I mean, there are certain\nthings that are broadlydefined as illicit,\nand then there'ssome that changes depending\nupon the culture and the societyand the times we're living in.Terrorism financing, clearly.And then sanctions, it's\na tool of foreign policythat countries like our own,\nbut Europe and elsewhereoften use sanctions to try to--it's centuries old.It's called blockades in an\nearlier century with the ships.But now, we do it\nmore electronicallyand commercially.Financial stability tends\nto be about the stabilityof the overall economy\nor the Fiat currency.Or I put a little\nsecond picture there,the stability of the\ncommercial banking system.So financial stability can\nmean a lot of different things,but it's usually about\nthe currency, the economy,or the central bank system\nand commercial bank system.But to some countries,\nnot a majority,some countries'\nfinancial stabilityis about capital controls.If a country is controlling\nsomewhere the valuationof their Fiat\ncurrency-- remember,we talked a lot about money.But if some don't\nwant to flood and theywant to control the value\nof their Fiat currency,then they often have\ncapital controls.And for those countries, this\nwhole world of crypto financetouches on that.And then the investing\npublic, the consuming public,we'll talk about investor\nprotection and consumerprotection are not\nexactly the same.The two words market\nintegrity means basicallywe promote economic activity\nif you can have confidence",

you can root\nout manipulation and fraud,there's more integrity.Usually very simply-- and this\nis a lot of economic study goesinto it--you lower the risk\npremium in that market.In essence, you can

Thalita, Matt.AUDIENCE: One of\nthe reasons he saidit wasn't a currency was because\nof the extreme volatility thatmeant it had no intrinsic\nvalue, which I disagreed with.I didn't think

fluctuating.And that was my take anyway.So I agree, but it's just a\ndifferent line of reasoningwhy I don't think--GARY GENSLER: So you think\nit's a different reasonthat it has intrinsic value.AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think\nit has intrinsic value,I just think that it should\nbe called a digital asset, notbecause it doesn't\nhave intrinsic value,but because it's not a\ndependable unit of

account should make\nit so that it is a currency.It has been used as a\ncurrency in the past.And whether five people use\nit or a million people use it,shouldn't the fact\nthat it can beused qualify it to be a\ncurrency, whether it'sto a certain amount of people\nshouldn't necessarily matter.GARY GENSLER: And so\nwho wants to arbitratebetween Matt and Kyle?Leonardo.AUDIENCE: Yeah, I wanted to\ngive an example of countrieswhere there is super\nhigh inflation, wheretheir domestic currencies\nlose what it's really worth.So people actually\nautomatically startto use dollars, for example,\nas their reference account.So it can be\nfunctional in the sensethat people can still\nexchange, but you can't reallymeasure until you peg\nto something else.And actually, Bitcoin's pegged\nto the value of somethingelse today.And that's where I think\nthe value of accounts--I'll be on the left side camp.GARY GENSLER: So it depends.And if it's in a country with\nhyperinflation, and I don't--I hope not-- have\nany of you livedin a country with hyperinflation\nin your lifetimes?So five or six of you have.So you know what it is like\nwhen you go into a restaurantthere's one set

right.A man named William Howey,\nhe ran for governor actuallyin Florida a couple\nof times and lost,but he had a real estate\nventure and he had those archesby his real estate venture.And he figured he could\nsell part of his landas citrus groves.So the question was, when he\nwas selling that land could thatbe, actually technically\nan investment contract?Because in 1933, the\nCongress of the

who\nare going to try to helpyou solve your problems.But when you feel\nlike they're justtrying to get between the\nwallpaper and the wallwith the narrowness and\nthe thinness of the sliceof their legal judgment,\nremember how Christopherjust gave us the Duck Test.And then step away and\nsay, well, maybe there'sanother business solution\nto what you're trying to do,because if it\ndoesn't pass the DuckTest at some point in\ntime, you're probablygoing to have your\nfriends from the IRS,or your friends from\nthe Justice Department,or the friends from the\nSEC knocking on your door.And those are the\nfriends you usuallydon't want to have\nknocking on your door.There's still 200\nto 300 ICOs a month.I just wanted to say that\nthe market has not gone away.And the Initial Coin\nOffering Market,which we're going to talk\nabout in a couple weeks,has all these attributes\nof the Howey Test.They're raising proceeds\nand they're usuallytrying to be functional.I want to skip ahead a\nlittle bit to somethingon public policy.And we're going to\ndo crypto exchanges,so I apologize I'm\nrunning tight on time.But I want to do something\nthat Lauren and Tom have seen.Well, let me

right now.Public policy development--\nthis is only five minutes,but I just wanted to mention\nhow public policy actuallycomes together.And Tom, you going\nto help me here?You got it?AUDIENCE: Analysis.GARY GENSLER: Analysis.Tom starts with analysis.Who thinks analysis\nis at the top of whathappens in public policy?Any show of hands?Tom, no.What's number one?What do you think happens first?What's that?AUDIENCE: Panic.GARY GENSLER: Panic.Public policy, huh?Panic?Lauren?AUDIENCE: I thought\nthis was goingto be a plug for your\npersonnel as policy.GARY GENSLER: Personnel as\npolicy is going to be in here,but messaging.If you don't get\nyour message right,you're never going to\nget to your analysis.But there's one other thing\nbetween messaging and analysis.AUDIENCE: Coalition.GARY GENSLER: Coalition\nbuilding or politics.So messaging-- with\nyour messaging,you can build a coalition,\nwhich is called politics.And if you get your\npolitics right,you can actually
