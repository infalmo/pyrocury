RBMK reactorand absolute operator\nof stupidity and neglectof any sort of safety\nsystems or safety culture.We're lucky to\nlive here in the USwhere our worst accident\nat Three Mile Islandwas not actually really\nthat much of an accident.There was a partial meltdown.There was not that much of\na release of radio nuclidesinto the atmosphere\nbecause we dothings like build\ncontainments on our reactors.If you think of what a\ntypical reactor looks like,like if you consider the\nMIT reactor as a scaled-downversion of a normal reactor--let's say you have a\ncommercial power reactor.You've got the core here.You've got a bunch of\nshielding around it.And you've got a dome\nthat's rather thickthat comprises the containment.That would be the core.This would be some shielding.So this is what you find in\nUS and most other reactors.For the RBMK reactors,\nthere was no containmentbecause it was thought\nthat nothing could happen.And boy, were they wrong.So I want to walk you guys\nthrough a chronology of whatactually happened at that\nthe Chernobyl reactor, whichyou guys can read on the NEA, or\nNuclear Energy Agency, website,the same place that\nyou find JANIS.And we're going to refer to a\nlot of the JANIS cross sectionsto explain why these\nsorts of events happened.So the whole point of\nwhat happened at Chernobylwas it was desire\nto see if you coulduse the spinning down\nturbine after you shutdown the reactor to\npower the emergencysystems at the reactor.This would be\nfollowing something,what's called a loss\nof off-site power.If the off-site\npower or the gridwas disconnected\nfrom the reactor,the reactor\nautomatically shuts down.But the turbine, like I\nshowed you a couple weeks ago,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.335}, {"text": "is this enormous spinning\nhulk of metal and machinerythat coasts down over a long\nperiod of, let's say, hours.And as it's spinning,\nthe generator coilsare still spinning and\nstill producing electricity,or they could be.So it was desire\nto find out, can weuse the spinning down turbine\nto power the emergency equipmentif we lose off-site power?So they had to\nsimulate this event.So what they actually\ndecided to dois coast down the reactor\nto a moderate power levelor very low power and\nsee what comes outof the turbine itself, or\nout of the generator rather.Now, there were a lot of\nflaws in the RBMK design.And I'd like to bring\nit up here so wecan talk about\nwhat it looks likeand what was wrong with it.So the RBMK is unlike any\nof the United States lightwater reactors that you\nmay have seen before.Many of the components\nare the same.There's still a light\nwater reactor coolantloop where water flows\naround fuel rods,goes into a steam\nseparator, better knownas a big heat exchanger.And the steam drives a\nturbine, which produces energy.And then this coolant\npump keeps it going.And then the water circulates.What makes it different, though,\nis that each of these fuel rodswas inside its\nown pressure tube.So the coolant was pressurized.And out here, this\nstuff right herewas the moderator\ncomposed of graphite.Unlike light water\nreactors in the US,the coolant was not the only\nmoderator in the reactor.Graphite also\nexisted, which meantthat, if the water went away,\nwhich would normally shut downa light water reactor\nfrom lack of moderation,graphite was still there\nto slow the neutrons downinto the high-fission\ncross-section area.And I'd like to pull\nup JANIS and show youwhat I mean with the\nuranium cross section.So let's go again to uranium-235\nand pull up its fission cross", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.346}, {"text": "section.Let's see fission.I can make it a\nlittle thicker too.So again, the goal\nof the moderatoris to take neutrons from high\nenergies like 1 to 10 MeVwhere the fission cross\nsection is relatively lowand slow them down into this\nregion where fission is,let's say, 1,000\ntimes more likely.And in a light water\nreactor in the US,if the coolant goes away,\nso does the moderation.And there's nothing left\nto slow those neutrons downto make fission more likely.In the RBMK, that's\nnot the case.The graphite is still there.The graphite is cooled by\na helium-nitrogen mixturebecause the neutron interactions\nin the graphite that's slowingdown--we've always talked about what\nhappens from the point of viewof the neutron.But what about the point of\nview of the other material?Any energy lost by\nthe neutrons is gainedby the moderating material.So the graphite gets really hot.And you have to flow some\nnon-oxygen-containing gasmixture like helium\nand nitrogen, whichis pretty inert, to\nkeep that graphite cool.And then in between\nthe graphite moderatorwere control rods, about 200\nof them or so, 30 of whichwere required to be down in\nthe reactor at any given timein order to control power.And that was a design rule.That was broken during\nthe actual experiment.And then on top of here, on\ntop of this biological shield,you could walk on top of it.So the tops of those\npressure tubes,despite being about 350\nkilo chunks of concrete,you could walk on top of them.That's pretty cool,\nkind of scary too.So what happened in\nchronological order was,around midnight, the decision\nwas made to undergo this testand start spinning\ndown the turbine.But the grid operator came back\nand said, no, you can't justcut the reactor\npower to nothing.You have to maintain at a\nrather high power for a while,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.323}, {"text": "about 500 megawatts electric\nor half the rated powerof the reactor.And what that had\nthe effect of doingis continuing to create fission\nproducts, including xenon-135.We haven't mentioned\nthis one yet.You'll talk about it quite a\nlot in 22.05 in neutron physics.Black shirt really\nshows chalk well.What xenon-135 does\nis it just sits there.It's a noble gas.It has a half-life\nof a few days.So it decays on the slow side\nfor as fission products go.But it also absorbs lots and\nlots and lots of neutrons.Let's see if I could find\nwhich one is the xenon one.There we go.So here, I've plotted\nthe total cross-sectionfor xenon-135 and the\nabsorption cross-section.And notice how,\nfor low energies,pretty much the entire\ncross section of xenonis made up of absorption.Did you guys in your\nhomework see anything thatreached about 10 million barns?No.Xenon-135 is one of the best\nneutron absorbers there is.And reactors produce\nit constantly.So as they're operating,\nyou build up xenon-135that you have to account for\nin your sigma absorption crosssection.Because like you guys\nsaw in the homework,if you want to write what's\nthe sigma absorption crosssection of the\nreactor, it's the sumof every single isotope in\nthe reactor of its numberdensity times its\nabsorption cross section.And so that would include\neverything for waterand let's say the\nuranium and the xenonthat you're building up.When the reactor starts up,\nthe number density of xenonis 0 because you don't have\nanything to have produced it.When you start operating, you'll\nreach the xenon equilibriumlevel where it will build\nto a certain level thatwill counteract the\nreactivity of the reactor.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.216}, {"text": "And then your\nk-effective expression,where it sources over\nabsorption plus leakage,this has the effect of\nraising sigma absorptionand lowering k effective.The trick is it doesn't\nlast for very long.It built decays with a\nhalf-life of about five days.And when you try and\nraise the reactor power,you will also start\nto burn it out.So if you're operating at\na fairly low power level,you'll both be decaying\nand burning xenonwithout really knowing\nwhat's going on.And that's exactly\nwhat happened here.So an hour or so later--let me pull up the\nchronology again.A little more than\nan hour later,so the reactor power stabilized\nat something like 30 megawatts.And they were like,\nwhat is going on?Why is that reactor\npower so low?We need to increase\nthe reactor power.So what did they do?A couple of things.One was remove all but six\nor seven of the control rodsgoing way outside the\nspec of the designbecause 30 were needed\nto actually maintainthe reactor at a stable power.All the while, the xenon\nthat had been building upis still there keeping the\nreactor from going critical.It's what was the main reason\nthat the reactor didn't evenhave very much power.But it was also burning\nout at the same time.So all the while--let's say if we were to show\na graph of two things, time,xenon inventory,\nand as a solid lineand let's say control rod\nworth as a dotted line.The xenon inventory\nat full powerwould have been at some level.And then it would start\nto decay and burn out.While at the same\ntime, the controlrod worth, as you remove\ncontrol rods from the reactor--every time you remove one, you\nlose some control rod worth,would continue to diminish\nleading to the point wherebad stuff is going to happen.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.173}, {"text": "Let me make sure I\ndidn't lose my place.So at any rate, as they started\npulling the control rods out,a couple of interesting quirks\nhappened in terms of feedback.So let's look back\nat this design.Like any reactor,\nthis reactor hadwhat's called a negative\nfuel temperature coefficient.What that means is that,\nwhen you heat up the fuel,two things happen.One, the cross section\nfor anything, absorptionor fission, would go up.But the number density\nwould also go down.As the atoms physically\nspaced out in the fuel,their number density\nwould go down,lowering the macroscopic\ncross section for fission.And that's arguably\na good thing.The problem is, at\nbelow about 20% power,of the reactor had what's called\na positive void coefficient,which meant that, if\nyou boil the coolant,you increase the reactor power.Because the other thing that--I think I mentioned this once.And you calculated in the\nhomework the absorption crosssection of hydrogen is not 0.It's small, but\nfairly significant.Let's actually\ntake a look at it.We can always see this in JANIS.Go back down to\nhydrogen, hydrogen-1.Then we look at the\nabsorption cross section.And of course, it started\nus with the linear scale.Let's go logarithmic.Oh!OK!So at low energy, at 10 to the\nminus 8 to 10 to the minus 7,it's around a barn.Not super high, but\nabsolutely not negligible,which meant that part of\nthe normal functionalityof the RBMK depended on the\nabsorption of the water to helpabsorb some of those neutrons.With that water gone,\nthere was less absorption.But there was still a ton of\nmoderation in this graphitemoderator.So they still could get slow.But then there'd\nbe more of them.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.45}, {"text": "And that would cause\nthe power to increase.And then that caused\nmore of the coolantto boil, which would cause\nless absorption, which wouldcause the power to increase.Yeah, Charlie?AUDIENCE: So did they remove\nthe water from the reactor?MICHAEL SHORT: They did\nnot remove the waterfrom the reactor.However, as the power started\nto rise, some of the waterstarted to boil.And so you can still have,\nlet's say, steam flowing throughand still remove\nsome of the heat.However, you don't have\nthat dense or waterto act as an absorber.And that's what really\nundid this reactor.In addition, they\ndecided to disablethe ECCS, or the Emergency\nCore Cooling System,which you're just\nnot supposed to do.So they shut down a\nbunch of these systemsto see if you could\npower the other onesfrom the spinning down turbine.And then, as they noticed\nthat the reactor wasgetting less and\nless stable, theyhad almost all the rods out.Some of these pressure tubes\nstarted to bump and jump.These 350-kilogram pressure\ntube caps were just rattling.I mean, imagine\nsomething that weighs 900pounds or so rattling around.And there's a few\nhundred of them.So there was someone in\nthe control room that said,the caps are rattling.What the heck?And didn't quite make it\ndown the spiral staircasebecause, about 10 seconds\nlater, everything went wrong.And so I want to pull\nup this actual timelineso you can see it splits\nfrom minutes to seconds.Because the speed at which\nthis stuff started to go wrongwas pretty striking.So for example, the control rods\nraised at 1:19 in the morning.Two minutes later, when\nthe power starts to becomeunstable, the caps on the\nfuel channels-- which, again,are like 350-kilogram blocks--start jumping in their sockets.And a lot of that was--we go back to the RBMK reactor.As the coolant started\nto boil here, well,that boiling force actually\ncreates huge pressureinstabilities, which\nwould cause the pressure", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.354}, {"text": "tubes to jump up and\ndown, eventually rupturingalmost every single one of\nthem with enough force to shootthese 350-kilogram caps.And what did they say?I like the language\nthat they used--jumping in their sockets.So 50 seconds later,\npressure failsin the steam drums,\nwhich means there's beensome sort of containment leak.So all the while, the\ncoolant was boiling.The absorption was going down.The power was going up.Repeat, repeat, repeat.And the power jumped to about\n100 times the rated powerin something like four seconds.So it was normally\n1,000-megawatt electricreactor, which is about\n3,200 megawatts thermal.It was producing\nnearly half a terawattof thermal power for a\nvery short amount of timeuntil it exploded.Now, it's interesting.A lot of folks call Chernobyl\na nuclear explosion.That's actually a misnomer.A nuclear explosion would be\na nuclear weapon, somethingset off by an enormous chain\nreaction principally heatedby fission or fusion.That's not actually what\nhappened at Chernobyl,nor at Fukushima, nor was that\nthe worry at Three Mile Island.Not to say it wasn't\na horrible thing,but it wasn't an actual\nnuclear explosion.At first, what happened\nwas a pressure explosion.So there was an enormous\nrelease of steamas the power built up to 100\ntimes normal operating power.The steam force was so\nlarge that it actuallyblew the reactor lid\nup off of the thing.And I think I have a picture\nof that somewhere here too.It should be further down.Yeah, to give you a\nlittle sense of scale.The reactor cover, which\nweighed about 1,000 tons,launched into the air and\nlanded above the reactorsending most of the\nreactor componentsup to a kilometer up in the air.Four seconds later,\nthat was followed", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.255}, {"text": "by a hydrogen explosion.Let me get that down\nto that chronology.So yeah.At 1:23 and 40 seconds\nin the morning--oh, yeah.So I should mentioned why this\nhappened-- emergency insertionof all the control rods.The last part that this diagram\ndoesn't mention is thesecontrol rods-- and I'll\ndraw this up here--we're tipped with about\nsix inches of graphite.So if these were two\ngraphite channels--let's say these are carbon--and this is your\ncontrol rod, the goalwas to get this control rod\nall the way into the reactor.One part they didn't\nmention was theywere tipped with about six\ninches of graphite, whichonly functions as\nadditional moderator.Graphite is one of the\nlowest absorbing materialsin the periodic table, second,\nI think, only to oxygen.And if we pull up\ngraphite cross sections,I've plotted here the\ntotal cross section,the elastic scattering\ncross section.And down here, in\nthe 0.001 barn level,is the absorption cross\nsection, about 1,000 times lowerthan water.So you're shoving more material\nin the reactor that slows downneutrons even\nmore, bringing theminto the high-fission region\nwithout absorbing anything.And they jammed\nabout halfway down,about 2 and 1/2 feet down,\nleaving the extra graphiteright in the center\nof the core whereit could do the most damage.And it didn't take\nthat much time.Yeah?AUDIENCE: So my understanding is\nthat, also, one of the designsis that the control rods\ndidn't immediately drop down.But they were slowly lowered.MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.They took 7 to 10 seconds.AUDIENCE: If they had a\nsystem where they did drop,would that have\npossibly actually setthe system down properly?MICHAEL SHORT: I'm not sure.I don't know whether lowering\ncontrol rods into somethingthat was undergoing\nsteam explosionswould have actually helped.I mean, to me, by this\npoint, it was all over.So the extra moderator\nthat was dumped inwas the last kick in\nthe pants this thing", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.267}, {"text": "needed to go absolutely insane.And if we go back to the\ntimeline on the second level,control rods inserted\nat 1:23 and 40 seconds.Explosion, four seconds later,\nto 120 times full power,getting towards\na terawatt or so.One second later, the 1,000-ton\nlid launches off from the firstexplosion.Very shortly after\nthat, second explosion.And that happened\nbecause of this reaction.Well, just about anything\ncorroding with waterwill make pretty\nmuch anything oxideplus hydrogen, the same\nchemical explosion thatwas the undoing of\nFukushima and was the worryat Three Mile Island that\nthere was a hydrogen bubblebuilding because of\ncorrosion reactionswith whatever happened\nto be in the core.This happens with zirconium\npretty vigorously.But it happens with\nother materials too.If you oxidize\nsomething with water,you leave behind the\nhydrogen. And the hydrogen,in a very wide range of\nconcentrations in the air,is explosive.We're actually not allowed\nto use hydrogen at about 4%in any of the labs here because\nthat reaches the flammabilityor explosive limit.So for my PhD, we were\ndoing these experimentscorroding materials\nin liquid lead.And we wanted to\ndump in pure hydrogento see what happens when\nthere's no oxygen. We were told,absolutely not.We had to drill a hole\nin the side of the wallsthat the hydrogen would\nvent outside and dosome calculations to show if\nthe entire bottle of hydrogenemptied into the lab\nat once, which it coulddo if the cap of the\nbottle breaks off,it would not reach\n4% concentration.So hydrogen explosions are\npretty powerful things.You guys ever seen people\nmaking water from scratch?Mix hydrogen and oxygen in\na bottle and light a match?We've got a video of it\ncirculating somewhere aroundhere because for RTC, for the\nReactor Technology Course,I do this in front\nof a

that structurally\nsound and isin danger of partial collapse.So yeah, more difficult\nefforts are ahead.But let's now talk about\nwhat happened next.I'm going to jump to\nthe very end of this.The actual way that the accident\nwas noticed was the spreadof the radioactive cloud\nto not-so-close-by Sweden.So it was noticed that folks\nentering a reactor in Swedenhad contaminants on them,\nwhich they thought wascoming from their own reactor.Good first assumption.When it was determined\nthat nothingwas amiss at the\nreactor in Sweden,folks started to\nanalyze wind patternsand find out what happened.And then it was\nclear that the USSRhad tried to cover up\nthe Chernobyl accident.But you can't cover up fallout.And it eventually\nspread pretty wide,covering most of\nEurope and Russiaand surprisingly not\nSpain, lucky themfor the wind patterns that\nday, or those few days.So what happened is a few days\nafter the actual accident,a graphite fire\nstarted to break out.Because graphite, when\nexposed to air, well,you can do the chemistry.Add graphite plus oxygen, you\nstart making carbon dioxide.So graphite burns when it's hot.And as you can see\nfrom the video--where is that nice still\nof burning graphite?Yeah.That graphite was pretty hot.So a lot of that smoke\nincluded burning graphiteand a lot of the materials\nfrom the reactor itself.Now, when you build up\nfission products in a reactorand they get\nvolatilized like this,the ones that tend\nto get out firstwould be things like\nthe noble gases.So the whole xenon inventory\nof the reactor was released.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.494}, {"text": "It's estimated at about 100%.And I can actually\npull up those figures.When we talk about how\nmuch of which radionuclidewas released.That's also a typo.If somebody

talking\nlike megacuries.It might be giga.I can't do that math in my head.A lot of radiation.The problem with that\nis iodine behavesjust like any other\nhalogen.

turns everything\nyellow and it justreacts with acids and stuff.I haven't really done\nvery much with it.So--MICHAEL SHORT: OK.I happen to have\nextensive practice playingwith iodine in my home

have been in\nthe form of other compounds.Some of it may have\nbeen elemental--probably not likely.But there was certainly\nsome iodine vapor.And about half of\nthat was released.The problem is

released--remember they said, OK, at\naround the 26th of Aprilor the 2nd of May or so\nthe release was stopped?Not according to our data.That's when the graphite\nfire picked up again.In addition, the\ncore of Chernobyl,which had undergone a\nmostly total meltdown,was sitting in a pool on\ntop of this concrete pad.So let's just call\nthis liquid stuff--the actual word that we use\nin parlance is called corium.It's our tongue-in-cheek\nword for every elementmixed together in a\nhot radioactive soup.First of all, it\nstarted to redistribute,reacting with any water that was\npresent, flashing it to steam.And the steam caused additional\ndispersion of radionuclides.And eventually, it\nburrowed its waythrough and into the\nground, releasing more.It's the worst\nnuclear thing that'sever happened in the\nhistory of nuclear things.Quite a mess.And luckily, it did sort\nof taper off after this.But let's now look\ninto what happens next.And this is the nice intro to\nthe third part of the course.Iodine is preferentially\nuptaken by the thyroid glandsomewhere right about here.So has anyone ever\nheard of the idea", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.106}, {"text": "of taking iodine tablets in\nthe case of a nuclear disaster?Anyone have any idea why?If you saturate your\nthyroid with iodine,then if you ingest\nradioactive iodine,it's less likely to\nbe permanently takenby the thyroid.So this actually\nprovided some statisticson the probability of\ngetting thyroid cancerfrom radioactive\niodine ingestion.Luckily, the statistics\nwere quite poor,which means that not\nmany people were exposed.It was somewhere around 1,300\nor so, not like millions.Yeah, 1,300 people total.But what I want to jump to is\nthe dose-versus-risk curve.And this is going to belie\nall of our discussionabout the biological long-term\neffects of radioactivity.What's the most striking thing\nyou see as part of this curve?AUDIENCE: Error bars.MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.That's the first thing I saw.There are six different models\nfor how dose an increasedrisk of cancer proceeds.And they all fall within\nalmost all the errorbars of these measurements.I say, again, thank\nGod that the errorbars are so high because that\nmeans that the sample size wasso low.So when folks say\nwe don't reallyknow how much radioactivity\ncauses how much cancer, they'reright because, luckily,\nwe don't have enough datafrom people being exposed to\nknow that really, really well.So some folks say we\nshould be cautious.I kind of agree with them.Some folks say the\njury's still out.I also agree with them.But you can start to estimate\nthese sorts of thingsby knowing how much\nradiation energy was absorbedand to what organ.So I think the only technical\nthing I want to go over todayis the different units of dose.Because as you\nstart to read thingsin the reading,\nwhich I recommendyou do if you haven't\nbeen doing yet,you're going to encounter a lot\nof different units of radiationdose

And these are justusually written as rem.So a rad is simple.Let's see.100 rads is the same as 1 gray.And 100 rem is the\nsame as 1 sievert.And for the case\nof gamma radiation,these units are actually equal.I particularly like\nthis set of unitsbecause this is the kind\nof SI of radiation unitsbecause it comes directly\nfrom measurable calculatablequantities.Like the gray, for example,\nthe actual unit of grayis joules absorbed per\nkilogram of absorber.It's a pretty simple\nunit to understand.If you know how many\nradioactive particles or gammasor whatever that\nyou have absorbed,you can

susceptibleit is to gaining cancer risk.Because every cell division\nis a copy of its DNA.And any time that radiation\ngoes in and damages or changesthat DNA by either\ncausing what'scalled a thiamine

are.Memorize them.I want you to try and think\nof the pattern between them.The tissues that\nbasically don't matter,like the non-marrow part of the\nbone, dead skin cells, muscles,things that

it's still 4,000 people that\nshould've never happened to.And effects were felt far\naway in towns like Gomeland-- can't read that\none because there's notenough pixels.Because of the way that,\nlet's say, rainwater--or let's say the vapor\ncloud from the reactor was--the way rainwater\ncaused it to fallon certain places, which\nstill, to this day,can have a really large\ncontamination area.And this brings me a little\nbit into what should we beworried about from Fukushima--a whole lot less than Chernobyl.And the reason why\nis Fukushima didundergo a hydrogen\nexplosion and didand still continues to release\ncesium-137 into the ocean.Luckily, for us,\nthe ocean is big.And except for fish caught\nright near around Fukushima,even though concentrations\ncan be measured at hundredsto

the whole second\npart of the courseor what happened in Chernobyl.Yeah.AUDIENCE: Yeah.Could you explain the\nquality factor termand how you find that?MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.Well, there's two\nquality factors.There is the quality factor for\nradiation, which will tell you,let's say, how much\nmore cell damagea given amount of a given type\nof radiation of the same energywill deposit into a cell.And the tissue\nequivalency factortells you, well,\nwhat's the addedrisk of some sort of defect\nleading to cell death or canceror some other defect from\nthat radiation absorption.So to me, the tissue\nequivalency factoris roughly, but not\ncompletely, approximatedby the cell division rate.And the radiation\nquality factor isgoing to be quite proportional\nto the stopping power.You'll see a term called the\nLinear Energy Transfer, or LET.This is the stopping power unit\nused in the biology community.It's stopping power.And luckily, the\nTurner reading actuallysays it's somewhere\nburied in a paragraph.LET is stopping power.So if you start plotting\nthese two together,you might find some\nstriking similarities.I saw two other\nquestions up here.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Why is Chernobyl\nstill
