[{"text": "GILBERT STRANG:\nWell, I'm Gil Strang.And I'm very happy if you\nknow the linear algebravideos on OpenCourseWare\nor on YouTube.That's for the\nmath course 18.06.And I'm even happier\nif you like them.And I'm here today to update\nthem for several reasons.Well, a lots happened in\nlinear algebra in these years.Fortunately, the\nwhole subject has justbecome more and more essential,\nmore and more important, moreand more beautiful.And so I wanted to say something\nabout those later steps.And also, when I teach it now,\nI have a new starting point.And I'll show you that.So I'll go a little slowly\non that starting point.The slides tell you\nthe whole course.And that's crazy to have a full\ncourse within a short video.But especially the\nfirst part is new.And I'm even writing\na textbook calledLinear Algebra for Everyone\nthat will start this way.I hope that the new start brings\nin real linear algebra ideasright away.And let me show you\nwhere those are.So this is an outline\nof the whole video.And the first\nline, which I thinkabout in my mind as\nmatrix A, is a productof a C matrix, a column\nmatrix, and a row matrix R.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.849}, {"text": "And you'll see what those are.So that's the new idea.That will come first.Then these are five\nfamous essential shorthanddescriptions of the key\nchapters of linear algebra,the key chapters.So they represent, for example,\nLU is those letters are famous.And computer commands\nwould be exactlythose letters LU for elimination\nfor solving equations,the first job of linear algebra.And then QR.So Q is a very interesting\nimportant type of matrix.That's standing for\nan orthogonal matrix.There is the word\northogonal or perpendicular.So those are the best\nmatrices to compute with.And that QR gets us there.And S is for a symmetric matrix.And it will involve--oh, well, I should\nsay, the first half,ending with there, with QR,\nis about solving equations.The second half, these\nthree are about eigenvaluesand eigenvectors\nand singular values,a different way to approach the\nwhole subject and a very, veryimportant way.Among my goals is to help\ncourses around the worldget singular values\nincluded because you reallydon't want to miss them.That's the high\npoint of the theory.And it's expressed\nlike all the othersas breaking a matrix into\ntwo or three pieces, twoor three parts.So that's my plan\nfor this video.And I hope it's helpful.Again, it's a whole\ncourse in a short time.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.299}, {"text": "And please go to the real\n18.06 videos for the details.Thanks", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.31}]
