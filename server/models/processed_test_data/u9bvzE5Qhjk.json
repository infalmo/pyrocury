theindividual journal articles just so youguys know well ahead of time what wewant you to prepare for the grouppresentations we're looking for fifteento twenty minutes on what you guys havedone as a group so that would be a fewslides summarizing each of the weeksthat we've gone through so far so thefirst week on what are all of yourdesign options presented in some sort ofcompact way more compact than Ipresented in the lecture then I'd beinterested to see how did you choosewhich design parameters are importantwhich parts did you eliminate easilywhich design choices did you eliminateright away and then how did you chooseyour eventual design path and so if allthat can be in a 15 to 20 minutecoherent presentation that's great it'sup to you guys whether everyone wants topresent tag team or you do one personagain if anyone is kind of shy Iencourage you to present if anyone hassome serious problems presenting I'm notgoing to force you to do it but I reallywant everyone to give it a shot so justkeep that in mind as far as the journalcommunications I'm looking for about athousand words focusing on what each oneof you individually has done I've posteda couple of templates on the
