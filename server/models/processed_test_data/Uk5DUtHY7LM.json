together.Unfortunately, this\nthing is sort of stuck.We're going to need a\nlater, so I don't know.I'll put it up for now.So first just a bit of notation.This symbol, you\nshould think of itlike the dot product,\nor the inner product.It's just saying that\nbracket f g is the integral.It's a number that you get.So this is a number that\nyou get from the functionf and the function g\nby taking f, takingits complex conjugate,\nmultiplying it by g,and then integrating\noverall positions.All right?So it's a way to get a number.And you should think about it\nas the analog for functionsof the dot product for vectors.It's a way to get a\nnumber out of two vectors.And so, for example, with\nvectors we could do v dot w,and this is some number.And it has a nice\nproperty that v dot v,we can think it as v squared,\nit's something like a length.It's strictly positive,\nand it's somethinglike the length of a vector.Similarly, if I take f and\ntake its bracket with f,this is equal to the\nintegral dx of f squared,and in particular, f could be\ncomplex, so f norm squared.This is strictly non-negative.It could vanish, but it's\nnot negative at a point,hence the norm squared.So this will be zero\nif and only if what?f is 0, f is the\n0 function, right.So the same way that\nif you take a vector,and you take its dot product\nwith itself, take it the norm,it's 0 if an only\nif the vector is 0.So this beast satisfies a lot\nof the properties of a dotproduct.You should think about\nit as morally equivalent.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "We'll talk about that\nin more detail later.Second, basic postulate\nof quantum mechanics,to every observable is\nassociated an operator,and it's an operator acting\non the space of functionsor on the space\nof wave functions.And to every operator\ncorrespondingto an observable in\nquantum mechanicsare associated a special\nset of functions calledthe eigenfunctions, such\nthat when the operator actson that function, it gives\nyou the same functionback times a constant.What these functions\nmean, physically,is they are the wave functions\ndescribing configurationswith a definite value of the\ncorresponding observable.If I'm in an eigenfunction\nof position witheigenvalue x naught, awesome.Thank you, AV person, thank you.So if your system is described\nby a wave function whichis an eigenfunction\nof the positionoperator with\neigenvalue x naught,that means you can be\nconfident that the system isin the configuration\ncorrespondingto having a definite\nposition x naught.Right?It's not a superposition\nof different positions.It is at x naught.Similarly, momentum,\nmomentum has eigenfunctions,and we know what these guys are.These are the exponentials,\ne to the iKX's.They're the eigenfunctions, and\nthose are the wave functionsdescribing states with\ndefinite value of the momentum,of the associated observable.Energy as an operator, energy is\ndescribed by an operator, whichhas eigenfunctions which I'll\ncall phi sub n, with energyas E sub n, those\nare the eigenvalues.And if I tell you that your\nwave function is the state phisub 2, what that tells\nyou is that the system hasa definite energy, E\nsub 2, correspondingto that eigenvalue.Cool?And this is true for\nany physical observable.But these are sort\nof the basic onesthat we'll keep focusing on,\nposition, momentum, and energy,for the next while.Now a nice property about\nthese eigenfunctions", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "is that for different\neigenvalues,the associated wave functions\nare different functions.And what I mean by\nsaying they're differentfunctions is that\nthey're actuallyorthogonal functions in the\nsense of this dot product.If I have a state\ncorresponding to be at x 0,definite position\nx 0, that meansthey're in eigenfunction of\nposition with eigenvalue x 0,and I have another\nthat correspondsto being at x1, an eigenfunction\nof the position operatoror the eigenvalue x1, then\nthese wave functions areorthogonal to each other.And we get 0 if x 0\nis not equal to x1.Everyone cool with that?Now, meanwhile not only\nare they orthogonalbut they're normalized\nin a particular way.The inner product gives\nme a delta function,which goes beep once, so that\nif I integrate against itI get a 1.Same thing with momentum.And you do this, this you're\nchecking on the problem set.I don't remember if it\nwas last one or this one.And for the energies,\nenergy 1, if Iknow the system is in state\nenergy 1, and let's say e sub nand e sub m, those\nare different statesif n and m are not\nequal to each other.And this inner product\nis 0 if n and m are notequal to each other\nand 1 if they are.Their properly normalized.Everyone cool with that?Yeah.AUDIENCE: Is it possible\nthat two eigenfunctionshave the same eigenvalue?PROFESSOR: Absolutely.It is absolutely possible\nfor two eigenfunctionsto have the same eigenvalue.That is certainly possible.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Yeah, good.Thank you, this is\na good technicalitythat I didn't want to get into,\nbut I'll go and get into it.It's a very good question.So the question is,\nis it possible for twodifferent eigenfunctions to\nhave the same eigenvalue.Could there be two states\nwith the same energy ,different states, same energy?Yeah, that's\nabsolutely possible.And we'll run into that.And there's nice\nphysics encoded in it.But let's think about\nwhat that means.The subsequent question is\nwell, if that's the case,are they really\nstill orthogonal?And here's the crucial thing.The crucial thing is, let's\nsay I take one function,I'll call the function phi 1,\nconsider the function phi 1.And let it have energy E1,\nso that E acting on phi 1", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "is equal to E1 phi 1.And let there be\nanother function, phi 2,such that the energy\noperator acting on phi 2is also equal to E1 phi 2.These are said to be degenerate.Degenerate doesn't mean you\ngo out and trash your car,degenerate that the\nenergies are the same.So what does this tell me?This tells me a cool fact.If I take a wave function phi,\nand I will call this phi star,in honor of Shri\nKulkarni, so I'vegot this phi star, which is\na linear combination alphaphi 1 plus beta phi 2,\na linear combinationof them, a superposition\nof those two states.Is this also an\nenergy eigenfunction?Yeah, because if I act on phi\nstar with E, then it's linear,so E acting on phi star is\nE acting on alpha phi 1,alpha's a constant,\ndoesn't care.Phi 1 gives me an E1.Similarly, E acting on\nphi 2 gives me an E1.So if I act with E\non this guy, thisis equal to, from both of these\nI get an overall factor of E1.So notice that we get the\nsame vector back, timesa constant, a common constant.So when we have\ndegenerate eigenfunctions,we can take arbitrary\nlinear combinations to them,get another degenerate\neigenfunction.Cool?So this is like,\nimagine I have a vector,and I have another vector.And they share the property\nthat they're both eigenfunctionsof some operator.That means any linear\ncombination of themis also, right?So there's a whole\nvector space, there'sa whole space of\npossible functionsthat all have the\nsame eigenvalue.So now you say, well, look,\nare these two orthogonalto each other?No.These two?No.But here's the thing.If you have a vector space,\nif you have a the space,you can always find\northogonal guys and a basisfor that space, yes?So while it's not true that\nthe eigenfunctions are alwaysorthogonal, it is true--we will not prove this, but we\nwill discuss the proof of itlater by pulling the\nmathematician out", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "of the closet--the proof will say that\nit is possible to finda set of eigenfunctions which\nare orthogonal in preciselythis fashion, even if\nthere are degeneracies.OK?That theorem is called\nthe spectral theorem.And we'll discuss it later.So it is always\npossible to do so.But you must be alert that\nthere may be degeneracies.There aren't always\ndegeneracies.In fact, degeneracies\nare very special.Why should two numbers\nhappen to be the same?Something has to be forcing\nthem to be the same.That's going to be an\nimportant theme for us.But it certainly is possible.Good question.Other questions?Yeah.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Yeah, so using\nthe triangular brackets--so there's another notation for\nthe same thing, which is f g,but this carries some\nslightly different weight.It mean something slightly--\nyou'll see this in books,and this means something\nvery similar to this.But I'm not going to\nuse this notation.It's called Dirac notation.We'll talk about it\nlater in the semester,but we're not going to\ntalk about it just yet.But when you see\nthis, effectively itmeans the same thing as this.This is sort of like dialect.You know, it's like\nFrench and Quebecois.Other questions?My wife's Canadian.Other questions?OK.So given this fact,\ngiven the factthat we can\nassociate observablesto operators, operators\ncome with special functions,the eigenfunctions, those\neigenfunctions correspondingto have a definite\nvalue of the observable,and they're orthonormal.This tells us,\nand this is reallythe statement of the\nspectral theorem,that any function can be\nexpanded in a basis of stateswith definite values\nof some observable.So for example,\nconsider position.I claim that any\nwave function canbe expanded as a\nsuperposition of stateswith definite position.So here's an arbitrary\nfunction, here'sthis set of states with definite\nposition, the delta functions.And I can write any\nfunction as a superpositionwith some coefficients of\nstates with definite position,integrating over all\npossible positions, x0.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And this is also sort\nof trivially true,because what's this integral?Well, it's an integral, dx0\nover all possible positionsof this delta function.But we're evaluating\nat x, so this is 0unless x is equal to x0.So I can just put\nin x instead of x0,and that gives me psi of x.Sort of tautological We\ncan do the same thingfor momentum eigenfunctions.I claim that any\nfunction can be expandedin a superposition of\nmomentum eigenfunctions, whereI sum over all possible\nvalues in the momentumwith some weight.This psi tilde of\nK is just tellingme how much amplitude there\nis at that wave number.Cool?But this is the Fourier theorem,\nit's a Fourier expansion.So purely mathematically,\nwe know that this is true.But there's also the\nphysical statement.Any state can be expressed\nas a superposition of stateswith definite momentum.There's a math in here, but\nthere's also physics in it.Finally, this is less obvious\nfrom a mathematical pointof view, because I\nhaven't even told youwhat energy is, any wave\nfunction can be expandedin states with definite energy.So this is a state, my state\nEn, with definite energy,with some coefficient summed\nover all possible valuesof the energy.Given any physical observable,\nany physical observable,momentum, position,\nangular momentum,whatever, given any\nphysical observable,a given wave function\ncan be expandedas some superposition of\nhaving definite values of that.Will it in general have definite\nvalues of the observable?Well a general state be\nan energy eigenfunction?No.But any state is a superposition\nof energy eigenfunctions.Will a random state\nhave definite position?Certainly not.You could have\nthis wave function.Superposition.Yeah.AUDIENCE: Why is the\nenergy special suchthat you can make an arbitrary\nstate with a countable numberof energy eigenfunctions\nrather than havingto do a continuous spectrum?PROFESSOR: Excellent question.So I'm going to phrase\nthat slightly differently.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "It's an excellent\nquestion, and we'llcome to that at the\nend of today's lecture.So the question is,\nthose are integrals, thatis a sum over discrete things.Why?Why is the possible values\nof the position continuous,possible values of momentum\ncontinuous, and possible valuesof energy discrete?The answer to this\nwill become apparentover the course of your\nnext few problem sets.You have to do some\nproblems to getyour fingers dirty to\nreally understand this.But here's the\nstatement, and we'llsee the first version of this\nat the end of today's lecture.Sometimes the allowed energies\nof a system, the energyeigenvalues, are discrete.Sometimes they are continuous.They will be discrete when you\nhave bound states, states thatare trapped in some\nregion and aren't allowedto get arbitrarily far away.They'll be continuous\nwhen you have states thatcan get arbitrarily far away.Sometimes the momentum will be\nallowed to be discrete values,sometimes it will be allowed\nto be continuous values.And we'll see exactly\nwhy subsequently.But the thing I\nwant to emphasizeis that I'm writing this to\nemphasize that it's possiblethat each of these can be\ndiscrete or continuous.The important thing is that once\nyou pick your physical system,you ask what are the allowed\nvalues of position, whatare the allowed\nvalues of momentum,and what are the allowed\nvalues of energy.And then you sum over\nall possible values.Now, in the examples we looked\nat yesterday, or last lecture,the energy could\nhave been discrete,as in the case of\nthe infinite well,or continuous, as in the\ncase of the free particle.In the case of a\ncontinuous particlethis would have\nbeen an integral.In the case of the system\nsuch as a free particle, wherethe energy could take any\nof a continuous numberof possible values, this would\nbe a continuous integral.To deal with that,\nI'm often goingto use the notation, just\nshorthand, integral sum.Which I know is a\nhorrible bastardizationof all that's good and\njust, but on the other hand,emphasizes the fact\nthat in some systemsyou will get continuous,\nin some systems discrete,and sometimes you'll have\nboth continuous and discrete.For example, in\nhydrogen, in hydrogen", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "we'll find that there\nare bound stateswhere the electron is stuck\nto the hydrogen nucleus,to the proton.And there are discrete\nallowed energy levelsfor that configuration.However, once you\nionize the hydrogen,the electron can add\nany energy you want.It's no longer bound.It can just get\narbitrarily far away.And there are an uncountable\ninfinity, a continuous setof possible states.So in that situation,\nwe'll find that wehave both the discrete\nand continuous seriesof possible states.Yeah.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Yeah, sure,\nif you work on a lattice.So for example, consider the\nfollowing quantum system.I have an undergraduate.And that undergraduate has\nbeen placed in 1 of 12 boxes.OK?Now, what's the state\nof the undergraduate?I don't know.Is it a definite position state?It might be.But probably it's a\nsuperposition, an arbitrarysuperposition, right?Very impressive\nundergraduates at MIT.OK, other questions.Yeah.AUDIENCE: Do these\nthree [INAUDIBLE]hold even if the probability\nchanges over time?PROFESSOR: Excellent question.We'll come back to that.Very good question,\nleading question.OK, so we have this.The next thing is that\nenergy eigenfunctions satisfysome very special properties.And in particular,\nenergy eigenfunctionshave the property from the\nSchrodinger equation i hbar d t on psi of x and t is\nequal to the energy operatoracting on psi of x and t.This tells us that\nif we have psix 0 time t 0 is equal to phi\nn of x, as we saw last time,then the wave function,\npsi at x at time tis equal to phi n of x.And it only changes by an\noverall phase, e to the minus iEn t over h bar.And this ratio En\nupon h bar will oftenbe written omega n is\nequal to En over h bar.This is just the\nDupre relations.Everyone cool with that?", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So are energy eigenfunctions--how to say.No wave function is more\nmorally good than another.But some are\nparticularly convenient.Energy eigenfunctions\nhave the nice propertythat while they're not\nin a definite positionand they don't necessarily\nhave a definite momentum,they do evolve over time in\na particularly simple way.And that and the\nsuperposition principleallow me to write the following.If I know that this is my wave\nfunction at psi at x at time 0,so let's say in all these cases,\nthis is psi of x at time 0,how does this state\nevolve forward in time?It's kind of complicated.How does this description,\nhow does psi tilde of kevolve forward in time?Again, kind of complicated.But when expressed in terms\nof the energy eigenstates,the answer to how it\nevolves forward in timeis very simple, because\nI know that thisis a superposition, a\nlinear combination of stateswith definite energy.States with definite\nenergy evolve with a phase.And the Schrodinger\nequation is linear,so solutions of the\nSchrodinger equationevolve to become solutions\nof the Schrodinger equation.So how does this state\nevolve forward in time?It evolves forward with a phase,\ne to the minus i omega n t.One for every different\nterms in this sum.Cool?So we are going to harp\non energy functions,not because they're more moral,\nor more just, or more good,but because they're more\nconvenient for solving the timeevolution problem in\nquantum mechanics.So most of today is going\nto be about this expansionand qualitative features\nof energy eigenfunctions.Cool?OK.And just to close\nthat out, I justwant to remind you of\na couple of examplesthat we did last time,\njust get them on board.So the first is a free particle.So for free particle, we have\nthat our wave functions--", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "well, actually let me\nnot write that down.Actually, let me skip\nover the free particle,because it's so trivial.Let me just talk about\nthe infinite well.So the potential is\ninfinite out here,and it's 0 inside\nthe well, and itgoes from 0 to L. This is\njust my choice of notation.And the energy\noperator, as usual,is p squared upon\n2m plus u of x.You might say, where\ndid I derive this,and the answer is I\ndidn't derive this.I just wrote it down.It's like force in\nNewton's equations.You just declare some\nforce and you ask,what system does is model.So here's my system.It has what looks like a\nclassical kind of energy,except these are all operators.And the potential here is this\nguy, it's 0 between 0 and L,and it's infinite elsewhere.And as we saw last\ntime, the solutionsto the energy\neigenvalue equationare particularly simple.Phi sub n of x is\nequal to root properlynormalized 2 upon\nL sine of Kn x,where kn is equal to\nn plus 1 pi, wheren is an integer upon L.And these were chosen to\nsatisfy our boundary conditions,that the wave function must\nvanish here, hence the sine,and K was chosen so that it\nturned over and just hit 0as we got to L. And that gave us\nthat the allowed energies werediscrete, because the En, which\nyou can get by just plugginginto the energy\neigenvalue equation,was equal to h bar squared\nKn squared upon 2m.So this tells us a nice thing.First off, in this system,\nif I take a particleand I throw it in here\nin some arbitrary stateso that at time t\nequals zero the wavefunction x 0 is equal to\nsum over n phi n of x Cn.OK?Can I do this?Can I just pick some\narbitrary functionwhich is a superposition\nof energy eigenstates?", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Sure, because any function is.Any function can be\ndescribed as a superpositionof energy eigenfunctions.And if I use the\nenergy eigenfunctions,it will automatically satisfy\nthe boundary conditions.All good things will happen.So this is perfectly\nfine initial condition.What is the system at time t?Yeah, we just pick\nup the phases.And what phase is this guy?It's this, e to the\nminus i omega n t.And when I write omega n, let\nme be more explicit about that,that's En over h bar.So that's h bar Kn\nsquared upon 2m t.Cool?So there is our solution for\narbitrary initial conditionsto the infinite square well\nproblem in quantum mechanics.And you're going to study this\nin some detail on your problemset.But just to start with a\nlittle bit of intuition,let's look at the wave\nfunctions and the probabilitydistributions for the\nlowest lying states.So for example, let's\nlook at the wavefunction for the ground state,\nwhat I will call psi sub 0.And this is from 0 to L.\nAnd I put these bars herenot because we're\nlooking at the potential.I'm going to be plotting the\nreal part of the wave function.But I put these walls\nhere just to emphasizethat that's where the walls are,\nat x equals 0 and x equals L.So what does it look like?Well, the first one is\ngoing to sine of Kn x.n is 0.Kn is going to be pi upon L.\nSo that's again just this guy.Now, what's the\nprobability distributionassociated with psi 0?Where do you find the particle?So we know that it's just\nthe norm squared of this wavefunction and the norm\nsquared is here at 0, it's 0and it rises\nlinearly, because sineis linear for small values.That makes this\nquadratic, and a maximum,", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and then quadratic again.So there's our\nprobability distribution.Now, here's a funny thing.Imagine I take a particle,\nclassical particle,and I put it in a box.And you put it in a box,\nand you tell it, OK, it'sgot some energy.So classically it's\ngot some momentum.So it's sort of\nbouncing back and forthand just bounces off the\narbitrarily hard wallsand moves around.Where are you most likely\nto find that particle?Where does it spend\nmost of its time?It spends the same amount\nof time at any point.It's moving at\nconstant velocity.It goes boo, boo,\nboo, boo, right?So what's the\nprobability distributionfor finding it at any\npoint inside, classically?Constant.Classically, the probability\ndistribution is constant.You're just as likely\nto find it near the wallas not near the wall.However, quantum mechanically,\nfor the lowest lyingstate that is clearly not true.You're really likely to\nfind it near the wall.What's up with that?So that's a question that\nI want to put in your headand have you think about.You're going to see a similar\neffect arising over and over.And we're going to\nsee at the very endthat that is directly related,\nthe fact that this goes to 0,is directly related,\nand I'm not kidding,to the transparency of diamond.OK, I think it was pretty cool.They're expensive.It's also related\nto the transparencyof cubic zirconium, which\nI guess is less impressive.So the first state,\nagain, let's lookat the real part of psi 1,\nthe first excited state.Well, this is now a\nsine with one extra--with a 2 here, 2 pi,\nso it goes through 0.So the probability distribution\nassociated with psi 1,and I should say write this\nas a function of x, lookslike, well, again,\nit's quadratic.But it has a 0\nagain in the middle.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So it's going to look like--oops, my bad art defeats me.OK, there we go.So now it's even worse.Not only is unlikely\nto be out here,it's also very unlikely\nto be found in the middle.In fact, there is 0 probability\nyou'll find it in the middle.That's sort of surprising.But you can quickly\nguess what happens as yougo to very high energies.The real part of psi n let's\nsay 10,000, 10 to the 4,what is that going to look like?Well, this had no\n0s, this had one 0,and every time you\nincrease n by 1,you're just going to add\none more 0 to the sign.That's an interesting\nand suggestive fact.So if it's size of\n10,000, how many nodesare there going to be in\nthe middle of the domain?10,000.And the amplitude is\ngoing to be the same.I'm not to be able to do\nthis, but you get the idea.And now if I construct the\nprobability distribution,what's the probability\ndistribution going to be?Probability of the 10,000th\npsi sub 10 to the 4 of x.Well, it's again going\nto be strictly positive.And if you are not able to make\nmeasurements on the scale of Lupon 10,000, but just say like\nL over 3, because you havea thumb and you don't have an\ninfinitely accurate meter, whatdo you see?You see effectively a constant\nprobability distribution.And actually, I\nshouldn't draw it there.I should draw it\nthrough the half,because sine squared over\n2 averages to one half,or, sorry, sine squared averages\nto one half over many periods.So what we see is that\nthe classical probabilitydistribution constant\ndoes arise when we lookat very high energy states.Cool?But it is manifestly\nnot a good description.The classical description\nis not a good description.Your intuition is\ncrappy at low energies,near the ground state, where\nquantum effects are dominating,because indeed, classically\nthere was no minimum energy.Quantum effects have\nto be dominating there.And here we see that even the\nprobability distribution'sradically different\nthan our intuition.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Yeah.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Keep

answer is--I like the suspense.There we go.B, good.So here's a quick question.So why?And the reason why is that if\nwe have E on psi 1 plus psi 2,this is equal to E on psi 1 plus\nE on psi 2,

energies is 0.Does this only happen if you\nhave something that's infinite?PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's\na really good question.So first off, how do\nyou measure an energy?Do you ever measure an energy?Do you ever measure a\nvoltage, the actual valueof the scalar potential,\nthe electromagnetic scalarpotential?No.You measure a difference.Do you ever measure the energy?No, you measure a\ndifference in energy.So the absolute value of energy\nis sort of a silly thing.But we always talk\nabout it as if it's not.We say, that's got energy 14.It's a little bit suspicious.So to answer your\nquestion, there's", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "nothing hallowed\nabout the number 0,although we will often\nrefer to zero energywith a very specific meaning.What we really mean\nin that case isthe

energy 0?Absolutely, and we'll see that.And it's actually going to\nbe really interesting what'strue of states with\nenergy 0 in that sense.Second part of your\nquestion, though,is how does energy\nbeing 0 fit into this?Well, does that save us?Suppose one of\nthe energies is 0.Then that says E on psi\n1 plus psi 2 is equal to,let's say E2 is 0.Well, that term is gone.So there's just the one E1.Are we in energy eigenstate?No, because it's\nstill not of the formE times psi 1 plus psi 2.So it doesn't save us, but\nit's an interesting questionfor the future.All right.Next question, four

you.It's got some wiggles,\nand then a big wiggle,and then it's got a\nbig wiggle, and then--", "start": 3360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "do I want to do that?Yeah, let's do that.Then a big wiggle, and\nsomething like this.And someone shows\nyou this potential.And they say, look, what are\nthe energy eigenfunctions?Well, OK, free\nparticle was easy.The infinite square\nwell was easy.We could solve\nthat analytically.The next involved solving\na differential equation.So what differential equation\nis this going to lead us to?Well, we know that the\nenergy eigenvalue equationis minus h bar\nsquared upon 2 m phiprime prime of x plus U of x\nphi x, so that's the energyoperator acting on\nphi, is equal to,saying that it's an energy\neigenfunction, phi sub E,says that it's equal\nto the energy operatoracting on this eigenfunction\nis just a constant E phi subE of x.And I'm going to work\nat moment in time,so we're going to drop all the\nt dependence for the moment.So this is the\ndifferential equationwe need to solve where U of\nx is this god-awful function.Do you think it's very\nlikely that you'regoing to be able to\nsolve this analytically?Probably not.However, some basic\nideas will helpyou get an intuition for\nwhat the wave function shouldlook like.And I cannot overstate the\nimportance of being ableto eyeball a system and guess\nthe qualitative features of itswave functions,\nbecause that intuition,that ability to estimate, is\ngoing to contain an awful lotof physics.So let's try to extract it.So in order to do\nso, I want to startby massaging this\nequation into a form whichis particularly convenient.So in particular, I'm going to\nwrite this equation as phi subE prime prime.So what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to take this term,I'm going to notice this\nhas two derivatives,this has no derivatives,\nthis has no derivatives.And I'm going to move this\nterm over here and combinethese terms into E\nminus U of x, and I'm", "start": 3480.0,

than\nwhat I've just written down.But what is the second\nderivative of function?It's telling you not its\nslope, but it's telling youhow the slope changes.It's telling about the\ncurvature of the function.And what this is telling me is\nsomething very, very useful.So for example, let's\nlook at the function.Let's assume that\nthe function is real,although we know in\ngeneral it's not.Let's assume that the function\nis real for simplicity.So we're going to plot\nthe real part of phiin the vertical axis.And this is x.Suppose the real part of phi\nis positive at some point.Phi prime prime,\nif it's positive,tells us that not only\nis the slope positive,but it's increasing.Or it doesn't tell us\nanything about the slope,but it tells us that whatever\nthe slope, it's increasing.If it's negative, the slope is\nincreasing as we increase x.If it's positive, it's\nincreasing as we increase x.So it's telling us that the\nwave function looks like this,locally, something like that.If phi is negative,\nif phi is negative,then if this\nquantity is positive,then phi prime prime\nhas to be negative.But negative is curving down.So if this quantity, which\nI will call the curvature,if this quantity is positive,\nit curves away from the axis.", "start": 3600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So this is phi prime prime\nover phi greater than 0.If this quantity is\npositive, the

positive,it curves away from the axis.If the curvature is negative,\nif this quantity is negative,it curves towards the axis.So what does that tell you about\nsolutions when the curvature ispositive

the\ncurvature is smaller.And the second is the\namplitude gets larger,because it keeps on having\na positive slope for longerand longer, and it takes\nlonger to curve back down.So here we have\nrapid

I want to emphasize.But the second thing,\nis there somethingbad about this wave function?Yes, you've already named it.What's bad about\nthis wave function?It's badly non-normalizable.It diverges off to infinity\nout here and out here.What does that tell you?It's not physical.Good.What else does it tell\nyou about this system?Sorry?Excellent.Is this an allowable energy?No.If the wave function\nhas this energy,it is impossible to\nmake it continuous,assuming that I\ndrew it correctly,and have it converge.Is this wave function allowable?No, because it does not satisfy\nour boundary conditions.Our boundary conditions are that\nthe wave function must vanishout here and it must\nvanish out here at infinityin order to be normalizable.Here we failed.Now, you can imagine\nthat-- so let's decreasethe energy a little bit.If we decrease the energy,\nour trial energy just a littletiny bit, what happens?Well, that's going to decrease\nthe curvature in here.We decrease, we bring the energy\nin just a little tiny bit.", "start": 4320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "That means this is a\nlittle bit smaller.The potential stays the same.So the curvature in\nthe allowed regionis just a little\ntiny bit smaller.And meanwhile,\nthe allowed regionhas got just a\nlittle bit thinner.And what that will do is the\ncurvature's a little less,the region's a little\nless, so now we have--Sorry, I get excited.And if we tweak the energy,\nwhat's going to happen?Well, it's going to arrive\nhere a little bit sooner.And let's imagine\nsomething like this.And if we chose the\nenergy just right,we would get it to match\nto a linear combinationof collapsing and\ngrowing exponentials,where the contribution from\nthe growing exponentialin this direction vanishes.There's precisely one\nvalue of the energythat lets me do that with\nthis number of wiggles.And so then it goes\nthrough and does its thing.And we need it to\nhappen on both sides.Now if I take that solution,\nso that it achieves convergenceout here, and it achieves\nconvergence out here,and I take that energy and\nI increase it by epsilon,by just the tiniest little bit,\nwhat will happen to this wavefunction?It'll diverge.It will no longer\nbe normalizable.When you have classically\nforbidden regions,are the allowed energies\ncontinuous or discrete?And that answers a question\nfrom earlier in the class.And it also is going\nto be the beginningof the answer to the question,\nwhy is the spectrum of hydrogendiscrete.See you next time.", "start": 4440.0, "heat": 0.1}]
