right.So we're continuing on now\nwith molecular orbital theory,and we started the course\ntalking about atomic structureand then we talked about atomic\norbitals or wave functions.And then we moved on to bonding,\nthat atoms can come togetherand bond and talked about\nthe structure of molecules,and now we're going\nto molecular orbitals.And then we'll also talk\nmore about the structureof molecules based on\nthose molecular orbitalson Wednesday.So we're really coming\nall the way around,we're using a lot of the\nideas that you've seen before,but now we're applying\nthem to

ideathat these valence\nelectrons are reallygoing to be delocalized\naround these moleculesand not just sitting\non individual atoms.So to think about this\nelectron do localization,we need to think about\nmolecular orbitals.Molecular orbitals,\nas we've learned,another word for orbital\nis also wave functions.Wave functions are orbitals.Orbitals are wave functions.You need to consider\nthe wavelike propertiesof electrons to think about\nwhere the electrons are goingto be, what is their\nprobability density,how are they going\nto be arrangedwith respect to the nucleus.And so when we take\natomic orbitalsand we bring them together\nas atoms come togetherto form bonds, atomic\norbitals come togetherto form molecular orbitals.So we're going to be adding\nsuperimposing, atomic orbitalsto form these\nmolecular orbitals.And this is called a linear\ncombination of atomic orbitals,or LCAO.And so we're going to bring\nthose atomic orbitals togetherand create molecular orbitals.And we're going to create two\ntypes of molecular orbitals.We're going to create\nbonding and antibonding.And some basic math\nprinciples apply here,and that is that you can\ncreate N

first we'll talk\nabout bonding orbitals.So bonding orbitals,\nagain, arisefrom this linear combination\nof atomic orbitals, the LCAO.And if it's a\nbonding orbital, it'sgoing to arise from\nconstructive interference.So we talked before about the\nproperties of waves, and oneof the great\nproperties of waves isthat they can constructively\ninterfere, destructivelyinterfere.And orbitals are wave functions\nso they can constructivelyinterfere and\ndestructively interfere.Bonding orbitals\nare generated bythe constructive interference.So let's look at\ntwo atomic orbitals.And so here we have an orbital.The nucleus is in the middle.It's a little dot.It's a nucleus.And these two atomic orbitals\nare going to come together.There's going to\nbe a bonding event.And so we have a 1s\norbital from atom aand a 1s orbital from\natom b, and they'regoing to come\ntogether, and they'regoing to form a\nmolecular orbital,an ab molecular orbital,\nand this is called sigma 1s.So a sigma orbital is\nsymmetric around the bond axis,so the bond axis here would\nbe just a vertical, a linebetween these two nuclei here.And so this molecular orbital\nis symmetric around that bondaxis.There are no nodal planes for\nsomething that is symmetric.There are no nodal planes\nfor our s orbitals,and so there's none for the\nmolecular orbital either.And we can also write\nthis as 1sa plus 1sb.",

the\nsame equation up here.We're bringing\ntogether 1sa and 1sb,but now let's think about\nthis as a wave function.So there is an\namplitude associatedwith the wave function\nfor 1sa, and thereis an

I'm going to put the\nbonding orbital at a lowerenergy level.First, I was going to\nput the electrons on,and now, I'm going to put the\norbital at a lower energy.So remember, this is\nincreasing energy here,so the atomic orbitals\nwould be up here,whereas the molecular\norbital is down here.The molecular bonding orbital\nwill be lower in energy.And now we'll put\nour electrons there.So we have one electron\nup here and one here,and so when they\ncome together, we'regoing to have two electrons\nin this molecular orbital.So when you have\nthese two electronsand they both occupy\nthe

here is our B2 diagram.So now let's try the same\nthing for carbon, C2,and that is a clicker question.", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.266}, {"text": "All right.Let's just take 10 more seconds.So let's

have\nput two up here.Then you would have put\none here, one there,another one there,\nand another one there.So now we have used these\nup, and so our configurationis sigma 2s 2, sigma star\n2, pi 2px

they'llbe a simple question what is\nthe bond order, but to get thereyou have to draw your whole\nmolecular orbital diagramand figure out how many bonding\nand how many antibonding,so these are not really\nthat fast questions.And it's nice.", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.397}, {"text": "Sometimes we give you\nlike a little space,and you see this whole little\nmolecular orbital diagramfit in there to\nanswer the question.All right.So let's just compare these\ntwo diagrams for a minute.So in both cases, we had 2s\norbitals, two atomic orbitalsfor 2s, and they both generated\ntwo molecular orbitals,a bonding and an antibonding.The bonding is lower in\nenergy, and the antibondingis higher in energy.We also had two 2px\natomic orbitals.They generated 2\npi 2 px orbitals,one bonding, one antibonding.And the same for our two\natomic orbitals for 2 py.We had two of those, and they\ngenerated one lower energybonding, pi, bonding and\none pi star antibonding.So you always have N\natomic orbitals generatingN molecular orbitals.So the stability of\nthe resulting moleculesin these cases depend on\nhow many of the electronsare bonding, how many\nare in energy loweras a result of formation\nof the molecule,and how many are at higher\nenergy as a result of formationof the molecule.And if the net result are more\nelectrons in lower energy, moreelectrons in bonding\norbitals, then that moleculeis more stable.If there's a very\nslight or no difference,then that's not a\nvery stable molecule.So now let's just\ncompare these twoand think about which of these\nis going to be more stable.So we have our\nconfigurations again.So in the case of B2,\nhow many electronsare in lower energy\nor bonding orbitals?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah,\nwe have four-- 1, 2, 3, 4.How many in higher?", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.222}, {"text": "AUDIENCE: Two.CATHERINE DRENNAN: Two.Up here.For carbon, we had six-- 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6-- two in higher.And so the bond order here was\n1, the bond order here was 2.Which is more stable?Higher dissociation energy,\nwhich one do you think?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].CATHERINE DRENNAN: Carbon.Right.Has a bond order of two.It has more electrons in\nlower energy orbitals.So it cannot really well\nout of this bonding deal,and the dissociation energy for\nB2, 289, whereas, for C2, 599.So when molecules come together\nsuch that more of the electronsare in lower energy\nor bonding orbitals,you form a nice,\nstable molecule.When molecules come\ntogether such that moreof their electrons are an\nantibonding or higher energy,that's not a happy molecule.So I'll just and with one\nway to think about this.In this cartoon\nmolecular, break up lines,sometimes two atoms just\nhave an incompatible numberof valence electrons.And there are just too many--\njust here this molecule saying,I'm sorry.Too many of your electrons\nare in my antibonding regions.I don't know how many\ntimes we've all heard that,but it's time to dissociate,

minute.You can hear the answer.So this one is true.The second one is not true.A bond order of zero\ndoesn't mean that you justhave antibonding orbitals.Whenever you bring together\ntwo atomic orbitals,you have to make two\nmolecular orbitals.So it isn't that sometimes\nyou make bonding orbitalsand sometimes you make\nantibonding orbitals.Every time you bring\ntogether two atomic orbitals,you make two molecular orbitals,\none that's lower in energy,and that's the bonding\norbital, and onethat's higher in energy, and\nthat's the antibonding orbital.So that is not what that means.A bond order of\nzero means that youhave equal numbers of electrons\nin your bonding and antibondingorbitals.So there's no net stabilization\ndue to the formationof these bonds.So here bonding occurs\nwhen you bring togethertwo atomic orbitals to make\ntwo molecular orbitals thatare both of lower energy.No.Every time you make the two\norbitals, one is lower energy,one is higher that energy.You can't make two that\nare both lower in energy.And bond order of 1 means\nconstructive interferenceis generated at one\nbonding orbital.That's not what a\nbond order of 1 is.", "start":

axis.All right.So we had these diagrams\nfor boron and carbon,just talking about the\ninteractions of the px and py,and so we had\nforgotten about our pz.And you can't do that on a test.You get into trouble,\nso I'm alwaystelling people for\nthese two handouts,you must include the\nmolecular orbitals thatare derived from p to z.So on a test, you need to put\nthem even if they're empty.Even if they don't\nhave anything in them,they need to be part of your\nmolecular orbital diagram.We didn't have\nthem in the diagrambecause we hadn't\ntalked about them yet,so now we're going\nto talk about them.So two pz orbitals, again,\nthis is on Monday's handout.You have this linear\ncombination of atomic orbitals.And all are p orbitals.They all look the\nsame as each other,they're just different\nin orientation.You have one along x,\none along y, one along z,but they're the same.So now we're going to bring\nour two pz orbitals together,and we're going to do it\nalong the bonding axis.So we've defined this as the\nbonding axis in the class,so we'll bring them\ntogether, and they'llbe constructive interference\nwith our bonding orbitals.There's always constructive\ninterference thatgenerates bonding orbitals.And so we're going to create a\nenhanced amplitude as the wavefunctions come\ntogether, and it'sgoing to be\ncylindrically symmetric.So what type of orbital do\nyou think this is going to be,", "start": 2880.0, "heat": 0.411}, {"text": "sigma or pi?AUDIENCE: Sigma.CATHERINE DRENNAN:\nIt'll be sigmabecause it's\ncylindrically symmetric.So we do not have any bonding\nplane along the bond axis,and it's symmetric around.And we have enhanced\nprobability density,and we have the wave\nfunction squaredenhanced probability of having\nan electron between the twonuclei.And so this is a sigma 2pz.So p orbitals can form\nsigma molecular orbitals.So we do have nodes\npassing through our nuclei.Here are our nuclei again.We do have them.They were here before\nin our p orbitals.There's the nodal plane in our\np orbitals, but we do not have,in this case, a node\nalong the bond axis.So that is our bonding.So whenever you generate\na bonding orbital, whichis going to be\nlower energy, we'regoing to have our increased\namplitude between the nuclei,again, our increased probability\ndensity and therefore,lower energy.So whenever you have\nconstructive interferencegenerating a molecular\norbital of lower energy,you got to create\nsomething of higher energy.That's just how life works.So we also are going\nto have antibondingorbitals, which are generated\nby destructive interference.And again, these\norbitals can be thoughtabout as wave functions,\nand a property of wavesis that they constructively\ninterfere and destructivelyinterfere.So now we can subtract\nour two orbitals,which we're going\nto switch the signand they're going\nto be out of phase.So they'll\ndestructively interfere,and that's going\nto

2pz star,\nso it's an antibonding orbital.So again, it's\nsigma, so it's stillcylindrically symmetrical with\nno nodal plane along that bondaxis, but you do have a new\nnodal plane that's generated.So nodes pass, again,\nthrough the nuclei,but also now between\nthese two orbitals.So we have a new\nnodal plane that'sgenerated that's\nbetween these nuclei,and that's a result of\ndestructive

go\nback to our MO diagramsand figure out where to put\nthese new molecular orbitalsonto our nice diagrams.And it's not as simple as\nit was before because wherewe put these new sigma 2pz\nmolecular
