[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Hello, I'm Linan.Welcome to the recitation\nof Linear Algebra.It's my great\npleasure to guide youthrough the first recitation.In the first lecture, we\nlearned some important concepts.We discussed how to view a\nlinear system of equationsfrom different points.And we discussed the concepts\nsuch as row picture, columnpicture, and the form in matrix.Some of them may be new to you.So today, we're going to\nuse this simple exampleto review those concepts.We're going to work with\nthis simple system of twoequations with two unknowns.So I would like you\nto first solve it,and then to find out the\nassociated row pictureand column picture\nwith this system.After you're done,\nwe're also goingto discuss the matrix form\nof this linear system.Why don't you pause\nthe video now and tryto work them out on your own.A good suggestion\nwould be, you cantry to sketch your answer in\nan xy coordinate like this.OK, I'll see you in a while.I hope you have just\nhad some fun with it.Let's work on it together.Well, we're going to\nsolve these equations.As you can see, we have\ntwo unknowns, x and y.And they have to satisfy these\ntwo equations at the same time.How would you solve it?A very simple way would\nbe you substitute x by y,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.18}, {"text": "in terms of y.So let's do it this way.So we use the second equation\nto rewrite x as 2y minus 1.So 2y minus 1.Then you plug this into\nthe first equation.This implies twice-- x would\nbe replaced by this-- 2 times2y minus 1 plus y is equal to 3.When you simplify\nthis equation here,you will arrive at that\n5y minus 2 is equal to 3.That simply tells\nyou y is equal to 1.If y is equal to 1, then\nwe go back to this formula.We see that x is\nalso equal to 1.That's it.This is the answer to\nthis linear system.And it's easy enough.Both x and y are 1.Now, let's try to find out its\nrow picture and column picture.So I'm going to work on\nthis xy coordinate here.First, let's look\nat row picture.Please review what\na row picture is.So by row picture,\nI mean you haveto look at this linear\nsystem according to each row.So what is the first row?Well, the first row is an\nequation with two unknowns.So 2 times x plus\ny is equal to 3.What is this equation, exactly?", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.105}, {"text": "As you may remember,\nthis equationactually gives you a\nstraight line in xy-plane.So now let's put the line here.I want a line that\nsatisfies 2x plus y is 3.Let's first set x to be 0.If x is 0, by the\nfirst equation,y should be 3, which is here.Now, let's set x to be 1.If x is 1, then y is also 1.So what I have now are\ntwo points on the line.And this is enough,\nbecause on the xy-plane,two points will uniquely\ndetermine a straight line.And that's the line\nwe're looking for.So all we need to do is to\nconnect these two points.Let me try to draw\nthis line straight.So this is the\nline that is givenby 2x plus y is equal to 3.This is the easiest way\nto determine a line.You just need to pick two\npoints that are on the line.Then you connect them, and here\nyou have the straight line.So that's the first row.Now let's look at\nthe second row.The second row is x\nminus 2y is equal to -1.Same thing.We're going to locate two\npoints on the second line.So again, let's set\nx to be 0 first.If x is 0, then y\nshould be 1/2, right?So this line has to\ncross this point.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "That's x, 0; y, 1/2.Then let's put x to be 1 again.So if x is 1, then y is also 1.So we're going to use\nthe same point here.Now we have two points in the\nsecond line to connect them.So by connecting them, I will\nhave my second straight line.So this is the line\ncorresponding to x minus 2yis -1.This is the row\npicture, because wehave separated\nthe two equations,and we look at\nthem respectively.The first equation\ngives me this line,and the second equation\ngives me this line.Then what do I mean by\nsolving this linear system?Well, we are putting\nthese two lines together,and we are looking\nat a point whichis on the first line and\nsecond line at the same time.Then clearly, that's the point\nwhere they intersect, right?We can see from the\nanswer over there,the coordinate of this\npoint should be (1, 1).This is also clear from the\nconstruction of the two lines.We have noticed\nthat this point ison the first line and the\nsecond line at the same time.Two lines meeting\nat the point (1, 1).That's the row picture\nof this linear system.Now, let's move on to\nthe column picture.Again, I will need\nan xy coordinate.So, where can I find my columns?", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "If you look at\nthe two equations,then you focus on the\ncoefficient in frontof x in both equations.What would that be?Well, in the first equation,\nI have a 2 in front of x.In the second equation,\nI have a 1 in front of x.I want to put them together\nas a column vector.Let me call it v_1.And I'm going to do the same\nthing to the coefficientsin front of y.In the first equation, I\nhave a 1 in front of y.In the second equation, I\nhave a -2 in front of y.Put them together.Call it a column vector v_2.These are the columns\nI'm looking for.Then what does that\nlinear system say?Well, I have extracted the\ncoefficients in front of x.Now I can consider x to be the\ncoefficient of this vector.And same thing,\nI'm going to view yas the coefficient\nof this vector.Then what that linear system is\ndoing is just to sum them up.That gives you the left-hand\nside of the linear system.What is the right-hand side?Again, you put the two\nconstants as a columnvector, which is [3, -1].That is the right-hand side.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So what I'm doing here is I'm\ntaking the linear combinationof v_1 and v_2.And the coefficients are given\nby x and y, respectively.And I want the result of this\ncombination to be [3, -1].Now let's incorporate\nthis into this picture.I have a v_1, so I'm going\nto draw a vector v_1.x is 2, y is 1, so v_1 is here.That's v_1.And I need a v_2.x is 1.y is -2.So that's my v_2.I want to take the sum\nof x multiple of v_1and y multiple of v_2.And I want the result\nto be [3,  -1].Well, taking a hint from\nthe previous consideration,we know that both x\nand y should be 1.So I'm actually summing one\ncopy of v_1 and one copy of v_2.So how do you indicate the\nsum of these two vectors?You complete the parallelogram\nspanned by these two vectors.Then the vector\ngiven by the diagonalis the sum of v_1 and v_2.Is this vector going\nto be [3,  -1]?Well, we can check.The x-coordinate will\nbe 2 plus 1, which is 3.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "That's 2 plus 1, 3.And the y-coordinate\nwill be 1 minus 2.So 1 minus 2,\nwhich should be -1.That's it.That's one multiple of v_1\nand one multiple of v_2.The sum will be [3, -1].And that's the row picture.Where does that that \"x is equal\nto y is equal to 1\" come from?It comes from solving\nthe linear system.It comes from the row picture.So here, we have found out\nthe row picture and the columnpicture of this linear system.What I would like to\nmention is the matrix formof this linear system.So what is the matrix form?What if I put these two\ncolumn vectors together?So I want to put them\nback to back, v_1 and v_2.And I call this matrix to be\nA. So if you write it out,A should be given\nby 2, 1; 1, -2.Matrix A has v_1 and v_2\nas its column vectors,and it's a 2-by-2 matrix.If I consider-- if I take\nthis into account, thenwhat will be the left-hand\nside of the linear system?In other words, what would\nbe the left-hand sideof this equation?This is actually matrix\nA multiplying a vector", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.111}, {"text": "given by x, y.So that's [2, 1; 1, -2]\nmultiplying x and y.So you put both unknowns\ntogether as a column vector.That's the left-hand\nside of the equation.And again, the\nright-hand side is givenby this column vector, [3; -1].This is the matrix form\nof this linear system.We can actually\nsolve this directly.In other words, we can get\nthis unknown vector at once,both x-coordinate\nand y-coordinate.Let's recall, if you have a\nscalar equation like this--let's say a is some\nconstant times x is unknownis equal to b.If a is non-zero,\nwhat would be x?So clearly, x\nshould be b over a.I can also write it\nas a inverse times b.That's what we do\nwhen we have numbers.So here, what we\nwant to apply isa similar idea but to matrix.What you want to\nfind is a matrixA inverse such that\nA inverse times Ais equal to an identity\nmatrix, which is [1, 0; 0, 1].This may be new to you,\nbut as you go furtherinto this course, this idea will\nbecome more and more natural.If such an inverse\nmatrix exists, thenwhat would be this vector here?Then [x; y] will simply be\nA inverse times [3; -1].", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.302}, {"text": "That will give you the answer.Here, I'm not going\nto go into detail,but we will return to\nthis later in this course.I hope this simple\nexample is helpful to youin reviewing what you've\nlearned in the lecture.Thank you for watching,\nand I'm looking forwardto seeing you again.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.372}]
