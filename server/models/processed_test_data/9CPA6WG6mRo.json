adequately.Welcome back.It's Tuesday.For those of you who are not\nin my recitation section,I'm Dave Gossard, and I'll\nbe your lecturer for the day.Professor Vandiver\nis out of town.It looks like some of\nyou may be as well.We probably could have held this\nat the gate at Logan Airportand done a little better.But be that as it\nmay, glad you came.This should be fun.Today we have a new topic\nand a demonstration,a real physical system.So unless there are any\noutstanding questions?Anybody have any\nquestions or complaintsto address to Vicente?No.All right, hearing none let's\ngo ahead and get started then.Today the topic is multiple\ndegree of freedom systems.Now to date, with a\ncouple of exceptions,all of the systems\nthat you've dealt withhad a single degree of freedom,\neither a linear displacementx or an angular\ndisplacement theta.You know the concept\nof equations of motion,or I should say the\nequation of motionand the notion of undamped\nnatural frequency.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Well, today we're going to\ngeneralize, if you will,to systems that have not one\nbut multiple degrees of freedomand see how those\nnotions generalize.In particular, as\nyou might expect,the system that has\nmultiple degrees of freedomhas multiple natural\nfrequencies, alsoknown as eigenvalues as we\nwill explain here shortly.Multiple degrees\nof freedom systemshave a new property,\na new characteristicyou haven't seen before.And that's what this\nlecture is all about,is to illustrate that to\nyou and demonstrate it.It's the notion\nof natural modes,also called eigenvectors.And then the general response\nto initial conditions.So that is the plan for the day.And we'll start with this.This is kind of a\nclassic textbookcase, two springs, two masses.A straightforward extrapolation\nof what you've done before.You've got a spring K1,\nmass M1, spring K2, mass M2.And the displacements\nare indicatedas shown there, X1 and X2.I want to hasten to point out\nthat the displacements we speakof here are defined with respect\nto the static equilibrium", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.128}, {"text": "position.This is a notion that Professor\nVandiver went over at leastonce.And for those of you who've\nforgotten it or weren't therethat day, I have for you a\nreference, essentially reprisedthat notion over there.So in the meantime,\nlet me press on.If you have any questions, we\ncan go back and cover that.But assuming you agree, let\nme simply say you've gottwo springs, two masses.The typical way we've\ntaught you to doit is if you're\ngoing to generatethe equations of motion\nby the direct method,you generate two free\nbody diagrams, the sumforces in the x direction\nfor each of the masses,get f equals MA and\nyou'd get these.Conversely, you could\nalso do it by Legrange.You could generate\nthe expressionfor the kinetic energy,\nfor the potential energy,for the Legrangian, do this\nLagrange equation business,and you'd get the same thing.But either way you do it,\nwhat comes out the other sidelooks like this.And it's not a bad exercise\nfor you to offline convinceyourself that this is right.Not right now, but in\nthe comfort and leisureof another time.So there you have it.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.157}, {"text": "That's what the two equations\nof motion would look like.Again, either by the direct\nmethod or by Legrange,you end up in the same\nplace, so to speak.And now for today, we haven't\nasked you to do this much,but let me simply say\nthe weapon of choicefor multiple degrees\nof freedom system,because there's a certain\nrepetitive quality to it,matrix notation is preferred.In these equations over\nhere, written in matrix formwould look like this.And that looks like this.There's two matrices,\nand let me hastento point out that this is\nexactly this and nothing more.There's no magic, no\nadditional derivation.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.219}, {"text": "This is simply a restructuring,\nand reorganizationof these equations.And this may seem\nforeign to thoseof you who have not had any\nor very much linear algebra.Do not be dismayed.It is not a difficult\nthing to learn.As you probably know, a matrix\nmultiplies by a vector--or multiplying a\nvector by a matrix--is done with two hands.The first item for example\nis M1 X1 dot plus 0.That gives you this\nterm right here.Over here you get\nX1 times K1 plus K2.That's this one.And here you have minus\nK2 X2, that's that term.So matrix notation,\nthis becomes that.No problem.It's like a model train set.It's great.Everyone should\nhave one of these.All right, so what I would\nlike to do for our example hereis because we're going\nto be doing some algebra,for the express purpose of\nsimplifying the algebra letme consider a special case\nwhere the masses are identical.And we can simply call\nthem M. And similarly,the springs are identical,\nand we'll simply call them K.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.396}, {"text": "At that point, these\nequations become simplified.That's just M, that's\njust M. So thisis the problem we're\ngoing to-- we'regoing to tackle this problem\nfirst, because as I say,it simplifies the algebra.Now here is-- this\nis not an assumption.This is a-- I would call\nthis more a mechanismto get this job done here.Harmonic motion is\none where we assumethat the masses oscillate\nat the same frequency.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.304}, {"text": "So what this looks like is this.What we're basically saying\nis that X1 is actuallyequal-- X1 has\namplitude A-- whoa.I'm being attacked here\nby the second board.Basically, the situation\nhere is that we'reassuming that both\nof these massesmove-- I wouldn't call\nit exactly together.They're not in\ncomplete synchrony,as you'll see here in a moment.But what they are\nis they're goingthrough a sinusoidal motion.And it is an oscillation\nat the same frequency.Both of them are oscillating\nat the same frequency.However, they differ\nin their magnitudes.They are not the same magnitude.But that assumption right\nthere

squared.Where does that come from?AUDIENCE: The minus sign came\nfrom when you differentiatedthe cosine in the first one.PROFESSOR: Exactly.And the cosine returns.And that's what you get.Well, here is, shall we say,\nthe heart of the matter.When you substitute\nthis into this--let me call this-- I'll try not\nto get too obsessive over this.But these are our\nequations of motion.So when we--

for\nwriting this out,but I would like you\nto be able to do thisby yourself, to recreate\nthis after the fact.This becomes-- dividing\nand collecting terms.OK, anybody unclear about\nhow this is obtained?Yes, ma'am.Emma.AUDIENCE: I have a question\nabout the previous one.PROFESSOR: Yeah?AUDIENCE: If the second\nterm on the left hand side,should it also be\nmultiplied by A1 A2?PROFESSOR: Yes

be a minus?PROFESSOR: I'm sorry,\nthat's absolutely correct.Wonderful.So there we have it.Any other questions?I hope I got it right.Yes sir.AUDIENCE: Are they plus K?PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?AUDIENCE: Are they plus K?PROFESSOR: Plus K?No.They're minus.Yeah, why is that?Everybody see that?This is a straight-- there's\nless here than meets the eye.There's a straight segregation\ncollecting of terms.The minus got added to the\nelements of the mass matrix,but not to the K metrics.The K metrics goes\nshows through as is.Now, the question on the\nfloor is what we do with this?Can everybody

side\nhas got system parameter, Ksand Ms, and stuff like that.But this is the ringer, omega.This amplitude ratio\nis expressed in partin terms of omega.So what omega-- there's no\nambiguity as to Ks and Ms,but what omega?Well the answer is, when\nwe plug in this one,you get this answer.When you plug-in this\none, you get this answer.So while we're at it-- Sara,\nwant to hazard a guess?How many

years ago here,I believe, at MIT by people who\nwere into matrices, into matrixalgebra.And it's kind of\ncommand line oriented.The good news,\nit's very powerful.Whatever you want to do,\nyou can do in MATLAB.The bad news is, the\nuser interface stinks.The language is very\ndifficult to learn.It's even harder to remember.So with that\nrousing endorsement,let me show you\nwhat we've got here.This

to you\nwhat it does as we go.Let me see if my little\ncursor-- my cursor's here,but I can't see it.All right, here's the\nsystem parameters.Once again, we're doing\na simple spring mass--this

values are equal.We've got the mass\nat one kilogram each.And we've got 10 newtons per\nmeter on each of the springs.Everybody appreciate that\nthis system's numbersthat we're putting in here\nmatch our case here, K over M?OK.And you can see\nhere, we've defined--and again, let me\njust say I'm nottrying to sell you on MATLAB.I don't want to leave\nyou with the impressionthat we expect you to be\nable to instantly becomea user of MATLAB.This is simply to illustrate\nthe point of the lecture here.Here is the M,\nthe system matrix.There's the K matrix.And I'll show you the eigenvalue\nand
