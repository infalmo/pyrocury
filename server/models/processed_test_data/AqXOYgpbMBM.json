[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Hi there.Welcome back to recitation.In lecture, you've been learning\nabout when vectors are linearlyindependent, when they span\nthe space, what a basis is,what a dimension of\na vector space is.And the problem for today\nis exactly about that.We have a vector\nspace that is given.It's spanned by\nthese four vectors.And we're asked to find the\ndimension of that vector spaceand the basis for it.Well, why don't you hit pause\non the video, and work on itfor a while.And I'll come back in a little\nbit to help you out with it.We're back.Let's work on it.So we need to find the\ndimension and the basis.Remember what the dimension is?It's simply the\nnumber of vectorsin a basis for the vector space.So actually, the\nproblem is backwards.We want to find the\nbasis for the spacefirst, and then\nfind the dimension.I'll write \"first\"\nhere and \"second\" here.So we want to find a basis\nfor the vector space spannedby these four vectors.So you might be\ntempted to just saythat a basis for\nthis vector spaceis those four vectors, because\nthey span the vector space.But there's another thing\nthat a basis has to satisfy.And it is the elements\nof the basis haveto be linearly independent.We don't know that these are.So we have to check.How do we check\nthat four vectorsare linearly independent?Well, there's a couple\nof different ways.But here's what\nwe're going to do.We're going to put these\nvectors as rows of a matrix.And then we'll do elimination.And when we get to the end,\nthe rows that have pivots", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "are the independent ones.So let's do that.1, 1, -2, 0, -1;
