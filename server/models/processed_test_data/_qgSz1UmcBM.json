[{"text": "I'd like to introduce you\nto an emerging area of science,one that is still speculative\nbut hugely exciting,and certainly one\nthat's growing very rapidly.Quantum biology\nasks a very simple question:Does quantum mechanics --that weird and wonderful\nand powerful theoryof the subatomic world\nof atoms and moleculesthat underpins so much\nof modern physics and chemistry --also play a role inside the living cell?In other words: Are there processes,\nmechanisms, phenomenain living organisms\nthat can only be explainedwith a helping hand\nfrom quantum mechanics?Now, quantum biology isn't new;it's been around since the early 1930s.But it's only in the last decade or so\nthat careful experiments --in biochemistry labs,\nusing spectroscopy --have shown very clear, firm evidence\nthat there are certain specific mechanismsthat require quantum mechanics\nto explain them.Quantum biology brings together\nquantum physicists, biochemists,molecular biologists --\nit's a very interdisciplinary field.I come from quantum physics,\nso I'm a nuclear physicist.I've spent more than three decadestrying to get my head\naround quantum mechanics.One of the founders\nof quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr,said, If you're not astonished by it,\nthen you haven't understood it.So I sort of feel happy\nthat I'm still astonished by it.That's a good thing.But it means I study the very\nsmallest structures in the universe --the building blocks of reality.If we think about the scale of size,start with an everyday object\nlike the tennis ball,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "and just go down orders\nof magnitude in size --from the eye of a needle down to a cell,\ndown to a bacterium, down to an enzyme --you eventually reach the nano-world.Now, nanotechnology may be\na term you've heard of.A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.My area is the atomic nucleus,\nwhich is the tiny dot inside an atom.It's even smaller in scale.This is the domain of quantum mechanics,and physicists and chemists\nhave had a long timeto try and get used to it.Biologists, on the other hand,\nhave got off lightly, in my view.They are very happy with their\nballs-and-sticks models of molecules.(Laughter)The balls are the atoms, the sticks\nare the bonds between the atoms.And when they can't build them\nphysically in the lab,nowadays, they have\nvery powerful computersthat will simulate a huge molecule.This is a protein made up\nof 100,000 atoms.It doesn't really require much in the way\nof quantum mechanics to explain it.Quantum mechanics\nwas developed in the 1920s.It is a set of beautiful and powerful\nmathematical rules and ideasthat explain the world of the very small.And it's a world that's very different\nfrom our everyday world,made up of trillions of atoms.It's a world built\non probability and chance.It's a fuzzy world.It's a world of phantoms,where particles can also behave\nlike spread-out waves.If we imagine quantum mechanics\nor quantum physics, then,as the fundamental\nfoundation of reality itself,then it's not surprising that we sayquantum physics underpins\norganic chemistry.After all, it gives us\nthe rules that tell ushow the atoms fit together\nto make organic molecules.Organic chemistry,\nscaled up in complexity,gives us molecular biology,\nwhich of course leads to life itself.So in a way, it's sort of not surprising.It's almost trivial.You say, \"Well, of course life ultimately\nmust depend of quantum mechanics.\"", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.133}, {"text": "But so does everything else.So does all inanimate matter,\nmade up of trillions of atoms.Ultimately, there's a quantum levelwhere we have to delve into\nthis weirdness.But in everyday life,\nwe can forget about it.Because once you put together\ntrillions of atoms,that quantum weirdness\njust dissolves away.Quantum biology isn't about this.Quantum biology isn't this obvious.Of course quantum mechanics\nunderpins life at some molecular level.Quantum biology is about looking\nfor the non-trivial --the counterintuitive ideas\nin quantum mechanics --and to see if they do, indeed,\nplay an important rolein describing the processes of life.Here is my perfect example\nof the counterintuitivenessof the quantum world.This is the quantum skier.He seems to be intact,\nhe seems to be perfectly healthy,and yet, he seems to have gone around\nboth sides of that tree at the same time.Well, if you saw tracks like thatyou'd guess it was some\nsort of stunt, of course.But in the quantum world,\nthis happens all the time.Particles can multitask,\nthey can be in two places at once.They can do more than one thing\nat the same time.Particles can behave\nlike spread-out waves.It's almost like magic.Physicists and chemists have had\nnearly a centuryof trying to get used to this weirdness.I don't blame the biologistsfor not having to or wanting\nto learn quantum mechanics.You see, this weirdness is very delicate;and we physicists work very hard\nto maintain it in our labs.We cool our system down\nto near absolute zero,we carry out our experiments in vacuums,we try and isolate it\nfrom any external disturbance.That's very different from the warm,\nmessy, noisy environment of a living cell.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.144}, {"text": "Biology itself, if you think of\nmolecular biology,seems to have done very well\nin describing all the processes of lifein terms of chemistry --\nchemical reactions.And these are reductionist,\ndeterministic chemical reactions,showing that, essentially, life is made\nof the same stuff as everything else,and if we can forget about quantum\nmechanics in the macro world,then we should be able to forget\nabout it in biology, as well.Well, one man begged\nto differ with this idea.Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger,\nof Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat fame,was an Austrian physicist.He was one of the founders\nof quantum mechanics in the 1920s.In 1944, he wrote a book\ncalled \"What is Life?\"It was tremendously influential.It influenced Francis Crick\nand James Watson,the discoverers of the double-helix\nstructure of DNA.To paraphrase a description\nin the book, he says:At the molecular level,\nliving organisms have a certain order,a structure to them that's very differentfrom the random thermodynamic jostling\nof atoms and moleculesin inanimate matter\nof the same complexity.In fact, living matter seems to behave\nin this order, in a structure,just like inanimate matter\ncooled down to near absolute zero,where quantum effects\nplay a very important role.There's something special\nabout the structure -- the order --inside a living cell.So, Schr\u00f6dinger speculated that maybe\nquantum mechanics plays a role in life.It's a very speculative,\nfar-reaching idea,and it didn't really go very far.But as I mentioned at the start,in the last 10 years, there have been\nexperiments emerging,showing where some of these\ncertain phenomena in biologydo seem to require quantum mechanics.I want to share with you\njust a few of the exciting ones.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "This is one of the best-known\nphenomena in the quantum world,quantum tunneling.The box on the left shows\nthe wavelike, spread-out distributionof a quantum entity --\na particle, like an electron,which is not a little ball\nbouncing off a wall.It's a wave that has a certain probability\nof being able to permeatethrough a solid wall, like a phantom\nleaping through to the other side.You can see a faint smudge of light\nin the right-hand box.Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle\ncan hit an impenetrable barrier,and yet somehow, as though by magic,disappear from one side\nand reappear on the other.The nicest way of explaining it is\nif you want to throw a ball over a wall,you have to give it enough energy\nto get over the top of the wall.In the quantum world,\nyou don't have to throw it over the wall,you can throw it at the wall,\nand there's a certain non-zero probabilitythat it'll disappear on your side,\nand reappear on the other.This isn't speculation, by the way.We're happy -- well, \"happy\"\nis not the right word --(Laughter)we are familiar with this.(Laughter)Quantum tunneling\ntakes place all the time;in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines.The particles fuse together,and the Sun turns hydrogen\ninto helium through quantum tunneling.Back in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered\nthat quantum tunneling also takes placeinside living cells.Enzymes, those workhorses of life,\nthe catalysts of chemical reactions --enzymes are biomolecules that speed up\nchemical reactions in living cells,by many, many orders of magnitude.And it's always been a mystery\nhow they do this.Well, it was discoveredthat one of the tricks that enzymes\nhave evolved to make use of,is by transferring subatomic particles,\nlike electrons and indeed protons,from one part of a molecule\nto another via quantum tunneling.", "start":

been\ncarried out back in the 80s,particularly by a group\nin Berkeley, Judith Klinman.Other groups in the UK\nhave now also confirmedthat enzymes really do this.Research carried out by my group --so as I mentioned,\nI'm a nuclear physicist,but I've realized I've got these tools\nof using quantum mechanicsin atomic nuclei, and so can apply\nthose tools in other areas as well.One question we askedis whether quantum tunneling\nplays a role in mutations in DNA.Again, this is not a new idea;\nit goes all the way back to the early 60s.The two strands of DNA,\nthe double-helix structure,are held together by rungs;\nit's like a twisted ladder.And those rungs of the ladder\nare hydrogen bonds --protons, that act as the glue\nbetween the two strands.So if you zoom in, what they're doing\nis holding these large molecules --nucleotides -- together.Zoom in a bit more.So, this a computer simulation.The two white balls\nin the middle are protons,and you can see that\nit's a double hydrogen bond.One prefers to sit on one side;\nthe other, on the other sideof the two strands of the vertical lines\ngoing down, which you can't see.It can happen that\nthese two protons can hop over.Watch the two white balls.They can jump over to the other side.If the two strands of DNA then separate,\nleading to the process of replication,and the two protons\nare in the wrong positions,this can lead to a mutation.This has been known for half a century.The question is: How likely\nare they to do that,and if they do, how do they do it?Do they jump across,\nlike the ball going over the wall?Or can they quantum-tunnel across,\neven if they don't have enough energy?Early indications suggest that\nquantum tunneling can play a role here.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "We still don't know yet\nhow important it is;this is still an open question.It's speculative,but it's one of those questions\nthat is so importantthat if quantum mechanics\nplays a role in mutations,surely this must have big implications,to understand certain types of mutations,possibly even those that lead\nto turning a cell cancerous.Another example of quantum mechanics\nin biology is quantum coherence,in one of the most\nimportant processes in biology,photosynthesis: plants\nand bacteria taking sunlight,and using that energy to create biomass.Quantum coherence is the idea\nof quantum entities multitasking.It's the quantum skier.It's an object that behaves like a wave,so that it doesn't just move\nin one direction or the other,but can follow multiple pathways\nat the same time.Some years ago,\nthe world of science was shockedwhen a paper was published\nshowing experimental evidencethat quantum coherence\ntakes place inside bacteria,carrying out photosynthesis.The idea is that the photon,\nthe particle of light, the sunlight,the quantum of light\ncaptured by a chlorophyll molecule,is then delivered to what's called\nthe reaction center,where it can be turned into\nchemical energy.And in getting there,\nit doesn't just follow one route;it follows multiple pathways at once,to optimize the most efficient way\nof reaching the reaction centerwithout dissipating as waste heat.Quantum coherence taking place\ninside a living cell.A remarkable idea,and yet evidence is growing almost weekly,\nwith new papers coming out,confirming that this\ndoes indeed take place.My third and final example\nis the most beautiful, wonderful idea.It's also still very speculative,\nbut I have to share it with you.The European robin\nmigrates from Scandinaviadown to the Mediterranean, every autumn,", "start":

100 times weaker\nthan a fridge magnet,and yet it affects the chemistry --\nsomehow -- within a living organism.That's not in doubt --\na German couple of ornithologists,Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko,\nin the 1970s, confirmed that indeed,the robin does find its way by somehow\nsensing the Earth's magnetic field,to give it directional information --\na built-in compass.The puzzle, the mystery was:\nHow does it do it?Well, the only theory in town --we don't know if it's the correct theory,\nbut the only theory in town --is that it does it via something\ncalled quantum entanglement.Inside the robin's retina --I kid you not -- inside the robin's retina\nis a protein called cryptochrome,which is light-sensitive.Within cryptochrome, a pair of electrons\nare quantum-entangled.Now, quantum entanglement\nis when two particles are far apart,and yet somehow remain\nin contact with each other.Even Einstein hated this idea;he called it \"spooky action\nat a distance.\"(Laughter)So if Einstein doesn't like it,\nthen we can all be uncomfortable with it.Two quantum-entangled electrons\nwithin a single moleculedance a delicate dancethat is very sensitive\nto the direction the bird fliesin the Earth's magnetic field.We don't know if it's\nthe correct explanation,but wow, wouldn't it be exciting\nif quantum mechanics helps birds navigate?Quantum biology is still in it infancy.It's still speculative.But I believe it's built on solid science.I also think that\nin the coming decade or so,we're going to start to see\nthat actually, it pervades life --that
