psychological\nissues in terms ofexperiments, and at least\ncorrelations in some cases orcausal studies through\nexperiments.And we discovered that\nif you thinkabout money, what happens?On average, you become more\nself-reliant or less willingto help, right?We discovered that if you just\nchange the way that men andwomen approach each other at a\ndating event, you change theirinternal feelings and their\nexternal behaviors simply bywho's approaching whom.So we learned all kinds of\nthings that you might or mightnot have known unless you\ndid the experiments.And for all these things that\nare our mental life-- ourthoughts, our feelings,\nthey are allsupported by our brains.And so for me personally as a\nneuroscientist, I've alwaysthought that the brain is one\nof the three amazing thingsout there in the\nnatural world.With the origins of the\nuniverse, the origin of life.And the brain that allow us to\nthink and feel, to see, thatremember, really everything that\nwe do comes from that.OK.So here's this device.And I want to share with you\njust this phrase that peoplesometimes use, which is\nthat your mind iswhat your brain does.That your mind is what your\nbrain does And so the readingsfrom Oliver Sacks for today kind\nof remind you of that.So there are two women who have", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.319}, {"text": "seizures of various kinds.And what happens in them?So one is Mrs. OC, 88-year-old\nwoman.And what starts to\nhappen to her?She starts to hear songs.And so powerfully, not just when\nyou have a little song inyour head, that it's hard for\nher to hear conversations.For her, a conversation like\nwe're having now, it's as ifthe music stayed\non really loud.Turns out she's having temporal\nlobe seizures.The temporal lobes are the parts\nof the brain that areterribly important\nfor hearing.So music is something\nthat we hear.And then she has a right\ntemporal lobe infarction.She's had an injury in the\nright temporal lobe.Music, for most of us, is more\ndependent on right hemisphereprocesses than the left.So that makes it unusual.And how does she feel about\nthe whole process?So what's generating\nthe songs, though?What's generating the songs\nthat she hears?Yeah, her memory.Her brain, right?Because in epilepsy,\nwhat's happening?Neurons are firing.When neurons fire in organized\npatterns, those are memories,desires, physical actions,\nthoughts.When they're firing for no good\nreason like an epilepsybecause of some brain\ndifficulty,they just start firing.But the neurons that happen to\nbe firing will drive certainmental processes that they\nnormally support.In this case, the neurons that\nare firing away are ones thatare involved in memory\nor songs andperception for songs.And when they fire, it's as if\nyou heard the song itself.Because when you hear my voice\nor when you hear a song,you're never hearing the song.You're always hearing what your\nneurons are interpretingthe sound that comes\nto your ear.Your mind is what your brain\ndoes in that sense, and in avery central way.If you had an injury in that\npart of the brain, you can becortically deaf and never hear\na sound, even though all theinformation came through\nyour ear.So without your brain\ninterpreting the environment,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.278}, {"text": "you wouldn't know what it is.But if your brain starts to fire\non its own, that's justas good a signal as if you\nheard a song itself.Because that is the stuff\nof hearing songs.So she enjoyed it, actually.She declined taking\nanti-convulsive medications.Because she felt it was a portal\nto her past, right?The songs that she heard were\nones that reminded her of herlife and were kind of\npleasant to hear.It was like being on a nonstop\nhighlight film of for life, ora highlight MP3.So now an opposite response to\na similar phenomenon comesfrom a Mrs. OM in her 80s.She hears songs, but she\nalso hears a lotof ringing and hissing.It's not limited to\nthe song itself.She doesn't mention any\nof this for how long?Four years.She's hearing ringing,\nhissing, songs.She knows because her mind is\nfine that they're coming fromnowhere but inside her head.But she doesn't tell anybody.That's a huge burden, right?And why doesn't she tell them?Yeah, yeah.And especially if you're in\nyour 80s, and you're goingaround saying, I'm hearing\nthings, people go, OK.Were putting you in the\nold age home, right?You're out of it.So she doesn't want to\ngive up her freedom.And she gets a short playlist,\njust three songs, and hearsthem over and over\nand over again.You may have had the experience\nthat some songs youhear for a while.You like them more, and then\nyou get tired of them.If you had only three all the\ntime, every day, and a badversion that was hissing and\nringing, you would get prettytired of the songs too.That stops by anti-convulsive\nmedications and medicationsthat stops the seizures,\nstop the songs.And so it's sort of a beautiful\nstory, when twoopposite emotional responses for\nhow your mind is what yourbrain does.Now from this, the fact that\nsongs are played back as ifyou had pulled out songs from\nyour computer or shelfsomewhere, you might think that\nthe brain retains theserecords perfectly throughout\nlife and epilepsy", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "would just sort them.But we'll come back to that\nlater on, and say that in verymuch, we don't think\nmemory is that way.But we do remember songs that\nare important for us.And if our brain just starts\nfiring in the same place wherewe store those songs, we hear\nthem just as real as yourcortex hears it when it hears\nthe actual song itself.Because that's the place\nwhere you hear it.So this is the kind of evidence\nthat at least in somesense, your mind is what\nyour brain does.And so here's this\namazing brain.It's about two to\nthree pounds.But every thought and feeling\nyou'll ever have, or everyphysical movement, every desire,\nevery thing thatyou're proud of or ashamed of\nthat crosses your mind will besupported by this structure.So I'm going to talk a little\nbit about the neurons, just alittle bit about the neurons\nthat compose the brain, and alittle bit about a quick tour\nthrough the gross organizationof the brain.We'll come back to many of these\nstructures as they'rerelevant to different things\nlike memory or emotion orpersonality later\nin the course.Talk a little bit about the\nenterprise of trying to saywhich parts of our brain\nsupport whichparts of our mind.Missteps about that, famous\ncases about that, that haveturned out to have roughly\nthe right message.And we'll focus on hemispheric\nspecialization, the thing inhumans where our left hemisphere\nand our righthemisphere are organized to\naccomplish different things,to support different\nmental functions.And the surprise from split\nbrain or commissurotomypatients, that these different\nmental lives that support ourdifferent parts of\nthe brain, thatthey can live in isolation.They don't even know they're\nthere one to the other.So let me rephrase this.As you sit there, the thought is\nyou might have independentparts of your mind supported\nby independentpart of your brain.And at any one moment, your\nconsciousness might be in onepart, and then it might\nmove to another.And just like there's all these\npeople in this room,your brain might be all these\nthings having their ownindependent thinking lives.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.182}, {"text": "They have to interact a lot.But how much might there be\nindependent modules in yourbrain that are doing\ntheir own thing.And now you're thinking about\nmusic, and those turn on, andthat's where your consciousness\nis.Now you're thinking\nabout history.Now you're thinking about\ndinner tonight.And different parts of your\nbrain turn on and that's whenyour consciousness is moving\nfrom one part of yourbrain to the other.But the other parts\nkeep going.So we'll see how plausible\nis that.So it took a long time for\npeople to decide that thebrain actually is the\nstuff of the mind.Smart philosophers like Plato\nsaid, well, it's part of thebody that's closest\nto the heavens.That's where the gods might\nreside, so that's a good placeto have your mind and that's\nwhere your brain is.A sort of GPS approach\nto locating wherethe mind might be.Aristotle said, wait a minute.It's the warm and active heart--\nthe heart was veryimpressive in post-mortem\nexamination of people who havepassed away--that houses the mind.And that it cools, and there's\nan inner brain.So the brain was kind of a\nradiator that would sort ofcool stuff off to keep\nthe heart in optimal.And even now, we talk\nabout people havinga big heart, right?A cold heart, a warm heart.We still talk about human\npersonality or character interms of heart.Galen said that the brain\nwas surrounded-- there'sventricles in the middle of\nthe brain that have fluid,cerebral spinal fluid.And he hypothesized that the\nbrain was the packing materialthat protects that fluid.Hang on to that fluid, that's\nall your stuff.We're going to cram a lot of\nstuff around it, right?Like the bubble pack that\ncomes in the boxes.And of course now we know it's\nthe opposite way around.The mind is in the physical,\nthe dense part ofthe brain, not that.And then ideas from Descartes,\nthe pineal body is one of thevery few structures that's in\nthe midline of the brain, thatdoesn't have a thing on the left\nand a thing on the right.And so he thought maybe that's\nwhere things get unified inthe whole brain.It all comes together\nas the place thatruns the whole brain.And that's a wrong idea.But people were trying to figure\nout what was going on.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.264}, {"text": "In modern neuroscience,\nthere's many levels ofanalysis of the brain.So if you go to any neuroscience\nprogram, likeDepartment of Brain and\nCognitive Science, you willactually see scientists who\nstudy things like moleculesand synapses, molecular\nneurobiology, how neuronswork, how neurons form networks,\nlittle organizationsof things that solve problems\nat a higher level, maps,systems in the brain\nas a whole.In this course, we mostly have\nto operate at this level.That's the place where it's easy\nfor us to relate in someways parts of the mind as we\nunderstand it, of human natureas we understand it, and\nphysical parts of the brain.It's very hard for\nus to get that tomolecules at the moment.But lots of neuroscience is\nworking to connect thesethings at different levels.And I can't resist talking for\none second, too, about thefact that we know our\nbrains were notdesigned from scratch.You are not humans 3.0\nor 98.0, right?Everything in us in some way\nevolved from other speciesthat were similar to us,\nand far enough back,dissimilar to us.So there's lots of speculation\nabout how it is that webalance parts of the brain\nthat are ancient in theirevolutionary roots, that are\nmore recent in theirevolutionary basis, and what\nthat means about us.Another sense in which we're\ncomprised of multiple societyof brain systems in\nbetween our ears.So we know the cells in the\nbrain are glia support cellsand neurons, that a neuron--and I know you all\nknow all this.Oh, let me say a word\nabout notes.So we sent PDFs of the lecture\nnotes from the first twolectures and the third\none just recently.Starting tomorrow, we'll send\nyou the PDF of each lecture,the latest by the night\nbefore the lecture.So you will be able to\nprint it out or lookat it on the computer.But neurons have a soma\nor cell body.Those make up the grey matter\nwhen we look at the brain.They have an axon that can be\ncovered with myelin that makesthe white matter.The dendrite is the extensions\nof the neurons that have theinput to the neuron.We know that neurons\ncommunicate byneurotransmitters across\nsynapses, junctions between", "start": 600.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "different parts of neurons.When you have a collection\nof cell bodies,people call it a nucleus.When you have a collection of\naxons, they call it a tract.It's just vocabulary\nand stuff.And you know this from other\ncourses, just reminding youabout them.And then you get these\nunbelievably startling kindsof numbers, which are always\nhuge estimates.But they show you how amazing\nyour brain is, and how hard itis for us to deeply understand\nhow the brain works.I mean, we understand incredibly\nmore than we did 10years ago, 20 years\nago, 30 years ago.We're incredibly far from\nunderstanding how your brainaccomplishes the amazing\nthings it accomplishes.So it has about 100\nbillion neurons.It has about 100 trillion\nsynapses, connections amongneurons and dendrites.If you were to lay out the very\nthin myelinated axons inyour brain, just the big axons\nthat get myelin, it'sestimated that you'd have\n62,000 miles of axons.That's pretty good, right?Now you really want to wear\nhelmets when you goskateboarding or anything,\nright?And about 100,000 miles of\ndendrites in each of you.So this is why the brain\nis amazing and hard.It's fantastic in\nits complexity.An average neuron may have up\nto 15,000 connections, 1,000synapses, and up to\n1,000 neurons.There's different ways\nof thinking about thecomputational power\nof a neuron.But they estimate that these\nmight have, each one thecomputational power of\nsomething like amedium-sized computer.So it's not the best computer,\nbut you've got100 billion of them.Now, that's the easy part.Take 100 billion neurons and\nyour computer's in your head.The hard part is to get them\nall working togetherefficiently.And you're not sitting around\ngoing, \"Computer 33, get up tospeed here.Something's wrong here.\" You\ndon't even

collaboratively.But we don't have a deep\nunderstanding of howthat all plays out.So here's a cartoon of this\namazing axon, the cell body,and the dendrites to\nget inputs to it.The axon is the output signal\nof a typical neuron.Neurons can have these beautiful\narborizations,tree-like properties\nof dendrites.Neurons have all kinds of\ndifferent shapes in differentparts of the brain, presumably\nreflecting their differentmissions, what they have\nto accomplish.An incredibly complicated\ncellular factory inside all ofthem is producing different\nthings.This is a big overview.This is not for you to learn\na specific fact.And this, here's an actual\nneuron that's injected in thefantastic tree of connections it\nmakes within the neurons toaccomplish its mission.Here's a cartoon

the brain as a whole.Here's the front of the\nbrain, top of thebrain, back of the brain.I'm going to say a word about\nthe cerebellum, which we'lltalk very little about\nin this course.The cellular organization\nof the cerebellum is soconsistent that people estimate\nthat half of all thecortical neurons in the brain\nare in the cerebellum.And if you see this cerebellar\nsize is small, not that large,it's because it's packed\nso tightly.And it's so consistent in its\norganization that peoplethought, that's the first part\nof the brain we'll crack.Because the organization is so\nclear that

these waves of\na gyrus going up and thenplunging into the depths, then\ncoming back up like this againand plunging from sulcus\nto sulcus?And nobody really knows.But there's kind of\na

you are sort of teenagers or\nyoung 20s or something likethat, most of you.So you don't remember your birth\nexperience directly.But who remembers your birth\nexperience pretty well?Your parents?OK.All right.It's your mother, especially.Giving birth is a\npretty painful,specific, challenging process.So if a head this big came\nout, it would beincommensurate with the\nbirth canal thatthe mother can afford.It's already pretty challenging\nwith your head asbig as it is when\nit comes out.That's the challenge of birth.It's not getting the\narms and legs out.Its the head that's

sulcus to sulcus,\nand this sort ofconvolved physical structure.And if we think about the brain,\nwe can think aboutthings that go into our brains,\nabout the outer world.So when you see, vision

understood the correct\nrelationship betweenform and function,\nwe'd be very far.And a neuroanatomist named\n[? Broadbent ?]made the following\nheroic effort.What he did is he sectioned\nbrains intolots of thin slices.And he followed them through\na microscope.And every time the brain tissue\nchanged, the

sudden\nthey start to lookdifferent, the neurons.And then that becomes something\nlike Area Three.Moving, moving, Area Four.Moving, moving, Area Six.So every time the neurons looked\ndifferent to his eye,it gets a new number.The idea being when the neurons\nlook different, theyhave a different job to do.And that part of the brain\ndoes something different.And there's lots of debates\nabout the best way to do this,or different interpretations.But something like this holds\ntrue in a striking way.The cellular organization of the\nbrain reflects in some waywhat that part of the brain is\naccomplishing, what part ofyour mind it supports.And then we have simplified\ncolor pictures of this.And we'll come back to\nneuroimaging next time.But it's turned out to have a\nsecond life in

good neuroanatomists.They describe lots of things\nabout the brain that werecorrect that were kind of\nunknown at the time.For example, the pyramidal\ntracts, the tracts that movefrom your motor

epilepsy,sometimes for tumors.And they want to know for you\npersonally with greatcertainty, which hemisphere is\nthe eloquent or speakinghemisphere?Because they want to remove more\ntissue if they're awayfrom your language areas, and\nless tissue if they're nearyour language areas.Maybe they won't even do a\ncertain surgery if they're toomuch in the middle of\nyour language areas.Because in many

nice one.Here's scissors projected\ninto left visual field.The right hemisphere,\nthat would pick thespoon and the fork.Because the crossing shape\nis resembling that.In the right visual field, left\nhemisphere, people wouldpick the needle and thread.Because that functionally\ngoes with scissors.So your mind is seeing the same\nthing, but in one caseit's tuned, in the left\nhemisphere, to

imagine that would\nbe a slow work day.These kinds of weird behaviors\npretty muchclear up within weeks.After that, you have to test\nto see the difference.Another one, they presented\nthe

why.Because their speaking\nhemisphere didn't see it.And they'll just say something\nlike, I was thirsty.So interestingly, they\nfill in motivations.They don't say, I don't know\nwhy, or I have a
