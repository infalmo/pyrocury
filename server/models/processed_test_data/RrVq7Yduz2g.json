And whenever we saysomething like that, we'll be\nable to write a differential,the partial of u, with respect\nto T at constant V, dT, plusthe partial of u with respect\nto V at constant T dV.So, if we write something\nlike this, it impliesthis kind of equation.And the main points of the\nlatter part of the lecture iswhat are these quantities?How do we measure them?How do we understand them?This one turns out to be the\nheat capacity, and this oneturns out to be something\nthat we measure inthe Joule-free expansion.So, that's the menu for today,\nat least that's what Moungi", "start": 120.0,

fixed volume, and\nwe have a little candle,and we're adding heat, and\nwhen we add heat, thepressure does what?STUDENT:PROFESSOR: It increases\nand the temperature.OK, we're you know,\nthis is MIT.You guys know something.You should yell it out,\nnot just whisper it.You have the confidence --I mean maybe up the street we\nwhisper, but here we know it.And, so here is a different kind\nof system where we have aconstant external pressure.We add heat to the system.And so here the volume\ncan change.The temperature can change.And so as we add heat here, the\ntemperature goes up andthe volume -- that was even\nquieter than last time.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.212}, {"text": "OK, but you know it.You understand it.Now, the coefficient that\nrelates the amount of heat into the temperature

path.And so this is one path,\nconstant volume.This has a particular value.Over here, we have dq=Cp dT, the\nheat, the proportionalitybetween heat and temperature\nrise is given by this, theconstant pressure\nheat capacity.They're different quantities.If we want to know the total\nheat added to the system, wecan measure it, which is the\nstraightforward thing, butsometimes you want to calculate\nin advance, orsometimes you want to calculate\nit on an exam.So, we do an integral over a\npath, for the heat capacityalong that path, dT.So, for Cp and Cv, these are\noften quantities that aremeasured as a function of\ntemperature, and one could, infact, calculate this integral.For most problems on exams,\nthose quantities are constant,independent of temperature.But there's no guarantee\nthat they will be.Now I get to tell a fun story.The relationship between heat\nand work was initiallyproposed in the 1940's\nby Joule.Now, there are two stories about\nJoule and how he came tothis insight.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.316}, {"text": "One is that he observed when\npeople were machining cannonbarrels, a lot of heat was\ngenerated, and there was a lotof work done.And so

just as untrue, isthat Joule, on his honeymoon,\ntook his wife to a mountainresort, and they were sitting at\nthe bottom of a waterfall,and he had this wonderful\nidea.And that was the water at the\nbottom of the waterfall isprobably going to be hotter than\nthe water at the top ofthe waterfall.So he grabbed his thermometer,\nand went and made a couple ofmeasurements and discovered\nthe first law ofthermodynamics.In fact, the water at the bottom\nof the waterfall ishotter than the water at the\ntop of the waterfall.And the idea was that gravity\ndid work on the water andfalling, and that work led to\nthe generation of heat.If you think about this, you\nprobably can come up withseveral other ideas for how the\nwater at the bottom mightbe warmer than at the top.I mean it's flowing fast at\nthe top, and it's sort ofpooled at the bottom, and there\nis sunlight and allsorts of things that could\nmake this coincidental asopposed to an insightful\nobservation.But it's a good

spun by a weight\nthat's droppingfrom here to here.So, this weight is being\nspun-- now I'm reallyfantastic at drawing this\nmechanical device, but you canimagine that dropping\na weight can cause apaddle wheel to turn.And we know about gravity,\nand we know about work.So, if you're doing physics,\nwork is the integral of force,dx, x1 to x2.Right, that's work.Now, gravity, well force,\nis equal to mass timesacceleration, and the\nacceleration dueto gravity is g.The force, as this weight drops\nis constant, and so thework is just going to be\nm g h, where this is h.So, it's a trivial matter,

ideal gas and it'sapproximately true\nfor other things.So, delta u is equal\nto zero for allisothermal ideal gas processes.And it's approximately\nequal to zero forall real gas processes.And so that means that delta\nu is always calculable fromCv(T) dT for any ideal\ngas change.So even if work is done,\nit doesn't matter.All you care about is what was\nthe temperature change?And this is always the easy way\nto calculate du, and it'soften the easy way to calculate\neither q or w, usingthe first law.So, since du is equal to q plus\nw, and for an isothermalprocess this is equal\nto zero, q = -w.For an ideal gas, for an\nisothermal process.It simplifies your\nlife enormously.You don't have to\ncalculate much.OK, so it's time to stop, I did,\nin fact, get caught up.I hope you didn't mind
