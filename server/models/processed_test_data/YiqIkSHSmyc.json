there is a\nStellar site established,and that will be the\nbasic thing that we use.This is a public site--math.mit.edu/learningfromdata.So a book is coming pretty\nquickly as we speak,or after we speak, and that\nsite has the table of contentsof the book, which would\ngive you an idea of whatcould be in the course.And I printed out a copy for\neverybody just of that onepage.This is probably the final--first and last handout--maybe-- with a\ntable of contents,which you'll see there.And also, you'll see there\nthe first two sectionsof the book, which is\nwhat I'll talk about todayand a little bit into Friday.So that's linear algebra, of\ncourse, because the coursebegins with linear algebra--actually, things that you\nwould know from 18.06,but this is a way to say this\nis really important stuff.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.134}, {"text": "So that's what I'll do today.I'd like to start on the\nlinear algebra today.Here's a great fact\nabout the course.So we taught it last\nyear, several of ustogether, and we knew there\nwouldn't be a final exam,but we imagined there might\nbe quizzes along the way.But then we couldn't think of\nanything to put on the quizzes.So we canceled those.But you do we learn\na lot, nevertheless.And so I guess we base the\ngrades on the homeworks.So the homeworks will be\npartly linear algebra questionsand partly online, like\nrecognizing handwriting,stitching images together,\nmany other things.And I'll talk about\nthose as we go.Good.So that's the general picture.And I'll say more\nabout it today.And I could answer\nany question about it.So we're getting videotaped.So if anybody's bashful,\nsit in the far back.But it'll be fun.You may know the\nvideos for 18.06.So this is the\nnext step, 18.065.It's pretty exciting for me.So any question, or\nshall I do a little math?Why not?And then I'll say a little\nmore about the course,just so you have an\nidea of what's ahead.And it looks like this room is\nexactly the right size to

vector.And then I'll graduate\nto multiplying a matrixby a matrix.And you will say,\nI know that stuff.But do you know\nit the right way?Do you think of the\nmultiplication the right way?So let me tell you what I\nbelieve to be the right way.So let me take a matrix, say,\n2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 7, and 3, 4, 12.And I'll always call matrices A.So first step is just A\ntimes x, A times a vector.So I multiply A by,\nlet's say, x1, x2, x3.And how do I look\nat that answer?So the choices-- think\nof the rows of the matrixor think of the columns.And if you think\nof the rows, whichis the standard way to multiply,\nyou would take the dot product.So the first way is dot\nproducts of row dotted with x.2x1 plus x2 plus 3x3.It gives you the answer\na component at a time.That's the low level way.The good way to see\nit is vector-wise.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "See this as x1 multiplies\nthat first column, x2 timesthe second column,\n1, 1, 7, and x3 timesthe third column, 3, 4,

that's the right answer.And of course, the\nfirst componentis 2x1 and 1x2 and 3x3.The same 2, 1, 3-- the same dot\nproduct, it comes out right.But you see it all at\nonce instead of piecemeal.Part of the course--I guess part of what\nI hope to get acrossis thinking of a matrix\nas a whole thing,not just a bunch of nine\nor m times n numbers.But thinking of it as a thing.A matrix multiplies a vector\nto give another vector.So when I say Ax, you\nimmediately think that--you immediately think, OK,\nAx has a clear meaning,it's a combination\nof the columns of A.So now let me take\nthat next step.And the next step is think\nabout all combinationsof the columns of A.\nWe take the matrix A,and we take all x's and we\nimagine all the outputs.And what I want to ask you\nis, what does that look like?", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "If I just take 1 vector\nx, I get a vector output.It takes a vector to a vector.But now I take all x's--all of vectors x in 3D and\nI get all these answers,and I think of\nthem all together.So I've got a bunch of vectors--infinitely many\nvectors, actually.And the question is, if I plot\nthose infinitely many vectors,what do I have?And the beauty of linear algebra\nis that questions like this--you can answer them and\nyou intuitively see it.You certainly see it in 3D\nand you have the right ideain 10 dimensions, even.Most of us don't see\ntoo well in 10d--in R10.But here we got three.So do you see what I'm saying?I'm taking all x's.So all Ax gives us a\nbig bunch of vectors.And that collection\nof vectors iscalled the column space of A.\nIt's a space, in other words.That's the key word there,\nthe column space of A.And I'll just write it as C of\nA when I need letters for it.So I'm going to ask you,\nwhat does this column spacelook like?And that depends on the matrix.Sometimes that column space\nwould be the whole of R3.Sometimes it's a smaller\nset in R3, a space.Do you know what\nit is in this case?Do I get all of

this matrix--what's up with that matrix?No, it's not.So what do I get\ninstead of all of R3?I get a plane, yeah.If you get that insight.So by taking x's--everybody's with\nme-- all x's here.So that means that\nit fills in whatever.And, well, because\nit's linear algebra,it's going to be likely all of\nR3 or a plane, or even a line.Let me just bat over\nhere for a moment.Give me a matrix whose column\nspace would only be a line.All 1s?OK.Wow, that's a-- let me\nliven it up a little.3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8.So I think that the\ncombinations of those columnsare all on the same line.That says that the column\nspace is just a line.And I would say then\nthat the matrix--so column space of\nthis A is a line.Another way I could say this\nis that the rank of the matrixis 1.The rank is sort of the\ndimension of the column space.Well, not sort,\nthat's what it is.The rank is the\ndimension of the column--everybody sees that\nyou get a line?Because any combination\nx1 of that plus x2of that

special--that's making the column\nspace special, a plane insteadof the whole thing?Yeah, what's up with\nthese three columns?AUDIENCE: The third\ncolumn is the sum of it.GILBERT STRANG: The third\ncolumn is the sum of these two.So the first column\nis fine, 2, 3, 5.Second column is in a\ndifferent direction.And when I take combinations\nof the first two columns,what will I get?Sorry to keep asking you\nquestions, but that's--anyway, that's what I always do.So the combinations of those\nfirst two columns are--?AUDIENCE: A plane.GILBERT STRANG: A\nplane because they'rein different-- everybody\nsees that picture.We've got column one going\nthat way and column twogoing that way.And then if I take any\nmultiple of column one,I've got a whole line, any\nmultiple of column two.And then when I put\nthe two together,it fills in the plane.Yeah.Your intuition\nsays that's right.So this is a matrix of rank.What's the rank of this matrix?AUDIENCE: Two.GILBERT STRANG: Two.Because it's got two\nindependent columns,but the third\ncolumn is dependent.The third column is a\ncombination of the others.So matrices like this are\nreally the building blocksof linear algebra, they're\nthe building blocksof data science.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "They're rank one matrices.And let me show you a special\nway to write those rank onematrices.I think of this matrix as\nthe column vector 1, 1,1 times the row vector 1, 3, 8.So it's a column times a row.That's a rank one matrix.Do you see-- that's a\ntrue multiplication there.It looks a little weird, but\nit's a 3 by 1 matrix times a 1by 3 matrix.These numbers have\nto be the same,and then the output is 3 by 3.And it's that.And do you see that it factors?So I'm going to move\non to that idea.The next idea coming up\nwill be that we can see--well, that's coming, that\nwe're going to see matriceswith two factors.Let me move to that, but back\nfor this original matrix.So what's with this?The column space is a plane.Think about now the key\nidea of independent columns.How many independent\ncolumns have I got here?AUDIENCE: Two.GILBERT STRANG: Two, correct.Two.The third column, if I want to\nespecially pick on that one--I'll often go left to right.So I'll say the first guy\nis good, second guy is good,the third guy is not\nindependent of the others.So I just have two\nindependent columns.And those two

for it.So you have the\nidea of A times x.You have the idea of\ncolumn space of A,which allows all x's.Then now, we're moving into the\nidea of independent columns,and the number of independent\ncolumns is the rank.So the rank-- shall I\nwrite that somewhere?Maybe here.The rank is the number\nof independent columns.And right now, what do I\nmean by independent columns?Well, let's just see what\nthat means by using it.Are we good?I know I'm reviewing here.But allow me for this first\nclass and part of next timealso to review.But you'll see something new.In fact, why don't we see\nsomething new right away.Let me follow up on the\nidea of independencein a systematic way.So here's my matrix A.\nCan I write that again?2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 7, and this\nguy was the sum of those.So

basis is independent columns.So all three together\nwould not be a basis.But they have to be\nnot just independent,but they have to fill the\nspace-- their combinations haveto fill the space.So 2, 3, 5--let's say I want\nto create a basis.I'll call the matrix C, a\nbasis for the column space.So here's a natural\nway to do it.I look at the first column.It's not 0s.If it was all 0s, I wouldn't\nwant that in a basis.But it's not.So I put it in.So that's the first\nvector in my basis.Then I go on to\nthe second column.If that column was 4,\n6, 10, what would I do?If that second\ncolumn was 4, 6, 10,would I put it in the basis?No.But 1, 1, 7, is OK, right?1, 1, 7 is in a\ndifferent direction.It's not a combination of\nwhat we've already got.So I say, OK, that\nadds something new.Put it in.Then I move on to\nthe third column.Do I put that into a basis?You know the answer by now.No.Because I'm looking to see, is\nit a combination of these guys?And it is.It's one of that\nplus one of that.So it's not independent.So I've finished now.I've got a matrix C, which\nwas taken directly from A,and I kept only\nindependent columnsand I worked from left to right.And I can see that right away\nnow

dependent.And I don't exactly see--there's some combination\nof that row and that rowthat gives that one.And of course, when I\nlooked at the first column,I thought, OK, it's\ngoing to be too easy.One

I have to tell you,\nI was really pleased.So the first two pages\ngot two more pagesto follow up on that\nidea, that here, wewere seeing something that--I proved in 18.06, but not\nin the first
