[{"text": "CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome\nback to recitation.In this video, what\nI'd like you to dois use least squares to\nfit a line to the followingdata, which includes three\npoints: the point (0, 1),the point (2, 1),\nand the point (3, 4).And I've drawn a rough\npicture where these points areon a graph, and I'll be\ntalking a little bit about thatafter you try this problem.So why don't you try to\nsolve the problem basedon the technique you\nlearned in class,and then bring\nthe video back up.I'll show you again what\nyou're actually doing,and then I will also solve\nthe problem and you can see,you can compare\nyour answer to mine.OK, welcome back.So the first thing I want to do\nwhen we're talking about leastsquares to fit a line to these\ndata, what I'd like to dois I'm going to\ndraw a line on here,and we're going to talk about\nwhat the least squares actuallyis trying to do.And so I'm going to draw this\nline, say, something like this.That's my first\nguess on what mightbe the actual least squares\nline for these data.And if you recall, what\nyou're actually trying to dois you're trying to\nminimize a certain quantity,and the quantity you're\ntrying to minimizeis the difference between\nthe actual value you getand the expected value you\nget, the square of that.So this is one thing\nwe're going to square.So even pictorially,\nwe could saywe have something that\ncontributes some area, OK,and then this is\nanother thing that'sthe difference between\nthe expected value in yand the actual value you get.So let me try and\nmake that squared,because we square that value.And then this last\none is pretty small.The difference between\nthe expected valueand the actual value is\nvery small over in this case", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "from the picture I drew.And so what you're\ntrying to do isyou're trying to\nfind the line thatminimizes the area of\nthe sum of these three,in this case, three squares.So if I, you know, if I tip\nthe line down further here,but I kept it fixed there,\nthe area of this squarewould get bigger, because this\ndistance would get bigger.But, of course, the area of\nthis square would get smaller.And so you're\ntrying to figure outa way to optimize, in\nthis case, minimize,the area of these--\nsorry, the sumof the areas of these\nsquares by figuring outwhere to put the line.Now, I mentioned if I could\nfix this here and move itup and down, then that\nwould change the slopebut fix the intercept.But I could also move the\nintercept up and down,and I could slide\nthe line up and down,and that would fix the slope\nbut vary the intercept,or I could do both.And ultimately, that's\nwhat you're doing.You're trying to find the best\ny-intercept and the best slopeat the same time, and that's\nwhy you learned this processin multivariable\ncalculus, because you'retrying to optimize\nsomething that has twoquantities that you can change.You can change slope and you\ncan change the y-intercept,so that's why you\nlearned it now insteadof in single-variable calculus.Now, if we come over\nhere, I wrote down aheadof time what the equations\nare you get when you optimize,when you're trying to optimize\nthe least squares line.So if you write down,\nyou know, the functionas a function of\na and b, and youtake the derivative\nwith respect to aand you set it equal to zero,\nyou get the first equation.When you take the\nderivative with respectto b and you set\nit equal to zero,you get the second equation.And so I'm just going\nto fill in the detailsand then tell you\nwhat the solution is,and then I'm going to mention a\nlittle more sophisticated thingwe can do, or I guess\nmaybe the next levelof least squares we can do,\nthat's not a linear problem.So I'll do that last.So what I want to do is I put\nall the values I need over here", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "on the right.So all the values we\nneed are on the right.We're going to need the sum\nof all the x_i's and that's 5.The sum of all the y_i's is 6.The sum of the x_i\nsquareds is 13,and the sum of the\nx_i*y_i product is 14.Now, where are\nthese coming from?Remember, what is\nx_i and what is y_i?If we come back over here,\nthis is (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2),(x_3, y_3), OK?So that's sort of how we get--\nif we switch the whole pairsaround, it doesn't matter.Obviously, if we switched\nx- and y-values together,it does matter, and that you\nsee actually from the equationdoes matter.Right here you have\na product of them.So let me write this out.And again, we're solving for\na and b, so in this case,a is the slope and b is\nthe intercept, right?So let me write everything in.So we actually get that we want\nto solve the following system:13a plus 5b is equal to 14.Make sure I put in\neverything correctly.And then the second one is\n5a plus-- n in this caseis 3, because there were three\npoints-- plus 3b is equal to 6.OK, this is a\nsystem of equations.It has two equations\nand two unknowns,and if you solve this-- I\nshould look at my notes,because I didn't\nmemorize it and I'm notgoing to do all the algebra.If you go to solve this,\nwhat you actually getis that a is equal to 6/7\nand b is equal to 4/7.So you get that the line--\nlet me write it here.You get a is equal to 6/7\nand b is equal to 4/7, OK?And so what that tells you is\nif you come back over here,the line we actually want-- I'll\nwrite the solution right here--the line we actually want is the\nline y equals 6/7 x plus 4/7.That is our least squares\nline that is our solution.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "OK?So that is actually-- solving\nfor a line to fit these data,you get the following solution.But I want to point out,\nand what we're going to do,after this video there will be\na challenge problem, to haveyou actually finish this.I want to point out\nthat you can actuallyalso fit a higher-degree\npolynomial to these data.For instance, you\ncould try and usethe technique of least\nsquares to fit a parabolato these data.And let me point out\nwhat the function wouldlook like in this case.So this is for the\nchallenge problem.For the challenge\nproblem, it nowwill be a function\nof three variables,so it will look\nsomething like this.We'll say a comma b comma\nc, and the point that we'llbe wanting to minimize,\nor the functionwe'll be wanting to minimize,\nwe're summing over i, againfrom 1 to 3-- I didn't\nwrite that down above,but it was fairly\nobvious that thatwas what we were summing\nover-- the following thing.We have y_i minus\nthis big quantity:a x_i squared plus b*x_i plus c\nand we square the whole thing.And so what this\nis actually givingyou is, just as in\nthe picture before,this is giving\nyou the differencebetween the expected value\nand the actual value.So this is your actual y-value,\nand based on the parabolayou're looking for,\nwhat's in parentheses isyour expected y-value, right?So this would actually\nbe my parabola.When I evaluate it at\nx_i, I get a number.I get a value, and that value\nwill be on the parabola.This will be the\ny-value associatedto the x-value from the data.So this is the actual value.This is the expected value.We take the difference\nand square it.And because we want\nto minimize howwe're going to\nsolve this problemand this is what\nyou'll have to dois, just like with\nthe line situation,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "you're going to take the\nderivative of this functionwith respect to each of these\nthree variables separately.So you'll take f sub a, and then\nyou'll set that equal to zero.And then you'll take f sub b,\nyou'll set that equal to zero.And then you'll take\nf sub c, and you'llset that equal to zero.Again, we set them\nall equal to zero,because this is really\nan optimization problem.We want to minimize something.We want to minimize\nthis quantity.So you take each of\nthose three derivatives,partial derivatives,\nset them equal to zero,and you have a system of three\nequations with three variables.And you know how to solve such\na system, by using matrices,for instance.That would be one way\nto solve such a system.And so then you can\nactually come upwith a formula for the sort\nof parabola of best fit,you could think of it as.And so I'm going to stop there,\nbecause I think from here,you guys will do it.But I just want\nto point out thisis where you're\ngoing to be startingthis next sort of\nchallenge problemto find the quadratic of\nbest fit for these three datapoints.So that's where I'll end it.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}]
