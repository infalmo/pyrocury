a\nguest speaker, Joel Freed,coming to talk to us\nabout PokerTracker.As you know, we have\na great partnershipgoing with PokerTracker\nin this class.They sent along Joel Freed\nto teach us analytics.Joel is a VIP support director\nfor Max Value Software, who'sthe parent company\nof PokerTracker.He has taught\nanalytical techniquesto some of the biggest\nnames in the poker industry.And he's come by to teach\nus that sort of thing, also.So with that, I'm going\nto pass it along to Joel.JOEL FREED: Thanks.I hope you all have had a chance\nto install PokerTracker by now.PokerTracker is the\nindustry leading analysisand tracking software\nfor online poker players.We've been around since 2001.So we've been able to grow as\nthe poker economy has grown.It started out as\nsoftware only for peoplewho played limit hold 'em.And it has exploded.We do Omaha now-- obviously,\nno-limit and pot limithold 'em.And we have extensive tournament\nsupport, some of whichwe'll be talking about today.What PokerTracker does is it can\nhelp you identify and analyzesimilar decision points to\nhelp you improve your game.So PokerTracker's not\ngoing to do it all for you,but it's going to help you find\nthe spots where you can improveand make better decisions.So what do I mean when\nI say, decision point?A decision point is\nany time in a handwhere you can make some action.So you can check.You can bet.You can call.You can raise.Or, you can fold.At any point in the hand\nwhere you can do that,I'm going to call\nthat a decision point.And when you play poker, after\nyou've played for a while,or if you've already\nplayed for a while,you'll realize you naturally\nremember similar decisionpoints.If you're the short\nstack in a tournament,and it's folded to you\nand the small blind,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.555}, {"text": "you're going to be able to lump\nall of those kinds of decisionstogether so that, when you face\nthat decision the next timearound, you already have some\nkind of history to build on.And using PokerTracker\nto analyzethe interesting decision points\nis really a very effective wayto improve your game\nbecause, the next time youcome to a similar\ndecision, you will alreadyhave some memory of\nwhat you believedto be right last time you were\ndoing something like this.So what makes a decision\npoint interesting?It's interesting when you aren't\nsure what the right answer is.And that may seem\nkind of obvious.But when the expectation\nof the outcomesis really close together, you're\ngoing to sit at the table,and you're going\nto agonize over it.And that's where you see\npeople on television, wherethey're sitting there for\nminutes, and they're going,ah, I don't know what to do.And those are the\ninteresting decision points.And as you start out, you will\nfind that you really don'tknow what you're doing a lot.All decision points are\ngoing to be interestinguntil you start to have\nsome kind of heuristic,some kind of rubric for\nwhen to call, when to fold.So here is a situation.We are in the big blind.It's 100/200 blinds.This is a tournament.In this tournament, it was\na single table tournament.Let's say you bought in for $10.$50 goes to first place,\n$30 goes to second place,and $20 goes to third place.So there's four\nplayers left here.You have a chip\nstack of 1,430 chips.And the cutoff\nhere, this player,opened all in for 5,700 chips.The player on the button folded.And this player called\nfor 2,980 chips.So these two guys\nare already all in.You have ace, queen of clubs.So you're ace, queen suited.And you have 1,430\nchips back in this spot.I want you to take a second.And I want you to think\nabout this decisionand, whether in this spot,\nknowing nothing about these two", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.199}, {"text": "players, you don't really know\ntoo much about them right now,we'll get into that\na little bit later.But without knowing anything\nreally about these guys,they're just your average\nplayers in the game,would you be calling or folding?I want you to think\nabout that for a second.So I'll point out\nanother feature here.For those of you who are\nfamiliar with pot odds.Your odds here are\n3.35 to 1 to call.If this was a cash\ngame and if youhad 23% equity against\nboth of those hands,you could call profitably.Obviously, this is a tournament\nsituation which affects thingsdrastically right here.So the total pot size is 4,810.We have 1,430 to call.So if you believe that this\nis a very easy decision,raise your hand.One, two-- we've got a few.Awesome.You guys are right.If you think it's a call, I\nwant you to raise your hand.One call.For the people think it's\nclose, if you think it's a call,raise your hand.One, two.Got a few.It's not even close.And it's fold.Let me talk a little bit about\nwhat's going on in this view.This is from our ICM quiz.PokerTracker has a\nfeature that letsyou practice in these end of\ntournament situations, whichyou can access through the Tools\nmenu bar-- Tools, ICM, Quiz.And in this spot, what it's\ntelling you is, if you push,based on an average player\nmodel for these two players,your equity in the\ntournament is 9.49%based on the expectation of this\nhand against these two playerswhen they're all in,\nfor average opponents.That means that you could expect\nto make $9.49 with the prizewe've picked out.If you fold, however, you\nhave an expectation of 18.67%", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.241}, {"text": "And the reason for\nthis is that it'sreasonably likely that the\nplayer with 2,980 chipsis going to go out.And once you do that, you\nare guaranteed third place.So this is a clear fold.It's even, in fact, a clear\nfold if you have kings.And you can go further in\nthe poker tracker ICM tool.If you click the Results\nlink that's right here,it will bring up the\nfull math, and I'm notgoing to go through the\nICM math right now for you.I know you're going\nto go through thatlater in the course.But what you can do is you\ncan change their ranges, righthere, by clicking these buttons.And so I've set\nthem to 100% range.That means these players\nare playing any two cards.So even if you knew before the\nhand, they pushed all in blind,they didn't even\nlook at their hands,they could have any two\ncards, either one of them,it's still a fold because fold\nequity still is close to 19%,and your push equity is\n15%, even though you'regoing to win half of all hands\nagainst two random cards.So before we talk\na little bit moreabout how to use PokerTracker\nto analyze your gameand see where you\ncan improve, I wantedto talk a little\nbit about how youcan use PokerTracker and not\nget better poker because there'ssome great and interesting\nstuff in PokerTrackerthat you can spend\nlots of time lookingat that will not help you at\nall make a better decision.So looking at graphs.People love looking at\ntheir results graphs.And here's a nice results graph.You started off at hand one.You had a nice run here.You went steady\nfor a little while.You won a few big hands\naround hand 183,000.And then you end up\nabout plus 860,000 Euros.Since poker is a series\nof decision points,the question is, which decisions\nwould you make differentlybased on this graph.And the answer is\nabsolutely none of them.Knowing that you did\nthis well in this spotis not going to help you make\nbetter decisions in the future.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.251}, {"text": "It may allow you to buy a\nhouse in the Boston area,but it will not help you\nactually play better poker.Another way you will\nnot get better at pokerby using PokerTracker is by\nlooking at hands, which we callwalks.A walk is when you're in the\nbig blind and everyone foldsto you.You win the small\nblind, which is nice.But you didn't do anything.There's no way in which\nyou could make a betterplay in that hand.And I know a lot\nof heads up, sitand go players who play\ntwo player tournaments liketo look at those kinds of\nspots and they want to know,how much am I winning there.And the answer is\nit doesn't matterbecause you can't change your\nplay based on who folds to you.Another thing that people\nwant to do with PokerTrackerthat won't help them get better\nat poker is analyzing luck.We have several tools\nfor luck in PokerTracker.This graph is from\nthe cash game side.It is actually-- you'll\nnotice the normal curve.This is actually normalized.So what you're seeing\nhere is each dottells you how often you're\nhitting your draws relativeto expectations.So this player is more\nthan one standard deviationabove the mean at flopping\nthree of a kind whenhe holds a pocket pair,\nwhich we call flopping a set.And that's fantastic.He's probably\nmaking lots of moneywhen he has these pocket\npairs because making a setis a very powerful hand.However, he's not going\nto be able to changethe way he plays by knowing\nthat he's been lucky in the pastbecause he may or\nmay not continueto be lucky in the future.I also have a friend who\nspent lots of time buildinglots of reports to see if he\nwas getting dealt aces moreregularly than average.And while it's great\nto be dealt acesmore regularly than average--\nand you will make lotsmore money if you get dealt aces\nmore regularly than average--knowing what happened last week\nwill not help you the next timeyou're sitting at\nthe poker table.The last thing I'm going to say\nabout PokerTracker-- and thisis a little bit trickier--\nthere are lots of statistics,and lots of numbers\nin PokerTracker.I think that we have easily\nover 1,000 different statisticsyou can look at, especially\nwhen you consider combinations", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.562}, {"text": "of position.And if you add stack size,\nit's in the thousands for sure.And the problem is, some are\nnot relevant to the spot you'relooking at.And some will lack\na sufficient sample.So I'm going to use\nthis hand to illustrateboth of those points.This is a cash game hand\nfrom a from real poker sitefrom about four years ago.The player, hero,\nhere was on the buttonand was dealt ace of\nspades, 10 of hearts.So he had ace, 10 off suit.Before the flop,\nvillain16 made a raise.And hero called.The flop was two of\nspades , four of spades,three of diamonds.villain16 made a bet.And hero made a call.I'm not going to go into whether\nor not that was a good play.There are reasons for it.There are reasons against it.But for the purposes\nof this hand,it's important to note\nthat that happened.On the turn, villain16 also\nbet, and hero also called.The turn was the 10 of\ndiamonds and the riverwas the ace of hearts.So now, we have two pair--\ntop two pair in fact.And villain16 makes another bet.The bet was 1,550\nBritish pounds.And the pot was 1,975 pounds.So we're sitting here.We're getting 2.27 to 1 odds.So if we call and we're ahead\n31% of the time or more,it's a good call.We can fold.Our stack is 3,350, so we\ncould also make a raiseto like 1,700, 1,800.Now we have lots of\nstats here on the table.I'm not going to go\nthrough them all.This is our heads up display.So we're looking, right now,\nat the PokerTracker replayer.The important ones to\nnote for this purposeis this red number\nhere-- this 97--this is the number of hands of\ndata we have on this player.So if you were\nsitting at a casino,you get about 30\nhands an hour, so thiswould be the equivalent\nof about three hoursof live play against somebody.Online, it's more like\nan hour and a halfbecause online hands tend\nto come a bit faster.So we've got some data.It's not a huge sample.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "VP is the VPIP number that\nwas talked about last time.That's the percentage\nof hands he's playing.So he's been playing\nabout 2 out of 3 hands.So he's been in a lot of pots.So we know that about this guy.And PR is Preflop Raise.That's how often he's\ncoming in for a raise,or raising at some\npoint in the hand.And that's 45%.So 2/3 of the time--\nbecause 45 over 65is 2/3, roughly--\nhe's making raises.So he's aggressive and\nhe's playing lots of hands.And here we're in this spot.We're facing a big\nbet on the river.So we've got his river stats.So if you click\non the HUD, you'regoing to get this pop-up.There's a bunch of tabs here,\nTools, Preflop, Flop, Turn,River.Since this is a river spot, I've\njust got the River tab open.I didn't want to\noverwhelm you guys yet.And we can see his bet stats.So on the river, in\nour entire sample,he's had eight chances\nto bet the river.And he bet three\nof those chances.And I'm going to tell you\nthat that number is completelyand totally irrelevant\nto this situationbecause we can also see\nthis number for cbet.Now cbet is a poker term.Is called a continuation bet.That means that a player has\nbeen aggressive the entire handup till now.So a cbet on the flop, he\nwas the last raiser preflop.He gets a chance to open the\naction on the flop and he does.That's a flop continuation.A turn continuation bet--\nhe made a flop cbet,and he now has a chance\nto bet on the turn,he makes a turn bet.So that's a turn cbet.A river cbet is he\nmakes a turn cbet.And now he has a chance\nto bet the river.And we have never, not\nonce, seen him get a chanceto make a river cbet.So if we tried to use this\n38% here, and we said,well, he only bets\n38% of the river,so he must have a\nreally big hand here,we would be basing it\non wrong informationbecause he could have gotten\nto the river in any wayfor these bets to count.He could have been\ncalling-- a calling downin position, and then\nit was checked to him,and that that would count.He could've been raising.He could've raised\npreflop, checked the flop,", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.976}, {"text": "checked the turn.That would count.Any combination.And his hand strength\nis going to bevastly different\nthose times he isbet the entire way\nthan those timeswhere he's done other things.So since we have a sample\nof zero cbets here,these river stats\nare not actuallythat useful for\nanalyzing this spot.You're much better off\nlooking at the boardand trying to figure\nout, based on his preflopnumbers and his flop numbers,\nwhat kind of hand gets here.I could talk about\nthis hand a lot more,but that's our PowerPoint here.Now we've talked about ways\nthat you can not get betterat poker using PokerTracker.Let's get to the\ninteresting stuff.How do you get better at\npoker using PokerTracker 4?And I'm going to say\nit's a five step process.Step one, use\nPokerTracker for reportsand filters to look at very\nspecific kinds of decisionpoints.Find those times you\nfind interesting.Find those times where\nyou don't know the answer,and those are the\nones we're goingto look-- you should be\nlooking at because thoseare ones that are going to\nhelp you get better at poker.The next thing to do is create\nmental models of the playersin a specific situation.So that means you should have\nan idea of what you thinkthose players are doing here.Now even though they're looking\nat similar kinds of decisionpoints, you're not always\ngoing to have similar kindsof players in those hands.If you want to look at all\ntimes you were facing a rivercontinuation bet, you're\ngoing to have sometimes you'reagainst aggressive players\nand sometimes you'reagainst passive players.You're going to have times where\nthe river made a draw come in.You're going to have times where\nthe river paired the board.All these are\nslightly different.And not necessarily\ndifferent enough--you wouldn't want to lump\nthem together for point 1,but enough that you\nneed to definitely thinkabout the players in\nthis specific situationand try to get an idea what's\nthis player doing right here.This is exactly what you\nwould do at a live tablewhen you're sitting\nacross the tablefrom somebody trying to\nfigure out what is goingthrough his mind right now.Then you adjust that\nmodel that you've justbuilt based on any relevant\nstatistics that you", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.561}, {"text": "do happen to have-- if you have\nnotes on the player or anythingelse.If you know that this guy\nlost a big hand two hands ago,and he might be, what's called\nin the poker world, steaming.He is really mad.And he is just going to be\nway more aggressive right now,that's relevant information.If you're sitting\nin a casino and youknow that guy has just\nfinished his fifth bearand he's slurring his\nwords a little bit,that's relevant information.Anything that you can do to\nadjust the model that you'vebuilt to be more\nrelevant, that's good.Then you evaluate your\ndifferent decision options.So if you're in a\nspot where, let's say,you can just either\ncall or fold.You have to think about what\nkind of hand does he have.Will I win if I\nmake a call here?If I fold, obviously,\nI'm out of the hand.For tournaments, what chip\nstack will I have remaining?How does this affect\neveryone else's standingsin the tournament?There's a lot of considerations\nfor tournaments that affect,especially, your\npreflop decisions.And then, once you've done\nall four of these things,go to step one and do it again.Continue to do this\nover and over again,every time you have an\ninteresting kind of decision,and you will find that you are\nable to make better decisionsbecause you understand the\ndifferent decision pointsthat you're facing.So let's talk about\nhow to navigatePokerTracker 4 a little bit.For those of you who\nhave it installedand have your\ncomputer here, feelfree to open up PokerTracker\nand follow along with me.So what I'm calling a\nreport is any kind of wayin which PokerTracker\nis showing you data.On the top left\nhere, this community,which launches our\ncommunity page,you can look at our forums.You can download custom stats,\nall sorts of other fun stuff.Play Poker.This is where you go when\nyou want to actually play.So for those of you\nwho haven't actuallydone any importing in\nany of the tournamentsyet, when you want to\nplay, you go to Play Pokerand you click the Gets\nHands While Playing button.And View Stats here,.This is where all\nof your informationis going to be displayed.T is for tournament,\nwhich is going to be", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.412}, {"text": "all you guys are interested in.And we have four options,\nResult, Statistics, My Reports,and Graphs.And I'm not going to\ntalk about Graphs todayat all just because there\nreally isn't enough time.So there's this left\nhand side bar here.And some people\nhave liked closingit to make things bigger.And you should not\nforget that it is there.A lot of the navigation\noptions are in that sidebar.And there is a huge\namount of valuein being able to change reports.So right now, we're looking\nat the overview report.It's got a nice graph.You can change different\nkinds of graphs.You can show your ROI, your ITM.ROI is Return On Investment.ITM is In The Money percentage.You can show those\non this graph, too.You can see your\nresults-- how muchyou've won, how many\ntournaments you've played.And down here-- so\nthis is a report.Right now, we're looking\nat the basic By Descriptionreport, which is showing\nyou one row per descriptionof tournament type.For you guys, honestly, just\nlooking at By Tournamentis probably going to be OK.That will give you one row\nper individual tournament.You're not going to\nhave so much datathat it's going to be hard\nto group things together.And most of your tournaments\nare relatively similar.If you choose Advanced rather\nthan Basic, all it doesis give you more stats.So you might want to\nspend some time lookingat what these numbers\nmean in Basic before youflip to Advanced.And it's also important to\nknow-- so you can changeany report from this drop down.And I'll talk about what\nthe different ones arein a little bit.But the Overview Report\nhas one really cool featurethat is not obvious, and\nthat is you can doubleclick to get more detail.So if you want to know more\nabout these 392 tournamentsbecause those are\nthe ones you'regoing to start playing\ntomorrow and thoseare the ones that are\nreally interesting,then you double click.And now you see each one\nof those 392 tournaments,one tournament per row.And you get to see\nhow much you wonin that tournament, how\nlong it was, your finishposition, all kinds of stuff.And it does say\nhere on the side,double click a row\nfor more details.And you can go back by\nchoosing Back By Descriptionor choosing Remove All\nfilters and Return to Route.", "start": 1080.0, "heat":

see\nexactly what's happening.Another really awesome report\nis the Hold 'em Hand RangeVisualizer.This is in Statistics as well.And it looks like a lot, but\nit's not actually as crazyas it looks.So first off, over here, we have\nvarious different statistics.So when you choose\na statistic, you'regetting information based\non your values in this spot.So let me talk about\nwhat three betting is.Three betting means someone\nhas made a first raise.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.194}, {"text": "That's the two bet.And then you made\nthe second raise.And we're talking about\npreflop only right

all\nkinds of different spots.And this little wrench\nhere lets you configure.If you want to put\ndifferent stats here,you can do that, too.Right now, we're\nlooking at range.So here it says,\nRange and Value.So when I say range, I mean\nthese are the hands that youhave actually done this with.These numbers here\nare percentages.And each one tells\nyou what percentageof all of the hands that I\nhave made a three-bet withdoes this comprise.Let's look at pocket 10s.This player made a\nreraise with pocket 10s--of hands he made a\nreraise, 2.244% of those,he had pocket 10s.So you can think about this\nas, if I made this raise,and someone else was against me,\nwhat could they expect to see.About almost 4% of\nthe time, they'dexpect to see ace,\nqueen offsuit.4.28% of the time, they'd\nexpect to see ace, king.2 and 1/2% of the time, aces.So this is what your\nactual range looks like.And in poker, we use\nrange as the termfor-- if you think of the\ndomain as all hole cards--so those are all hole cards\nyou could be playing--your heuristics, your mental\nprocesses at playing pokeris the function that takes\na hand from the domainand puts it in the range.So this is your range.You can change this\nfrom Range to Value.And this is where it gets cool.This is the percentage\nthat this playermade a three bet, given\nthat he had a chance towith each of these hands.And so you're going to notice\nsomething very different,right away.We have a whole lot\nof the 100s here.This player has made a three\nbet 100% with ace king suited,ace queen suited, ace jack\nsuited, ace 10, and acenine suited.Every time he had those\nhands, and he had a chance", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.175}, {"text": "to make a reraise, he did it.Every single time.But if you look at the\nactual

this report is fantastic\nfor helping you figure out,first of all, what would an\nopponent be seeing me do.What am I looking like?And then, well, what am\nI actually doing whenI get my hands in these spots?If you think, you know what, I\nshould never be making reraiseswith king, jack offsuit.And you come here,\nand you go, well, I'vebeen doing it 75% of the time,\nyou immediately know

your cards,\nstuff happens before you.And now it's your\nfirst decision.Well, the question is,\nwhat happened until then.If it's an unopened pot, that\nmeans everybody folded to you.So it's a similar\nkind of situation.So here, we can see we\nhave 10,434 hands wherethis player was the first\nto be able to open the pot.You can see the\nwinning percentage,you can see their VPIP and PFRs.So again, they're playing\na little more than 70%of hands in that spot,\nraising 60%-- a little more.But you can see one limper.Now a limper means someone\njust called the big blind.It's a technical term.It means there's one person\nwho just called the big blind.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.126}, {"text": "And it's to them.We have 1,945 hands for that.You can see how\ntheir VPIP changes.Suddenly, they're not putting\nin nearly as much money.Part of the reason for\nthis is this sampleis based on heads up play.So when you check\nin the big blind,it's not considered voluntarily\nputting money in because youhaven't put any more money in.And you can only\nVPIP before the flop.After the flop is a\ntotally different animal.So VPIP preflop only.And that's a good\nthing to keep in mind.So that's why you see\nthis kind of big drop.But you can already see\nhow, looking at this report,I can tell you something\nabout this player's play.They check a lot when\nit's limped to them,and they're in the big\nblind, and its heads up play.So you can use these and,\nof course, this workslike the other reports.And all of your\nhands are down here.And so you can\nreplay these hands.You can do other filtering\nin addition to this.And it will help\nyou figure out whatyour play is in different\nfirst situation spots.And tournament\nplay-- this is goingto be huge because, when you're\nfacing an all in before you geta chance to act, your range\nis going to be very different,you're going to want to make\ndifferent decisions than youwill if everyone folds\nto you because you'reable to steal the blinds\na lot more liberally.And you're going to see,\nlater in the course,how aggressive you\ncan actually beas your chip stack gets small.So being able to look at\nthese different kinds of spotswill help you fine\ntune your gameand look at what you've actually\nbeen doing in those situations.So I've mentioned\nlots of reports.Do you need more than that?I'm glad you do because you can\ncreate custom reports in the MyReports section.In here, you can choose the\ntype of report, how to groupthe report, and how to show\nexactly what you want to see.So any of our stats can\nbe added to these reports.There's three kinds.A player report starts\nout by looking at handsthat you've played.You're looking at\ngroups of hands.So a stat like VPIP\nlooks at groups of handsbecause it's a how\noften you voluntarilyput money in the pot\nover a sample of hands.That's to contrast with a\nHand Report, which is goingto show you one row per

big blinds.They're not in m.You get a pretty\nnice nice range.And you can kind\nof approximate mby multiplying that\nby 2/3 because you'regoing to be dividing it\nby the small blind, too.So you can see here,\nthis player hadthe stack less than two\nbig blinds 59 times.And this is how\noften they raisedwhen it was folded to them.And you can see it's 47%.So you can see, in this\nspot, how

use that as the default\nmodel to rank hands.But if you don't like that,\nyou can actually go in,and you make your\nown custom model.You can say, you\nknow what, I wantthree, two suited to be\nthe best hand in the deckbecause I love it.You can do that.You can put that at the top.We also have hand versus three\nrandoms as a default model.It ranks hands based on\ntheir equity against threerandom sets of hole cards.It's going to look\nvery different.It's going to be a lot more\nskewed towards high cards.So you're going to\nsee things like king,jack offsuit and queen,\njack offsuit longbefore you see low pocket pairs.So that's going to make things\nradically different in termsof using the percentages.There's also this\nGroup Select button,which will save you time.If you want to do\nany

straight.You have the absolute\nbest straight.If you have nine, eight\non that same board,you still have a straight,\n8, 9, 10, jack, queen,but ace, king still is a\nbetter straight than you.So you

our software\nwill tell you whatpercentage of the time\nsomebody did something,given that he had a chance to.So it's this very simple\nmathematical formula.How often did do\nit, how often did hehave a chance do it, turn\nit into a percentage.Done.How often did he\nactually three-betdivided by how often he\nhad a chance to three-bet.Multiply by 100.If it's 1% of the time when\nhe three bets, he has a hand.So let's go through\na few examples.VPIP, we've already\ntalked about a bunch.So it's the\npercentage of the timea player chose to put\nmoney in before the flop.This is considered one\nof the staple statsbecause it really speaks\nto how much a player isinvolved in the pot.If you've been sitting at\na casino and you see a guythat's just splashing\nmoney every hand.He's playing every hand.He doesn't care.His VPIP is very high.And it's easier to\nthink about that playerwhen you start building\nmodels in your mind of whatdo players who have VPIPs do.And you can start to categorize\nplayers by VPIP numbers.So someone who has\na VPIP of 40 isgoing to have similar kinds\nof play style to someoneelse who has a VPIP\nof 40, even if youdon't know a whole lot else\nbecause this one will convergepretty quickly since\nthey will VPIP or notpretty much every hand.Raise First In is a little\nbit more restrictive,but I think it's one that's\nreally useful for youguys in tournament play.If

has a VPIP of 70\nand a Raise First In of two,they are calling all the time,\nbut they are not raising ever.So this starts to give you an\nidea of what kind of playerthey are.They're the kind of\nplayer who puts money in,but they are not willing\nto commit to a raise.They don't want to\nbring the stakes higher.They just want to go along\nwith whatever's happening.And some stats can be\nsuper crazy specific.So we've already talked\nabout what three-bets are.We've already talked\nabout what cbets are.There is a stat in\nour system calledFold To Raise After Flop Cbet\nin a Three-bet or Higher Pot.That's what 3upplus means.Three-bet or higher.So let's break this one down.It means that we made\na three-bet or higherbefore the flop.That is, we either three-bet\nor we four-bet or we fivr-bet,or we six-bet-- anything higher,\nbut we made the last raisebecause we made a\ncbet on the flop.So we made some\nlast raise preflopthat was at least a reraise.And on the flop, we\nhad a chance to bet,and we bet, and they raised\nus-- because they raised--and we folded to\nthat specific raise.You will not see this\nhappening in your tournamentsbecause you are going to\nbe too short to really getthese situations.In a cash game, this\ncan be really useful,once you have a few\nthousand hands on somebody.But as you can imagine,\nif we have this,we have a lot of other\nreally specific stats.So if you find something\nyou want to know more about,you can go through\nout stat list and findif there's something there\nthat already does it.And this is one\nwhere you

looking at a stat\ncalled call preflop squeeze.If you were looking through\nthe stats and you saw this.And you said, well,\nwhat is that situation.Well that situation\nis described herein details in the\ndetailed description.A squeeze is when someone has\nmade a raise and someone elsemade a call.And then, somebody\nthree-bets both of them.That projects an image\nof a lot of strength.This is talked about in\nHarrington on Hold 'emas a great way to make a\nmove because if someone makesan open raise for three big\nblinds and someone else calls,and you're sitting\nthere for 10 big blindsand you shovel all in,\nthe first player needsto decide what's the guy behind\nme who called going to do,and what's this guy doing.He's got to have\na big hand if he'sable to shove all\nin over both of us.So that raise is\ncall to squeeze.If you face a squeeze,\nand you call it,it will count for\nthis situation.If the player who made\nthe first raise folds,you still face the\nsqueeze if you called.So those are the two spots here.And you can see, we have the\ndetailed description thatexplains exactly what it was.And the formula gives you\nthe actual numbers we used.We don't say multiply\nby 100 here justto keep it a little bit simpler.We have these\ndetailed descriptionsfor every stat on the list.So if you are so inclined, you\ncan spend several hours readingthrough our entire stat list.And I think you will probably\nbe the first person who has everactually done it besides me.So all right.We've talked a lot\nabout opponentsand what opponent stats can be.How do you find them?How do I look at opponent\nstats in PokerTracker?This is going to be\nimportant because youneed to figure out\nwhat these numbers meanfor your various opponents.So the first way is in\nthe

really\nthree-bet with impunitybecause everyone's folding.And it's great.So you pick up the open\nraise, you pick up the blinds,you can make lots of money.You can see this guy is\ngood at picking spots.He's got 64%, 65%.This guy's terrible\nat picking spots.He's only been successful\none time in three.With 17 tournaments,\nit's probablysome number like that,\ntwo in six, one in three.So you

the bubble.Once one more player goes\nout, the tournament is over.That is the end\nof the tournament.And we want to look at times\nwe have king, queen offsuitbecause that hand's\nbeen bugging us.We don't need any\nother reason, but wehave a real situation here.So you go into the sidebar.You pick your Fifty50 flag.That will limit it to\nFifty50 tournaments.You go in to Hand Details,\nNumber of Players.Players dealt in a\nhand, six to six.So now we're looking\nat six handedplay in Fifty50 tournaments.Actions and Opportunities,\nPreflop, Post Big Blind--bang-- add that to filter.Now we're looking at big blind\nplay in a Fifty50 tournamentsix handed.Hand Values.We just turn on king, queen.That's king, queen\noffsuit there.King, queen suited\nis on the other side.And we go into Actions and\nOpportunities, Preflop,and turn on Opportunities,\nand turn on Faced All In.", "start": 3000.0, "heat": 0.28}, {"text": "We add those.We have all of our\nfilters right here.And so now, we have picked\nout our situation entirely.And we can look at our spot.We have two hands in our\ndatabase that match that.It may have felt like\nyou had a lot of data,but sometimes, when you\ngo and you look at it,it turns out you don't have\nas much as you thought.And that's OK.We're still going to look\nat one of those hands.We've got two hands here.We'll look at the second one.We're going to replay it.We're going to see it in\nthe PokerTracker replayer.So here is our spot.Let's take a moment to look at.We're in the big blind,\njust like we said.We have king and a queen.Fold, fold, fold, fold.And this guy pushes all in.So we're facing our\nall in from him.So our chip stack is 1,955.His chip stack was 725.Our blinds were 60 and 120.And there was a 15 chip ante.So we have 90 chips.These were from the ante here.So we have to choose if we\nwant to call his 605 chip bet,or we want to fold to it with\nking, queen here in this spot.So I want you to take\na second and thinkabout whether you would call\nhere or whether you would fold.Remember, if you call\nand you bust him,the tournament is over.You definitely win\nmoney because he's out.You are in the top,\nand you get more moneybased on your chip\nstack plus your but-in.If you fold here, he\nnow picks up 210 chips.He now has 935 chips.He's still the short stack, and\nwe're going to keep playing.You have a king and a queen.I want you to just take a second\nand think about our situation.The first thing you\nshould be thinking about,and I hope you were\nthinking about,right now, is what\nhands would hebe playing to make\nthis all in raise with.Obviously, he could have aces.Obviously, he could have kings.What other hand?How far down is he\ngoing to go whenhe makes this all in range?", "start": 3120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And before we can make any\nadjustments based on stats,we have to have a baseline\nbecause if we thinkthe baseline player is playing\nall in with any two cards here,it's going to radically\nchange how we adjust basedon his stats because if\nhe's tighter than average,tighter than average\nof 100% is goingto be very different than\ntighter than average of 10%.So think about what you think\nan unknown player would play.Start to build this\nmodel in your head.This is what all the\nbig name pros will do.They are able to\nhave a baseline modeland then adjust based on\nindividual characteristics.So think about that.Think about what kinds\nof hands he would play.Now let's add some stats.Now we're going\nto start refiningour model on this player.We've got a baseline idea in\nour head of what kinds of handshe's going to play.Now let's look.We have 73 hands of data.His VPIP is 11.So in this 73 hands\nthat this guy'sbeen playing, so it's probably\nabout two tournaments worthgiven the length of these terms.In two tournaments'\nworth, he has put moneyin 11% of the time-- 1 hand\nin 9, this guy is playing.That's it.Preflop raise, 1%.And I can tell you because\nI did double check.This means, of his 73 hands,\nhe raised preflop before thisexactly in only one time.That's it.Only once ever.In both tournaments\nwe've seen him play,he's only ever\nraised once before.I hope that that changes\nwhat hands you think this guyis going to play, at\nleast a little bit.Now we can look a little\nbit deeper in his statsand try to see if there's\nany information there.Let's look at his\nsmall blind statistics.This is the Tools pop-up here.We're just looking\nat the top half.There's some stuff\nin the bottom,but it's all postflop stuff,\nso it's not relevant right now.So let's just look\nat small blind here.His VPIP from the\nsmall blind is 13%.So one time out of eight, he put\nmoney in from the small blind.He has never raised\nfrom the small blind,ever, ever-- not once.So he did no raises of any kind.He seems to call\nacross all positions.", "start": 3240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So here are his callings.These are from the\npreflop section.You can see he calls\nfrom everywhere.He's called 4 out of 25 hands.He's called cold\ntwice, which meansyou call without having\nput money in the pot.You can't call cold\nfrom the blind.That's why these are\ngoing to be zeros.He limps behind\nlimpers 1 out a 7.So he's not attacking people\nwho just called big blind.He's not attacking people\nwho are acting weak.He is folding to a\nblind steal twice.When he's in a blind,\nhe's perfectly happyto give his blinds up.A blind steal is when you're\nin a blind and someonein the cutoff, or the\nbutton, the last twopositions who haven't put blind\nmoney in-- they make a raise.So when you're facing\na raise from them,it's called facing a steal.He's done that twice and\nhe folded both times.So you can start to\na piece all of thistogether and get an idea.But this sample is not huge.So think about what hands\nthis specific playeris likely to raise\nall in with, nowthat we have all of\nthis information.Remember, his tournament\nlife is on the line.If he is called, and he loses,\nhe is out of the tournament,he wins absolutely nothing.But he's the short stack.He has an m of about 2.7.He could go less than three\norbits before he is completelyout of chips, just by folding.So he has to make a\nmove at some point.He has to pick a hand\nand make a stand soon.So the fact that his\ntournament life is on the lineis going to make him\ntighter because he doesn'twant to lose the tournament.The fact that he is so\nshort with such a short m,is going to make him looser.So these kind of are in\nconflict with one another.And as you play\nmore tournaments,you're going to find\nout how they poll.Do you think this guy is going\nto play low pocket pairs?Do you think he's going\nto pick deuces here,and happy to play a coin\nflipper for his tournament life?I see one person\nshaking his head.What about weak aces?Do you think ace,\nfour offsuit is OK?Do you think he's willing\nto take his tournament", "start": 3360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "life into his hands with\njust a really weak ace?What about king, queen.Could we have the\nsame hand here?Would he make this\nshove with my hand?King, 10?Could we have him\ncompletely dominated?So that's another poker term.If you have the same\ncard and your other cardis better than theirs,\nit's called dominating.You're 70 to 30 favorite in\nthat spot-- something like that.A queen, jack-- same\nkind of situation.If he's willing to do\nit with these hands,then we're in a really\ngreat spot, right?We have to decide what this\nplayer would open raise with.So now we're starting\nto build that model.Remember, his VPIP is 11%,\nso let's start-- first,if you want to convert\npercentages to actual hands,the equity calculator\nin PokerTrackerwill help you with\nthis because it'skind of hard to know\nwhat 11% of hands is.Especially if you don't\nhave experience with it,you're like, I don't know.So you can come into\nthe equity calculator.And you can pop that open.And you can choose\nHand Range Selector.And then you can use\nthe slider, and youcan see what the model says.Again, we're still\nin Glansky-Carlson.You can play between the models.So this is 15%.So think about the\nhands that you've justdecided this guy's\nwilling to go all in with.Here's a 15% range according\nto Glansky-Carlson.Wider.Looser.So this guys is down to ace,\nfour suitedl down to king,10 suited; pairs, down to three\nnot twos; and down to ace,eight. that's 15% of all hands.Well, we said he'll play 11% of\nhands, overall over 73 hands.So let's start by saying,\nany hand in the top 11%.He'll play those.It's not going to be perfect.Our sample's not fantastic.We know this, but we're trying\nto get an idea for what'sright to do here in the spot.So this is the top 11%.You don't have the\nbottom two pairs.You don't have any\nweak aces at all.Even ace, nine is\nconsidered a middling ace.", "start": 3480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So that's not too bad.He has no weak suited aces.That's a 11% range.That's a pretty strong range.So PokerTracker also has a built\nin calculator that does ICM.ICM stands for the\nIndependent Chip Model.This has been out there\nfor a little while.And what the ICM does is\nit takes tournament chipsand converts them to\nreal world dollarsbecause tournament chips\nand real world dollarsdon't have a one\nto one correlationbecause your last\ntournament chip isworth a lot more than\nyour thousandth tournamentchip, if you have 1,000 chip\nstack-- because once you'reout, you can win nothing.But that extra chip\ndoesn't mean quite as much.So this model takes your\nequity, your total chip stack,and gives you a result as\nan equity in the prize pool.It says, with this chip\nstack, if everythingwere even-- ceteris paribus--\nnothing else to be considered,this is what your\nequity in the prize poolshould be according\nto the model.This has been there in the\nreplayer the entire time.I don't know if you noticed\nit, but if you click it,it will show you the\nresults in this spot.So we're going to be looking at\nthe times we face this all in,and we will see what\nthe average model sayswhether we should push or fold\nin this spot with this hand.So who thinks we should\ncall his all in raise,if he was an average player?Everyone else I\npresume says fold.The default model says call.Everyone who raised\nyour hand, you guys win.So you can click the\nblue results link here,you can see the full ICM tree.But the important\nthing to note right nowis you can look and see\nwhat your prize poolequity is, right here.If you push, you can\nsay you would have,against the average model,\na 15.83% equity in the prizepool.If you fold, 15.28%.Now keep in mind, this is just\nagainst the average model.This is not based\non anything we'vedone specifically to\nanalyze this player.But the good news is,\nwe can change that.", "start": 3600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And we can see what\nthe model's range was.So when we click\nresults, we're goingto see what the model says the\naverage player would raise allin with in this spot.And the default range is--\ndrum roll, please-- 33.9%.The default model says\nthe average playerwill raise all in\nwith an m of 2.7,when folded to in the small\nblind with about 34% of hands.We built this model using some\npretty robust data analysis.But as we've seen, different\nplayers play very differently.And this player is most\ncertainly not averagebecause we put him on somewhere\nmuch tighter than 33.9%.And you can see push\nequity here and foldequity or not that different.We're only talking\n0.6% of the prize pool.So if we're playing\na $10 tournament,we're talking about the\ndifference between an expectedresult of $0.60.It's not huge, but each\nlittle edge in pokeradds up, one piece right\non top of the other.And making these decisions\nin the marginal spotsis really how you can\nexpand your advantageand play better\nthan your opponents.So let's change that.So you can click right\nhere, once you've beenlooking at the model results.You can change his range.So this, by the way,\nis what 33% looks like.So the average player here\nshoving as weak as queen,eight suited; king, two\nsuited; king, six offsuit;any pair; any ace.That's a lot of hands.These are weak, weak hands.So we change it.We'll drag the slider down\nfrom 33.8% down to 11%.Suddenly, now we're looking\nat a whole lot tighter range.With the updated range,\nwho thinks it's a call now?Good, I'm glad nobody thinks\nit's a call because itis in fact, a fold.So by looking at this\nplayer, by doing analysisof his previous play, we were\nable to turn a close callinto a close fold.And so in this spot,\nwhen he has this range,our push equity is 14.85% and\nfold equity is 15 and 1/4%.", "start": 3720.0, "heat": 0.197}, {"text": "And you can actually\nplay with this.And you can keep changing\nand updating the range.And you can figure out\nwhat break even is.So if he knew what\nour cards, were,if we turned them face\nup, we can figure outwhat's the game theory optimal\npushing range for him, right?When we turn our king, queen up,\nif he could play perfect poker,he would have\npushed a 24% range.That would be king, nine\nsuited; any ace; any pair;queen, ten suited; king,\n10 offsuit, or better.If we think he is\npushing less than that,it's definitely a fold for us.If he is pushing more\nthan that, it's a call.So we now have established\nwhat a break evenrange is for us facing a\npush from a short stackat the end of a tournament in\na tournament type that we play.So next time that we're\nsitting in the big blind,and we face a shove from\na short stack, who'sin the small blind,\nwe have a better ideaof what things to look at\nand how much to skew thingsbased on his range.If you're starting\nto see 50%, 60%,and you're sitting with king,\nqueen, you're in a great spotto call, assuming you're in\na otherwise similar situationwith your chips relative\nto the rest of the table.But in this spot, against\nthis guy, it's a fold.So of course, in the\nactual tournament,hero called because you\nalways make the wrong playthe first time you're\nin the situation.So hero called here with\nking, queen offsuit.And we get a lovely,\nwonderful flop.We've got the king, nine, two.So hurray, we hit our pair.This is great.Your heart starts racing.There's the turn.It's an offsuit seven.Fantastical.If he has two diamonds, he\ndoesn't have a flush yet.None of the straights came in.Uh-oh.There's another diamond.So now if he has two diamonds,\nhe could have a flush.One of the hands that was\nin his range was ace, king.If he has ace, king,\nhe also beats is.So if he has queens, kings,\naces, ace king, or any twodiamonds, he wins.And of course, his actual\nhand was ace, five offsuit.", "start": 3840.0, "heat": 0.427}, {"text": "I want to point out\nthat ace, five offsuitwas not in our range\nanalysis for him.So our range was\nactually too tight.So in the future,\nwhen we're tryingto do this kind of analysis, we\ncan update our range by saying,hey, the last time I\ndid an analysis of a guythat I thought was really\ntight, when he was super short,he was looser than I thought.You can add those\nextra few percentin when you're updating\nyour ranges later.No worries about ace, king.Certainly no flush.He did have one diamond though.So here are our take aways.You should think about poker as\na series of discrete decisionsthat you're going to\nmake when you're playing.You can use PokerTracker's\nfilter systemto target those very\nspecific decisions.As we've seen, you can\nfilter for anythingunder the sun you would like.You can save filters for later.So target those.Pick the spots that bug you.Pick the spots that\nyou're going to remember.Next time you have six, six,\nand you're out of position,and it's on the flop, and\nthere's a king up there,and you made a raise\npreflop, and you're not surewhether you should bet\nor you should check,you can pick that spot\nand you can look at it.And when you check, call,\nthen the turn is a queen,you can decide, do I want to\ncheck or do I want to bet.You can pick these spots.And then when the river 10\ncomes, it just sucks to be you.You can use the\navailable informationto build a mental model\nof your opponents.Look, this is the way\npeople play poker.You try to imagine what's going\non in your opponent's head.You try to go, how is this\nplayer going to think.How does he make decisions.So that's what I'm\ncalling this mental model.It's all of the\nheuristics that'sgoing on in his head or her head\nto make a specific decision.Analyze your options based\non your mental model.Think about what you can do.Think about how his actions\nare going to affect your play.Think about how your\nhand affects it.And when your mental model\nis proven wrong, like it justwas, we did not think that\nguy had ace, five offsuit,you can adjust your model.And you will get better at\npoker if you continue to analyze", "start":
