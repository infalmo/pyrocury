[{"text": "[SQUEAKING]\n[RUSTLING] [CLICKING]SCOTT HUGHES: Good afternoon.So we spent our last\nlecture laying outsome of the basic foundations,\nmaking a couple of definitions.I want to quickly recap\nthe most important conceptsand definitions.And then, let me\nbe blunt, I kind ofwant to get through\nthese definitions, whichI think it's important\nto do them precisely,but there's nothing\nsignificantly challengingabout them.We just need to make sure they\nare defined very precisely.So now that you've kind of\nseen the style of these things,I would like to sort of\nmove through the next batchof these definitions\nquickly enoughthat we can start to move into\nmore interesting material.So a quick recap--and my apologies,\nmy daughter hassome kind of a virus that I am\ndesperately trying to make sureI do not catch.And so I will be hydrating\nduring this lecture.So I just want to recap some of\nthe most important concepts wewent over.So this whole class\nis essentiallya study in spacetime.Later, we're going to\nconnect spacetime to gravity.And general relativity\nis going to becomethe relativistic\ntheory of gravity.So we began with a fairly\nmathematical definition.Spacetime is a\nmanifold of eventsthat is endowed with a metric.Manifold, for our\npurposes, is essentiallyjust a set in\nwhich we understandhow different members of the\nset are connected to each other.Events are really just when\nand where something happens.We haven't precisely\ndefined metric yet.We will soon.But intuitively, just\nregard it as some kindof a mathematical object that\ngives me a notion of distancebetween these events.I tried and I will\ncontinue to tryto be very careful\nto make a distinctionbetween geometric\nobjects that livein the manifold, the\nevents themselveswith things like a\ndisplacement vector between twoevents, other\nvectors, which I willrecap the definition\nof in just a moment.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.284}, {"text": "They have an existence and\nsort of a reality to themthat is deeper and\nmore fundamentalthan the representation\nof that object.So when I say that the\ndisplacement vector is delta t,delta x, delta y, delta z, that\nis according to observer O.And when I write that down--I will be very careful\nas much as possible.I will occasionally\nscrew this up--but I will try to\nwrite this downwithout using an equal sign.Equal sign implies\na degree of realitythat I do not want to impart\nto that representation.So an equal dot with\na little o here,that's my personal\nnotation for deltax is represented\nby these componentsaccording to observer O. And for\nshorthand, I was sometimes justwrite this by the collection\nof indices delta x alpha.A different observer\nO bar, they willrepresent this this factor\nusing the exact same geometricobject.They all agree that it's\nthis displacement between twophysical events in spacetime.But they assign different\ncoordinates to it.They give a different\nrepresentation to it.And we find that representation\nusing a Lorenz transformation.And I'm not going to\nwrite out explicitlythe Lorenz transformation\nmatrix lambda.I gave it in the last lecture.And I'm assuming you're all\nexperts in special relativity,and I don't need\nto go over that.So I will then\nusing this as sortof the prototype, the\ngeneral notion of a vectorin spacetime, which\nwe'll often calla 4-vector for\nthe obvious reasonthat it has 4\ncomponents, I'm goingto treat that as any quartet of\nnumbers that has transformationproperties just like\nthe displacement factorI just went over.So if there's some\nquantity A thathas time like an x\nor y and z component,as long as a different\nobserver, for reasons havingto do with the\nunderlying physicsor whatever the\nheck this A is, aslong as that different observer\nrelates their componentsto observer O's components\nvia the Lorenz transformation,you got yourself a 4-vector.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.122}, {"text": "Any random set of four\nnumbers, that ain't a 4-vector.You need to have some\nphysics associated with it.And the physics has\nto tell it that it'sa thing that's related by\na Lorenz transformation.So I want to pick\nup this discussionby introducing four\nparticularly importantand special vectors,\nwhich to be honest,we're not going to use\ntoo much beyond someof the first couple of\nweeks or so of the course,but they're very useful.And one should often bear in\nmind, even later in the coursewhen they've sort\nof disappeared,that they're coming along\nfor the ride secretly.And these are basis vectors.So if I go into frame O--I'm just going to pick some\nparticular reference frame--I can immediately write\ndown four special vectors.So remember, this is a Cartesian\ntype of coordinate system.So I'm going to introduce e0.I'm going to represent\nthis by just the number 1in the time slot and\n0 everywhere else.e1, or ex if you\nprefer, I'm goingto write that down like so.And you can kind of see\nwhere I'm going with this.The analogy, if you've all seen\nunit vectors in other classes,hopefully this is fairly\nobvious what I'm doing.I'm just picking out\na set of, you know,little dimensionless

delta.Yeah, so what that does\nis it just emphasizes thatat least in-- by\nthe way, I shouldput little o's underneath all\nof these things, because Ihave chosen this according to\nobserver o's representation.So this is just saying that\na coin to observer O, theseare four very special vectors.The utility of these things--up high for everyone in\nback to be able to see--the utility of doing\nthis is that if I nowwant to write the vector\nA as a geometric object,I can combine the components\nthat observer O useswith the basis vectors\nthat observer O uses.And I can sum them all

out of sync\nwith one another.I caught that one.I don't always.OK?So if you see\nsomething like thatand you kind of go, um, why\ndid that alpha magically turninto a beta, it's\nprobably a mistake.",

don't yet know how\nto get the barred basisvectors from the\nunbarred basis vectors.But I know that they exist.And that once I know what they\nare, this equation is true.OK?These are just\ntwo different waysof writing this\ngeometric object, whichevery observer agrees\nhas its existence thattranscends the representation.So let's rewrite what I've\ngot on the right-hand sideof the

moveleft and right, front and back.It's a little bit of effort.I can move up and down.But I cannot say, oh, crap, I\nleft my phone at home I'll goback 15 minutes and pick it up.You cannot move

propertiesas the displacement vector.We can similarly define an\ninner product of a 4-vectorwith itself.OK, now, I'll put\nthis on another board.So A dot A, I'm going\nto define this--or rather I will
