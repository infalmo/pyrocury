whichis the notion of stem cells.In fact, I'm going to discuss\ntwo things, the first of whichis another concept\nthat you need,following on from the\nconcepts we had rightat the beginning of lecture.I feel like this microphone--The first is a concept that you\nneed in addition to the oneswe started lecture\nwith, and thenwe'll talk about stem cells.So today, we'll\ntalk about potency,and then we'll talk\nabout stem cells.Potency, along with\nfate, determination,and differentiation,\nis one of those termsthat you need to know and you\nneed to understand in orderto understand stem cells.Potency refers to the\nnumber of possible fatesthat a cell can acquire,\nnumber of possible fates", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "open to a cell.And this is a very important\nconcept of developmentbecause, in general,\npotency decreases with age,and decreases as different\nparts of the organismbecome specialized.So in general, potency\ndecreases with age.But I will put in\nhere, and we'llexplore this more in a moment,\nexcept for some stem cells.And we haven't defined a\nstem cell yet, but we will.What kinds of\npotencies are there?There's the big one,\ntotipotent, wherea cell can become all fates.And there's really\nonly one cell thatcan do this in the normal\nanimal, and is the zygote.And in most animals,\neven as the zygotebecomes just two\ncells or a few cells,that full potency is lost.And cells instead,\nin the embryo,are multi or pluripotent, which\nmeans that they can acquiremany fates, but not all fates.Embryonic cells, especially\nin the early embryo,and many stem cells\ncan also become,are also multipotent\nor pluripotent.And then as time progresses--\nis that a hand up?", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Yes, sir.AUDIENCE: How do you reconcile\nthe fact that human cells,we can separate them.Even at the eight cell stage.HAZEL SIVE: That's\na great question.The question is\nhow do I reconcilewhat I'm telling\nyou with the factthat you can get\nidentical sextuplets,or octuplets actually?It's a good question.That's true.In different animals, the\nvery early embryonic cellsare sometimes totipotent\nup to a while.OK?And so for example,\nin armadillo,here's a piece of, you know,\nfact for your back pockets.In the armadillo, the\neight-cell embryo almost alwayssplits into eight single\ncells, each of whichbecomes a baby armadillo.OK?So those cells are totipotent.In mice, even at\nthe two cell stage,the two mouse cells are\nprobably not equivalently potentand they're not totipotent.So very, very seldom--almost never-- get\nidentical mouse twins.OK?So it's one of\nthese generalities.And if you ask me, you get the\nspecifics are a bit different.As cell fate\nrestriction continues,cells can become\nbipotent, or unipotent,whereby one or just two\nfates are open to them.And so if we look,\ntaking this concept,let's now start the\nlecture about stem cells.You're going to\nneed this concept.Stem cells, I'll point\nout, whatever they are,got almost 3,000 hits\nyesterday on Google News.This is way below\nbaseball, which got 45,000.I checked.But still, you know,\nas science topics go,stem cells are really up there.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And they're on the covers of\nmagazines, over and over again.And we'll talk more\nabout why that is.Here's a diagram-- it's\nnot on your handouts--that I drew for you.Let's not dwell on it.But let's now move\non to Topic Number2, which will fold in\nthis concept of potencyand the concepts of\nfate, determination,and differentiation, and\ntalk about stem cells.And let's do, as is\nour custom, let'sdefine what a stem cell is.I think that a stem\ncell can be definedas a cell of\nvariable potency thathas the capacity to self-renew.Cells of variable potency\nthat can self-renew.They can make more\nof themselves.Despite the hype, despite\ncovers of Time Magazineand almost every front\npage of every newspaperacross the world, stem cells are\nnormally found in our bodies.And normally, as\nwe'll explore, they'reused for organ maintenance\nand repair, organ maintenanceand repair.But the thing, you know,\nthat has everyone fired upis that you can somehow\nharness these cellsfor therapeutic purposes.And that you can repair what the\nbody cannot, by being clever,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.135}, {"text": "and using the power of these\ncells as they normally have it,or as you can give it to them.And so there's this question\nof therapy and therapeutic stemcells, where the idea, again, is\nthat you would repair a damagedorgan by introducing\nsomehow, injectingor otherwise introducing, extra\nor somehow special stem cells--which I am going to\nabbreviate heretofore as SC--by introducing extra stem\ncells into a damaged body.Does this work?It does work.It works for the\nhematopoietic system,as in bone marrow transplants.And it also works for\nskin cell transplants.Well, let's just put skin cells.OK.Skin stem cells can be\ngrown from your own skin.And in the case of\nburn victims, thishas really saved\ncountless lives.The original technology\nbegan to be developed hereat MIT by Professor Howard\nGreen, who is now at Harvard.But the idea is\nto take your skinand grow it on\nsomething like gauzeor some kind of\nsome solid support,", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.18}, {"text": "and then to cover a burn patient\nwith layers of support on whichthere are some stem cells.And these stem cells will\nhelp fill in the holesin the skin left by the burn.Normally when a wound heals,\nas I'm sure you've noticed,it heals from the sides.The only way a wound can\nheal is from the side.And if it's a big wound, it\ncan take a very, very long timeto heal.And you can get\ninfections and so onwhile the healing\nprocess is going on.So seeding the inside of a\nwound with stem cells thatcan start the skin\nregeneration processand seal up the body\nagainst infection,that's been incredibly useful.And we'll talk more about bone\nmarrow transplants in a moment.OK.We previously talked about this\nprocess by which cells decide,are undecided\ninitially, they decidewhat they're going to become.And then they differentiate\ninto their final function.Stem cells fit into\nthis litany somewherebetween the commitment stage\nand the differentiation stage.And in this diagram,\nthese multiple arrowsare there for a reason.There are multiple steps between\ncommitment and differentiation.And somewhere along the way, a\ngroup of cells with capacitieswe'll talk about,\nleaves this lineageand sits around and waits,\npartially determined,so that it can go on and make\nmore differentiated cells whenthey're needed.And I've added on there the\npotency timeline, decreasingwith age, of the\ndeveloping animal.But let's diagram the notion\nof stem cells on the board.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.225}, {"text": "Stem cells generally\ndivide slowly.Here's one.It's a variable potency.It may be multipotent.It may be bipotential.And it is somewhat\ncommitted, which isa slightly difficult concept.Because last time\nwe talked aboutcommitted versus uncommitted.But now I'm telling\nyou somethingcan be somewhat committed.And that gets to\nthis multiple arrowsthere were as cells progress\nin their fate decisions,they change their\nmolecular signatureand they really do\nbecome closer and closerto a cell that's\nmade a decision.But it's kind of like, you\nknow, if you're weighing upgoing to med school or\ngoing to graduate schoolin bioengineering,\nyou know, you havedecided that it will\nbe one or the other,but you haven't decided which.You're somewhat committed.And then when you\nmake the decisionto go to graduate school, you\nhave now become committed.OK?So the cell is doing the\nsame kind of notion there.There's your stem\ncell, variable potency.Under the correct\nstimulus, that stem cellwill divide to give rise\nto two different cells.One is another stem cell.And the other is something\nwe'll call a progenitor.The progenitor is more\ncommitted than the stem cell.The progenitor cell\nis going to go onand divide, usually a lot.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.369},

talk about the discovery\nof stem cells, because thisis something that really\nwas pivotal in helpingunderstand whether or not there\nwas some way that the bodynormally repaired itself.It was clear that during\nearly development,there was lots of cell\ndivision and lots of changes.Cell types were formed\nand organs were formed.But it really wasn't\nclear in the adulthow much repair there was,\nhow much turnover of tissuesthere were, and really what\nthe whole dynamic processof maintaining the adult was.And the discovery of\nstem cells came aboutbecause people looked to\nsee how long cells lived.And what they found\nwas found usinga turnover assay that measures\nthe half life of cells.And they found that\nin almost all organs,in fact, probably in all organs,\ncells did not live forever.They turned over.They died.And they were\nreplaced by new cells.And this turnover assay\nimplied that therewas some kind of replacement.And the cells doing\nthe replacementwere called stem cells.You find this by a pulse/chase\nassay, which we'll go over", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.47}, {"text": "on your handout in a moment.And what was found was really\nvariable for different organs.Firstly, all organs,\nabout, show cell turn over.Red blood cells have a half\nlife of about 120 days.There are a lot of red\nblood cells in your body.And in fact, that implies\nthat there are about 10to the seventh new red\nblood cells made a day.In your intestine,\nthe half life of cellsis three to five days,\nin the small intestine.And the hair on your head has a\nhalf life of about four years.So it's variable for\ndifferent kinds of cells.If you look at\nyour first handout,it diagrams a\npulse/chase assay wherea cell population is labeled\nwith a nucleotide analog.It's a normal nucleotide, but\nit's got a bromine added to it.And it acts like deoxythymidine,\ngets incorporated into DNA,and you give just a short pulse\nof this nucleotide analog.So only some of the\ncells get labeled.And you only give\nit for a short time.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.42}, {"text": "So you get a labeled\ncell population.And then you stop the\nlabeling by addinglots of unlabeled thymidine,\nand that's called a chase.And you follow the cells\nover this long chase period.And then you can watch and see\nwhat happens to those cellsthat you initially labeled\nover a very short time.And so in this example, I've got\nfour cells initially labeled.Over time, they're\nonly two cells left.And if you measure the time\nfrom going from four cellsto two cells, you can get to\nthe half life of that cellpopulation.OK?You can also-- if you don't\nhave a handout for this,just look on the screen--you can also follow the\nlabeled cell populationand see what those cells become.And you can see that they\ngo on to differentiateas particular cell types.So this is a kind\nof way of labelingthe lineage of these cells.And that is useful, too.This was the theory behind\nstem cell definition.But what is a stem\ncell look like,and how do you isolate one?It turns out that\nthat's really difficult.So isolation and\nassay in the adultstem cells are very, very rare.And that is one of\nthe issues with usingstem cells for therapy.There are very few of them\nand they're hard to isolate.Hematopoietic stem\ncells compriseabout 0.01% of the\nbone marrow, whichis where the stem\ncells reside, and wherethe precursors of your whole\nblood and immune system reside.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.372}, {"text": "The way that this\nwas dealt with wasthrough a really\nclever techniquethat has the acronym of FACS.I'll give you a\nslide in a moment.It stands for Fluorescence\nActivated Cell Sorting.We'll go to a slide\nin a moment so wedon't have to spell it out.And the idea behind FACS is\nthat you label stem cells.And you might be guessing\nwhat to label them with.But you label them usually via\ntheir cell surface proteinswith some kind of tag,\noften an antibody tag.And then you can use that tag\nto make them different colors.And you can then sort\nthem, cell by cell,through the Special Fluorescence\nActivated Cell Sorter.Sort individual\ncells, and then youcan assay individual cells\nor small groups of themfor stem cell properties.Let's look at a slide of how\nthe FACS, the FluorescenceActivated Cell Sorter works.No, let's not.I've really gotten\nahead of myself here.And I'm going to go back\nbecause I want to show you this.Hold on to that\nthought and let'sgo back to this notion\nof a pulse/chase assay.I forgot that I had this here.This is really important.This is a pulse/chase\nassay of intestinal cells.And so your small intestine\nlies inside your belly.And if you look\nat its anatomy, itcontains many\ntubes whose surface", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.403}, {"text": "is thrown into folds\nto increase the surfacearea for food absorption.And if you look at these folds,\nthey are very closely packed.So you get a huge\nsurface area increase.And the cells of\nthese folds thatare doing the food\nabsorption turn overevery three to five days.Those are the ones\nI was talking about.So if you blow up one\nof these folds, whichis called a villus,\nthere's the partthat's sticking up\ninto the cavity,into the lumen of\nthe small intestine.And then there's this\npart that kind of dipsdown into the lining\nof the intestine, whichis called a crypt.The stem cells lie somewhere\nat the base of the crypt.It's not exactly clear where.But the idea is that somewhere\nat the bottom of this cryptthere are these stem cells\nthat under specific conditionswill start to proliferate.And they will move\nup into the villusand replace the villus\ncells that are dying.You can monitor this by doing\na pulse/chase experiment.So here's the crypt.And they've given,\nin this experiment,a pulse of thymidine\nhas been given.And you're looking\nkind of at time 0,right after the pulse of\nthymidine has been given.Here the cells, the black\ncells are in the crypt.They're labeled.And then if you\nlook over time, youcan see that these black cells\nmove away from the crypt.They're moving up\ninto the villus.And here they are actually\nright on top of the villus,replacing the cells\nthat were turning over.So that's a really\nbeautiful demonstrationof a pulse/chase assay.OK.Now we can go to our\nFluorescence Activated CellSorter.The idea is that you\ntake a mix of cells--you don't have this\non your handout,just look on the screen--\nthe cells are labeledwith fluorescent antibodies.And you put them into\na reservoir and dropletgenerator.And the cells drop out of\nthis reservoir, one at a time.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.486}, {"text": "And as they drop out,\nthey go past a laser.And you can tune the laser to\nwhatever wavelengths you want.It excites the cells.And if the cells emit in\nthe particular wavelengthyou're interested in, the\ndetector will detect that.And then it actually\ngives a charge to the cellthat it is the\ncorrect fluorescence.And as the cells\nare dropping down,the cells of the correct\ncolor are deflectedby an electric charge.And different color\ncells can be collectedinto different flasks.OK?This really works.It's a fantastic machine.You can collect cells\nabout, you know,you can collect millions\nof cells an hour.It's pretty quick.But you do it one\ncell at a time.And in that way, you\ncan isolate cells, whichhave got stem cell properties.OK.So you've used\nyour FACS machine.You've got cells that\nlook as though they'vegot stem cell properties.And now, let's look at the\nassays that may be used.And there are three assays\nthat you should know.One is a repopulation assay\nto test stem cellness.And this is a transplant assay\nwhere you're transplanting testcells, test stem\ncells, into the adult.And you have removed from the\nadult, endogenous cells thatmight be competing\nwith those stem cells.That would include\nthe stem cells.We'll go through a\nslide in a moment.I'm going to list them here.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.713}, {"text": "Another one is an\nin-vitro induction assay,where you are going\nto take isolated cellsand you're going to treat\nthem with various inducers,various signaling\nmolecules, and you'regoing to test and see what\nfates those cells can acquire.And a third assay is called\nan embryo incorporation assay,where you are going to take\ncells that may be stem cells,and you're going to test\nthem in a chimeric embryo.Let's go through\nyour next slidesto discuss each of these points.Bone marrow transplants resulted\nin a Nobel Prize in 1990for E. Donnall Thomas\nand Joseph Murray.It's a technique that\nsaved millions of lives,and here how it\nworks in a mouse.You take the mouse and\nyou irradiate the mouseto destroy the bone marrow\nand the stem cells associatedwith the bone marrow.If it's a person, to destroy\nthe diseased burned bone marrow.And then you replace that bone\nmarrow with normal bone marrowto either try to make the\nperson better, or in this case,to test something\nabout stem cells.The irradiated mouse\nor person would die,but the normal bone marrow\nwill cause the mouse to live.And if you've put stem\ncells into that mouse,you can start getting them out\nof that mouse whose life youhave saved, and isolate\nmore stem cells.Those kinds of assays\nled to the definitionof the hematopoietic stem cell.Here it is.It's a pluripotent stem\ncell that gives riseto all of these different kinds\nof cells, the immune cells,and all of the blood cells.It's a very, very\npowerful stem cell.", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.19}, {"text": "And the ability to actually make\nthis diagram and say that therewas a single cell that gave rise\nto all these different lineageswas because of a titration\nassay where you could take theseputative hematopoietic stem\ncells that were difficultto isolate-- and still haven't\nbeen isolated in their purity--but you can titrate them down.And you can introduce what you\nthink is one stem cell, 10 stemcells, 100 stem cells, and so\non, into an irradiated mouse,and ask how many\nstem cells does ittake to repopulate the entire\nblood system and immune system.And it turns out,\nyou have to mixthese cells with carrier cells,\notherwise it doesn't work.But it turns out that\none cell can repopulatethe entire hematopoietic system,\nwhich is really extraordinary,and led to the diagram that I\nshowed you in the slide before.OK.Here's another assay.This is an in-vitro\ninduction assay.And the idea here is\nthat you start offwith something, which you\nthink might be stem cells,by various criteria.And then to test what\nthese cells can do,you put them into plastic\ntissue culture dishes,and you add some\nnutrients and so onto allow the cells to divide.And then you add some inducers.And you remember a\ncouple of lectures back,inducers are just ligands for\nvarious signaling systems.You might add fibroblast\ngrowth factor to this one,and retinoic acid to\nthat one, and then youask what happens to the cells.They will go on, in\ngeneral, to differentiateinto different cell types.And depending on what\nthey differentiate into,you can say something about the\npotency of these putative stemcells.You can't test if they're\nreally stem cells,but you can say something\nabout their potency.You can do a similar experiment,\nbut in a whole mouse.The mouse is made\nfrom, the embryois made from a part of the\nvery early embryo called", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.183}, {"text": "the inner cell mass.And you can inject labeled,\nputative stem cellsinto an early mouse embryo,\ninto this inner cell masspart of the embryo, put it into\na mother, a recipient mother,and then ask what comes\nout, what kind of embryocomes out of that process.And if you see that\nthe baby that comes outof this chimeric embryo has got\na green liver and green earsand green whiskers, you'll\nknow that these cells that youput into the chimeric\nembryo, that you madethe chimeric embryo\nwith, had the capacityto give liver,\nears, and whiskers.OK?So this is a powerful\nassay to, again,look at the potency of\ncells, not, in this case,the stem cellness of cells.One of the things\nabout stem cellsis that you only\nwant them to workwhen you want them to work.If you cut yourself,\nin the normal processof keeping your\nliver the right size,in the normal process of keeping\nyour heart muscle correct,you want your stem cells\nto be working and keepingeverything homeostatic.You don't want them to be\ndividing out of control,because then you'll get cancer.And so something has to\ncontrol what stem cells doand when they do it.And this is a\nquestion of regulationand the notion of\na stem cell niche.Stem cells are kept\nquiescent, usually in G0that we talked about in\nthe cell cycle lecture.And they're kept quiescent by\nsignals from the surroundingcells.So their cell-cell\ninteraction, and by signals", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.288}, {"text": "from the surrounding cells.And those are given a special\nname by stem cell biologists.They're not that special, but\nthey're given a special name.They're called niche\ncells, or the niche.OK?They're just surrounding cells\nthat are secreting signals.On some kind of activation--you cut yourself, your organ\nnormally needs repair--things change.So on activation, by some\nkind of environmental input--local or less local--niche cells induce the\nstem cells to divide.And they do this--and they induce the\nstem cells to divideinto a stem cell plus a\nprogenitor, which then goes onto do all the things that I\ndiagrammed that progenitors do,on the first board.And the niche cells\ndo this because theyhave changed their signaling.This is yet another use,\nor a very related use,of the notion of cell-cell\nsignaling in controlling life.Here's a diagram.Here are niche cells.You don't have this.Just look on the screen.Surrounding cells,\nmaintaining stem cells quiet.When there's an environmental\ninput, the niche cells change.They activate the stem cells\nto divide and form more stemcells and progenitor cells.", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.311}, {"text": "One really fantastic\nexample of the niche,and the interaction between\nstem cells and the niche,is in the hair.This is from my colleague\nElaine Fuchs at Rockefeller,who over many years has figured\nout that in the hair follicle--this is the hair sticking\nout of the skin--in the hair, there's\na small groupof cells on one side of the hair\nshaft called the bulge cells,and these bulge cells\nare the stem cells.Her investigators\nisolated these bulge cellsand did the following\nexperiment to showthat they were hair stem cells.There's a kind of a mouse\ncalled a nude mouse thathas a very bad immune system.So it's useful for immune\nsystem experiments.But it also has no hair.And you can do a\ntransplant into this mouseof these bulge cells.And you get little tufts\nof hair growing wherethe rest of the mouse is nude.And you've done a\ncareful experimentwhere you've labeled the cells\nyou have transplanted in sothat you can show\nthat they actuallycame from the transplanted\ntissue and notfrom the mouse, the\nnude mouse tissue.And you can do that because\nyou labeled them with GFPand they're green.So this the green hair.And it shows you that these\nbulge cells are stem cells.During the life of a hair--your hair has a life,\nwe discussed four yearson your head--during the life of a hair, the\nbulge cells and the niche cellsare in different places.And depending on whether they're\ntouching or far apart from oneanother, there's induction\nof hair growth or not.So at a particular stage\nof the hair cycle--this is called the hair\ncycle, look on the bottomof the screen here--the bulge cells and\na group of cellscalled the dermal\npapilla that lies rightat the bottom of the hair\nshaft are touching one another.And at that point, a\nparticular signaling pathway", "start": 2160.0,

bulge cellsmove away from the\ndermal papilla cells.Here they are during\ngrowth, the growth period.You see the bulge and\nthe dermal papilla cellsare no longer touching.At this point, the stem\ncells become quiescent.And there are enough progenitor\ncells in the hair shaftto give you formation\nof the hair.And then the stem cells remain\nquiescent until the next haircycle starts and they get in\ncontact with the dermal papillaagain and start making new hair.This is a really\nbeautiful story that'sshown us quite clearly\nhow the niche cells cancontrol these stem cells.All right.So let's spend the last minutes\ntalking about therapeutics.Here's the dream.You know, the dream is\nthat you have a stem cellpopulation for every\norgan in the body,including things\nlike limbs, suchthat if your limb gets\nsevered or your heartbecomes really diseased or\nyour spinal cord is injuredand you can't walk anymore,\nthat you can just injectinto a patient the correct\nstem cells and everythinggets repaired.That's the dream.And that's really the\nholy grail of whatthousands and thousands of\ninvestigators are going after.And it's given precedence by\nbone marrow transplants, whichreally are very successful.Turns out that\nit's kind of tough.It's tough because these adult\nstem cells are really rare.The hematopoietic stem cells\nare special because they're", "start":

the quest has been to\nfind some kind of substitutefor adult stem cells.And those substitutes\ncome in two flavors.One are embryonic stem\ncells, abbreviated, ESCs.Embryonic stem\ncells are cells thatgrow from the inner cell mass\nof an early mammalian embryo.And you can grow\nfrom them groupsof cells that will keep\ngrowing in the laboratoryfor a long time and\nhave variable potency.So the embryonic stem\ncells are derivedfrom the inner cell mass of\nan early mammalian embryo--human in the case of human.And you grow out\nso-called ESC lines,", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.681}, {"text":

on\nyour next handout,the idea is that you take\nthis inner cell mass,you plate the cells\nas single cells,they grow and grow and grow.And if you treat them\nwith various inducers,you can get them to become\nheart or neuron progenitors,inject those into animals\nand make them better.There are some issues\nwith embryonic stem cells.And the problems are twofold.One is ethical in that you\nhave to harvest human embryos.You have to obtain and\nharvest human embryosto get these human\nstem cell lines.And currently, you're\nreally not allowedto do much human embryo work\nto obtain human stem cells.But the second,\neven if you were,is that these cells\nare non-autologous.They do not match the person\ninto which you're putting them.", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.518}, {"text": "They do not match the immune\nsystem of the recipient.And so they'll be rejected.And it's the same as\nan organ transplant.You have lots of\nproblems of rejection.So the latest thing that is\nvery exciting and wonderfuland potentially might be very\nuseful, is the use of thingscalled IPS cells, in which\nyou convert adult cellsinto stem cells.And you do so, as I'll tell you,\nby adding some transcriptionfactors to them.The advantage of these is\nthat they are self cells.You could do them from yourself.The disadvantage is that\nthey're really not proven.And there is still, I will\njust say, lots of problems.But there are a lot\nof people, includingsome of the top\ninvestigators in the world,working on these IPS cells.So look at your last handout.We will remove our interesting\ncalendar reminders there.Adult differentiated\ncells, which are unipotent,can be treated with three or\nfour transcription factors.And finding these transcription\nfactors is the key.And once you express these\ntranscription factorsin these adult cells, like\nmagic, they become stem cells.It really was like magic.You can test the potency\nof these stem cellsin the same way we discussed.And Professor Yamanaka in\nJapan and Professor Jaenischhere have shown that these are\nreally very powerful cells.And those are the\npromise of the future.And we'll stop there\nand meet on Friday.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.295}]
