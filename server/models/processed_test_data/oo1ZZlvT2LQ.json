[{"text": " PROFESSOR: Hi. Well, this is exponential day, the day for the function that only calculus could create, y is e to the x. And it couldn't have come from algebra because, however we approach e to the x, there's some limiting step. Something goes to 0. Something goes to infinity. I've got different ways to reach e to the x, but all of them involve that limiting process, which we haven't discussed in full. Let me come back at a later time to the whole theory, discussion of limits and just go forward here with this highly important function. And I'd like to start with its most important property, which is-- so it has this remarkable property that its slope is equal to itself. That's what is special about e to the x. The slope is equal to the function. Now, I have to admit that if we had a function like that, y equals e to the x, then 2e to the x, x would work just as well, or 10e to the x. Those would-- the factor 2 or the factor 10 would be in y and it would", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.207}, {"text": " also be in the slope and it would cancel and-- this is a differential equation, our first differential equation. A differential equation is an equation that involves, as this one does, the function and the slope. It connects them. And that's the fantastic description of nature, is by differential equations. So it's great to see this one early and it's the most important one. When you get this one, you've got a whole lot of others solved. OK. But I needed to give it a starting point so that the solution would be e to the x and not 10e to the x. So where should I start it? Well if I want it to be an e to the x, then when x is 0, e to the 0 power, some number to the 0 power, is always 1. So let me start this y equals 1 at x equals 0. Differential equations, you have to tell where they begin. So that's our starting point. And do you see what this means? This means that it starts at 1. And what's it's slope at the starting point? The slope is also 1. So it's climbing. As it climbs-- so y gets larger because it's got a positive slope. As y gets larger, the slope gets larger. So it climbs faster. And then it's gone higher, y is bigger, the slope is equal, so the slope is also bigger, so it climbs even faster. It just takes off.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.424}, {"text": " It climbs much faster than x to the 100th power. You might think x to the 100th, that's climbing pretty well. 2 to the 100th, 10 to the 100th, but now way. It doesn't come close to keeping up with y equals e to the x. OK. I've got several things to do. And one more thing I have to do, this is a key property, but there's another key property that is true for any 2 to the x, 3 to the x, e to the x. And that key property is also to show-- I have to show this, that my function, e to the x, times e to the possibly a different x is equal to-- do you know what we want here? This has got to come out of the construction, out of this property. It's got to come-- but we want this to deserve, to be called some number to the x power. If we take some number x times multiplied by that same number capital x times, then we've got that number how many times? x plus capital x. So that's a key property to be proved. So what will I do? Let me summarize in advance, outline in advance. I'm going to construct this function from its property. Then I'm going check that it's got this property, that important equality there. Then, of course, I'll graph it. I'll figure out what e is, and I'll say something about cases", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " where this comes up. I could even say something right away about, where does this happen that growth is equal or proportional to the function itself? It happens with interest, with money in a bank. When you get interest, the interest is proportional, of course, the amount there. And if they add that interest in, if you don't take it out and spend it but you compound it, put it in there, then you have more money. When they compute the interest again, it's computed on that larger amount and is more interest than the first time. And so it goes. So money in the bank is a case of exponential growth. A hedge fund grows faster than our bank account does, but all following e to the x. If you just hang on long enough, you're way up there. OK. So here's my job. Follow this rule and start at y equals 1. So can I just do it this way? Here is my function, y of x, that I want to construct. I want to build that function. And I know that it starts at 1. But it's going to have some more things. Now, this has to equal dy dx. These have to be the same. That's my rule. So dy dx is going to start with a 1. But now I can't stop because if the derivative is a 1, I", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " better put-- I have to put an x up here so that its derivative will be 1, right? Its slope will be 1. That's that steadily climbing x whose slope is 1. But now, these are supposed to be equal again. So I have to put this x also here. But now, I've got to add something more on the top so that the slope will be 1 plus x. The slope of the x was 1. What do I need here to give the slope to be x? Remember, x squared had the slope 2x, so I need half of x squared so that I'll have 1x. So I need a half of x squared. Good. The slope of that is this. But I'm also trying to get the 2 to be equal. So I better-- I have no choice. I have to put in the 1/2 x squared there. You see, I'm never going to catch up. Or only if I go forever. That's the point. I'll have to go forever. And what will the next one be? Oh yeah. If you see the next one, then we can see the pattern. Now what am I doing? This one has to have this slope. I'm fixing the top line now. If I'm aiming for a slope of x squared, then I need some number of x cubes. So how many x cubes do I need? Well, I need to know, what's the slope of x cube? The rule for powers of x, x to the n, is n times one smaller power. The slope of x cube is 3 times x squared.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " So I had better divide by that 3 so that the 3 cancels the 3. Now the slope of that, the 3x squared, the threes would cancel and I would get x squared. But I'm looking for 1/2 x squared. I need also a 2. Do you see that it's 1/6 of x cube that's going to do the job. 1/6 of x cubed because the slope-- the 3 cancels the 3 and I wanted to end up with a 2. And now, do you know what's coming? These are supposed to be equal. I have to have this 1/6 x cubed down here too. And I never get to stop. We have to see, OK, what is a typical-- after I've done this, say, n times, I'd like to have some idea of what is it when I get up to x to some nth power, then it's multiplied by some fraction and I'm looking to see, what is that fraction? What is that fraction? And then, of course, they'll all show up down there again. Well, if you see this pattern, this was 3 times 2-- you could say 3 times 2 times 1. This one was 2 times 1. This one was just 1. It's n factorial. n factorial is what I need. I need n times n minus 1. I need all these numbers all the way and I'll throw in the 1 at the end.

This is called n factorial, x to the nth over n factorial, because when I take the slope of x to the nth, an n will come down. Cancel that n. x, I'll have one lower power. You see, when I take the slope of this, I'll have the n will cancel the n. So I'll still have these other guys down below. And I'll have x to the n minus 1. And that will be x to the n minus 1 over n minus 1 factorial. That will be the previous one. But now I have to add in the x to the nth over n factorial because y and dy to the x have to be the same, so I have to keep going. OK. So you might say, well, you're going to blow up. Not personally, the series. But what saves you? What saves you is the fact that these n factorials, those fractions, that n factorial gets to be really large really fast, faster than this x to nth could grow. So altogether, these terms, x to the nth over n factorial, they get extremely, extremely small. And then this series of things, it comes to a limit. It doesn't keep going, getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger as I had more terms, because what I'm adding is so small, so small. And that's the point where we have to discuss limits later. OK.

And let me write again what it is. 1 plus x plus 1/2 x squared plus 1/6 x cubed and so on.

Notice the way I'm doing is like I'm keeping all the things that have two x's together. And then I would keep all the things that have three x's together, and so on. Now what is it that I'm hoping? I'm hoping that this is the same as the series for x plus capital x, OK? What's that? That's my exponential series. And every time, I have to put in x plus capital x. In other words, of course, it starts with 1. Then it has the x plus capital x. And then it has the 1/2 of x plus capital x squared. And it keeps going. And I just wanted you to say, yes. I guess I hope you say yes when I ask, is this big multiplication the same as this one? Well, I think it is. Let's just start to check, anyway. The ones are good.

Little x times big x, there'd be two of those. But then the 1/2 factor leaves me with 1, and that's what I want. And then, finally, this guy by himself squared is the 1/2 capital x squared that I also want. So far, so good. Do you want to see the cubed terms? Well, I'd rather you did it, but I should at least show that I'm willing to try. So what do I mean by the cubed terms? I mean that here, I want to get-- the next one should be 1/6 of x plus x cubed. And from the multiplication, I get some separate pieces. I get 1 times-- when I do that multiplication, I get 1/6 x cubed. And then I maybe get some 1/2 x squared times x.

So those are the four pieces that come, third degree, when I do the big multiplication. And they have to match the third degree term in the last line. And they do match. Do you remember the right words to say now? Binomial theorem. The binomial theorem tells you how to take the nth power all a sum like x plus capital x to the nth power. It tells you all the many pieces you get. And those many pieces are exactly the pieces that we get directly by multiplying that line by that line. So the binomial theorem, at long last, pays off and confirms our great property here. So this is a big deal. OK. So let me now come back here, having checked that. I wanted to say something about this series, 1 plus x plus 1/2 x squared, where the typical term is x to the nth over n factorial.

Can you see this 1 plus x plus x squared plus x cubed plus x to the n? That, I think it's called the geometric series. Powers of x. Now, it's simpler because it doesn't have these fractions. But it's riskier because those fractions were making the exponential series succeed. Whereas here, with the geometric series, well, look what happens when x is 1. When x is 1, we have 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 forever. All ones. It blows up. And when x is bigger than 1, that series blows up even faster. So in this series, the geometric series, this most important one, does succeed but only when x is below 1. x equal 1 is the cutoff and it fails after that. There is no cutoff for the exponential series because of", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " dividing by these bigger and bigger numbers. This works for all x.

Put in set x equal 1 and you learn that e to the first power, which is e, is-- can I just put it in? 1 plus x is 1 plus 1/2 of 1 squared plus 1/6 of 1 cubed. What's the next term in this? So these are numbers now, and I'm getting a number. I'm getting this incredible number e, named after Euler. Euler was a fantastic mathematician.

These later terms are dropping too fast. And actually, the number turns out to be-- so it's 2 point something. 2 point-- let's see, a little more than 2 2/3, so it's around 2.7.

Well now, let me just take capital x to be minus little x. So I get e to the x times e to the minus x. What is that? What does that equal if I multiply e to the x times e to the minus x? As usual, I'm supposed to add these. I get 0, so I get e to the 0, which is 1. In other words, e to the minus x is 1 over e to the x, which we fully expected.
