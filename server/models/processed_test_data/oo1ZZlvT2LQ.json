[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Hi.Well, this is exponential day,\nthe day for the function thatonly calculus could create,\ny is e to the x.And it couldn't have come from\nalgebra because, however weapproach e to the x, there's\nsome limiting step.Something goes to 0.Something goes to infinity.I've got different ways to reach\ne to the x, but all ofthem involve that limiting\nprocess, which we haven'tdiscussed in full.Let me come back at a later\ntime to the whole theory,discussion of limits and just\ngo forward here with thishighly important function.And I'd like to start with\nits most importantproperty, which is--so it has this remarkable\nproperty that its slope isequal to itself.That's what is special\nabout e to the x.The slope is equal\nto the function.Now, I have to admit that if we\nhad a function like that, yequals e to the x, then 2e to\nthe x, x would work just aswell, or 10e to the x.Those would--the factor 2 or the factor 10\nwould be in y and it would", "start": 0.0,

one.When you get this one,\nyou've got a wholelot of others solved.OK.But I needed to give it a\nstarting point so that thesolution would be e to the\nx and not 10e to the x.So where should I start it?Well if I want it to be an e to\nthe x, then when x is 0, eto the 0 power, some number to\nthe 0 power, is always 1.So let me start this y equals\n1 at x equals 0.Differential equations, you have\nto tell where they begin.So that's our starting point.And do you see what\nthis means?This means that it\nstarts at 1.And what's it's slope at\nthe starting point?The slope is also 1.So it's climbing.As it climbs--so y gets larger because it's\ngot a positive slope.As y gets larger, the\nslope gets larger.So it climbs faster.And then it's gone higher, y is\nbigger, the slope is equal,so the slope is also bigger,\nso it climbs even faster.It just takes off.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.424}, {"text": "It climbs much faster than\nx to the 100th power.You might think x to\nthe 100th,

this is a key property,but there's another key property\nthat is true for any2 to the x, 3 to the\nx, e to the x.And that key property\nis also to show--I have to show this, that my\nfunction, e to the x, times eto the possibly a different\nx is equal to--do you know what we want here?This has got to come out of theconstruction, out of this property.It's got to come--but we want this to deserve,\nto be called some number tothe x power.If we take some number x times\nmultiplied by that same numbercapital x times, then\nwe've got thatnumber how many times?x plus capital x.So that's a key property\nto be proved.So what will I do?Let me summarize in advance,\noutline in advance.I'm going to construct this\nfunction from its property.Then I'm going check that it's\ngot this property,

interest\nagain, it's computed on thatlarger amount and is more\ninterest than the first time.And so it goes.So money in the bank is a case\nof exponential growth.A hedge fund grows faster than\nour

my function, y of x,\nthat I want to construct.I want to build that function.And I know that it\nstarts at 1.But it's going to have\nsome more things.Now, this has to equal dy dx.These have to be the

I've got to add\nsomething more on the top sothat the slope will\nbe 1 plus x.The slope of the x was 1.What do I need here to give\nthe slope to be x?Remember, x squared had the\nslope 2x, so I need half of xsquared so that I'll have 1x.So I need a half of x squared.Good.The slope of that is this.But I'm also trying to get\nthe 2 to be equal.So I better--I have no choice.I have to put in the
