[{"text": " [MUSIC PLAYING] CURT NEWTON: We are super excited that we've got over two million subscribers now to the OCW YouTube channel. CHERYL SIEGEL: It's two million. It's like the biggest educational thing on YouTube. LINDSEY WEERAMUNI: It's awesome. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous SHIBA NEMAT-NASSAR: You know, I have a hard time understanding how big two million is. ALICIA FRANKE: Two million people cared about watching. BRETT PACI: I'm really glad that that many people have found us. I think it could be more. ELIZABETH DERIENZO: I also wonder, why did it take so long? Everything we have is so amazing and so useful for people. BRETT PACI: I'm not satisfied. You know what my favorite million subscribers is? The next million subscribers. It's a Tom Brady thing. CURT NEWTON: You've come from all over the world, watching OCW videos over 187 million times for over one billion minutes. And it's all thanks to the generosity of the MIT faculty. I think it's really a testament to how hungry the whole world is for the kind of openly shared knowledge that MIT OpenCourseWave is providing. Here's some of the things that we've enjoyed working on. ELIZABETH DERIENZO: So I've worked on Classical Mechanics, Vibrations and Waves. LINDSEY WEERAMUNI: Girls Who Build These are some pretty kickass girls in STEM, and they're building wearables. SHIBA NEMAT-NASSAR: I recently published a music course that was all about The Beatles. ELIZABETH DERIENZO: Single Variable Calculus. Multi Variable Calculus. Differential Equations. PETER CHIPMAN: Con Langs. It's about constructed languages, like Elvish and Esperanto and Dothraki.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " ELIZABETH DERIENZO: Quantum Mechanics I. Quantum Mechanics II. Quantum Mechanics III. CHERYL SIEGEL: Speak Italian With Your Mouth Full. They spent half the time in the classroom learning Italian and then the second half in the kitchen cooking and using the language that they learned. I did not get to eat the food. SHARON LIN: Global Studies and language courses. I think, you know, to be able to have a global view of the world can make people understand the world better. ELIZABETH DERIENZO: Atomic and Optical Physics I. Atomic and Optical Physics II. Oh yeah. Experimental Physics which is junior lab I and II. BRETT PACI: A course called Creating Video Games. It was really cool. The students created games of their own for their final projects, and we actually have those playable on our website. CURT NEWTON: Be sure to check out our interviews, also, with MIT faculty talking about how they teach and their passion for teaching. And be sure to check out all the other course materials from thousands of MIT courses on the OCW website. Keep exploring, discovering new topics, and sharing with your friends. We're really glad you've joined us on this journey, and stick with us. We are nowhere near done. BOTH: Thank you. BOTH: Thank you. BRETT PACI: Thank you.
