comment about mechanical\nengineering courses.The first, and you may have\nheard this already in classes,you'll be taking\nsubject 2001 if you'reCourse 2 majors through\n2009, and if you're2-A, most of the odd ones.But the subjects\n2001 through 2005are really basically engineering\nscience subjects that are allfoundational to\nmechanical engineering,and they all have a common\nor property through them.And that is that we make\nobservations of the world,and we try to understand them.We pose problems.Why-- 400 years ago, is\nthe sun in the centerof the solar system or not?And we try to produce models\nthat explain the problem.So here's the problem,\nthe question of the day.We try to produce\nmodels to describe it,and we make observations,\nmeasurements, to seeif our models are correct.And if we feed that information\nback into the models,we try out the models, we test\nit against more observations,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and you go round and round.And this is kind of\nthe fundamental--this is the way all of these\nbasic first five subjects use,basically, this\nmethod of inquiry.So in 2003, the way\nthis system works,my kind of mental conception\nof this modeling process,is three things.And this applies to you.You have a homework problem.How do you attack\na homework problem?You're going to need\nto describe the motion.You're going to need to choose\nthe physical laws-- pick,I'll call it\nbecause it's short--the physical law that\nyou want to applylike f equals ma,\nconservation of energy,conservation of momentum.You got to know which\nphysical laws to apply.And then finally, third you\nneed to apply the correct math.And that's really--\nmost dynamic problemscan be broken down this way.That's the way I like to\nconceptually break them down.You might have another\nmodel, but this isthe way I'm going to teach it.Can you describe the motion,\npick the correct physical lawsto apply to the problem, and\nable to do the correct math,solving the equation\nof motion, for example.And all this is what\nfits in our models box.And we test it against\nobservations and measurementsand improve those\nthings over time.So I'm going to give you--\nhow many of you like history?I find history and\nhistory technologykind of fun and interesting.So I'm going to throw\na little bit of historyinto giving you a\nlittle quick courseoutline of what we're going to\ndo in this subject this term.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.179}, {"text": "Because the history\ndynamics and whatwe're going to do in the course\nactually track one

Copernicus.PROFESSOR: Good.Copernicus.So Copernicus was\nPolish, and the storystarts long before then, but\nin about 1,500 Copernicussaid what?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: The sun's the center?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Or the\nEarth is the center?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Which did say?Yes, so Ptolemy, back\naround 130 AD said,well the Earth's the\ncenter of the solar system.Copernicus came\nalong and said, nopeI think that, in fact, the sun's\nthe center of the solar system.And it for the next 100 years--\nmore than 100 years, couplehundred years-- there was\na really raging controversyabout that.So Copernicus, Brahe\nKepler-- so I'mputting them in rough\nchronological order here.Now, I'm going to\nrun out of board.Oh well.Galileo, Descartes-- I'm

you,I haven't used this classroom\nbefore so I gotta learn howto play this game.I need to be able to\nreach this for a minute.So Brahe, he was\nalong about 1,600.Brahe was the\nmathematician that wrote--the imperial mathematician\nto the emperor in Prague.And he did 20 years\nof observations.And he was out to prove\nthat the Earth wasthe center of the solar system.And then Kepler actually worked\nwith him as a mathematician,and then took over as the\nimperial mathematician.And he took Brahe's data--\n20 years of astronomical datawithout the use\nof the telescope--and used it come up with the\nthree laws of planetary motion.And so his first and second\nlaws were put out about 1609.And one of the laws\nis, like, equal areaswept out in equal time.Have you hear that one?That actually turns out to be\na statement of conservationof angular momentum, which\nwe'll talk quite a bitabout the course.Then came Galileo, and I'm not\nputting their birth and deathdates here.I'm kind of putting\nin a period of timein which kind of important\nthings happened around him.So 401 years ago a really\nimportant thing happened.Galileo, in 1609, turned\nthe telescope on Jupiter,", "start":

Euclid a lot.But then he came up with a\nCartesian coordinate system,xyz, and the beginnings\nof analytic geometry,which is essentially algebra,\ncoordinates, and geometry allput together.And we are going to make\ngreat use of analytic geometryin this course.Then came Newton, kind of in\nhis actual lifespan, 1643.It's kind of interesting\nthat he spans these people.And in about 1666 is when he\nfirst-- the first statementof the three laws of motion.Then Euler, and he's 1707 to\n1783, and that's his lifespan.Euler came up-- Newton never\ntalked about angular momentum.He mostly talked\nabout particles.Euler put Newton's three\nlaws into mathematics.Euler taught us about\nangular momentum,and torque being dh\ndt in most cases.He's the most prolific\nmathematician all

going to\nstart today is with kinematics.And very soon\nthereafter, we're goingto review Newton, the\nthree laws, and whatwe call the direct method for\nfinding equations of motion.Conservation of\nmomentum, fact thatforce-- some of the\nforces on an objectequals mass times acceleration,\nor it's a time derivativeof its linear momentum.And we use that to derive\nequations of motion.So we're going to go kinematics\ninto doing the direct methodto getting equations of motion.And we go from there\ninto angular momentum,and what Euler gave us--\nthe same thing, torque.We're going to do quite a\nlot with angular momentum.Because I know you know\na lot about f equals maand you've done lots of\nproblems 801 applying that.You've done some problems\non rigid body rotations.But I think there's\na lot more youneed to understand\nabout this, and we'llspend quite a bit of time on it.And then near the\nlast third the coursewe shift, because Lagrange said\nthat if you just write

of this\nmodeling describing the motion,picking physical laws,\napplying the math.And that'll get us\nlaunched in the course.And we'll do it using Newton\nand the direct method.", "start": 720.0,

classes.OK, it's a system which\nhas a spring, a mass,it exhibits something\ncalled a natural frequency.But let's see what it takes\nto just initially beginto follow this modeling\nmethod to arriveat an equation of\nmotion for this problem.So what do I mean by when\nI say, describe the motion?Really what that\nboils down to if youhave to assign a\ncoordinate systemso that you can actually say\nwhere the object's moving.And I'm going to pick one here.So here's-- coordinate system\ngoing to be really importantin this course.And I'll give us an xyz\nCartesian coordinate system.And I'm going to try to adopt\nthe habit, for the most part,during the course that\nthis o marks this origin,but it also names the frame.So we're going to\ntalk about thingsin that are reference frames.And most important\none that we need", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.129}, {"text": "to know about in the course is\nan inertial reference frame,and when you can use\nit, and when a systemis inertial and is not.So I'm gonna say that\nthis is inertial.It's fixed to the Earth.It's not moving.And we're going to use this\ncoordinate x to describethe motion of this mass.And the motion is going to be--\nthis x is from the zero springforce position.It's actually quite\nimportant that youpick-- that you\nhave to say what'sthe condition in the spring\nof the system when x is 0So we're going to say\nit's, when there'sno force in the\nspring means it's notstretch, that's where 0 is.So we've established\na coordinate system.Second, we need to\napply physical laws.Now, I'm going to do\nthis problem by f equalsma, Newton's second law.Sum of the external\nforces is equal to masstimes the acceleration.So that's the law\nI'm going to apply.Sum of the external\nforces, it's a vectorbut we're just doing the x\ncomponent only so we don't haveto carry along vector notation,\nis equal to, in this case,mass times acceleration.So that's the law\nwe're going to apply.And then finally the math to\nsolve the equation of motionthat we find, that'll\nbe the third piece.But part of applying\nthe physics, in orderto do this now, we need\nwhat I call an FBD.What do you suppose that is?AUDIENCE: Free body diagrams.PROFESSOR: Free body diagrams.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.213}, {"text": "You've used these\nmany times before,so we're going to do those.And free body diagrams--And I'm going to\nteach you, at leastthe way I go about doing\nfree body diagrams,as things get more\nand more complicated,you're going to have to be\nmore sophisticated in the waythat you do these things.So I just have some\nsimple little rulesto do free body diagrams that\nkeep you from getting hung upon sign conventions.I think the thing people\nmake most mistakes about isthey get confused about signs.So I'll try to show\nyou how I do it.So first you draw forces\nthat you know, basicallyin the direction\nin which they act.Seems obvious.So when you know\nthe direction-- sothis is a really\ntrivial problem,but the method here\nis very specific.So what's an example?Well, gravity.So we'll start our\nfree body diagram.Gravity acts at\nthe center of mass.It's downward.This is what I mean by the\ndirection in which it acts.And it has magnitude, mg.OK.Now the other forces\naren't so obvious.The force that's put on by\nthe stiffness and this damperin the spring, which\nway do you draw them?What's the sign?What's the sign convention?So the convention, the way I\ngo about doing these things,is I assume positive values for\nthe deflections and velocities.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So in this case, x and x dot.You just require that the\ndeflections that you're goingto work with are positive.And then from the\npositive deflection,you say which way is\nthe resulting force?So if the deflection\nin this is downwards,which direction is the force\nthat the spring appliesto the mass?Up, right?What about if the\nvelocity is downwards,which direction is the force\nis the damper puts on the mass?Also up, right?OK.So this allows-- this gives us--\nso here's f spring and here'sthe f damper.And other any other\nforces on this mass?So spring force, damper force,\nand the gravitational force.And so third, you deduce\nthe signs basicallyfrom the direction\nof the arrows.First we need what's called\nyour constitutive relationship.So the spring force,\nfs, well you'vemade x positive so\nit keeps things nice,the spring constant's a\npositive number, so fs is kx.Fd is bx dot.And now we write the\nstatement that the sumof forces in the x direction.We look at up here, we\nsay well that's goingto fs plus fd minus mg.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So that's-- whoops, I wrote\nit the wrong way around.Minus, minus, plus.Because I'm plus\ndownwards, right?Well, spring minus fs\nis minus kx minus bx dotplus mg equals mx double dot.And I rearranged this\nto put all the motionvariables on one side.mx double dot plus bx\ndot plus kx equals mg.So there's my equation of\nmotion, but with a methodfor doing the free\nbody diagrams, whichwill work with multiple bodies.So you have two bodies with\nsprings in between them.This is when the\nconfusion really comes up.Two bodies with a spring\ntrapped between them.What's the sign convention?You do the same thing.Both bodies exhibit\npositive motions,the force that results is\nproportional to the difference,and you work it out.And you'll get the signs right.OK, so here's our\nequation of motion arrivedat by doing the direct method.And if we went on to the\nthird step, which we're notgoing to do today, and\nthat is apply the math,it might because I want you now\nto describe the motion for me,solve for the motion.That means solving the\ndifferential equation.And that's what we did last\nmay in Haynes Miller's class.We'll come back\nto this later on.But for today's purposes,\nwe don't need to go there.Got something else\nmuch more importantto get to about kinematics.But I want to show\nyou one thing,and that is just a little\ntiny introductory tasteto this point.So I've derived the\nequation of motion of thisby Newton's laws.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "But I'm going to\nignore Newton nowand saw I'm going to\ndrive equation of motionby another way.And it's an energy\ntechnique, and that is-- welllet's talk about the total\nenergy of the system.It's going to be the\nsum of a kinetic energyand a potential energy.And we'll find that even\nwith Lagrange, there'sa problem with forces\non systems thatare what we call\nnon-conservative,things that either take\nenergy out of, or put energyinto the system.And the dashpot does that.Dashpot generates heat and\ntakes energy out of the system.So I'm going to have to\nignore it for the moment.So the sum of the kinetic\nand the potential energiesin this problem is\na 1/2 kx squaredfor the potential of the spring,\nplus a 1/2 mx dot squaredfor the kinetic energy of\nthe mass, and minus mgxfor the potential energy that\nis due to the object movingin the gravitational field.And that's the total\nenergy of the system.Now my problem, I've\nallowed no forces.There's no excitation on here.This is just free\nvibration only.That's

over there.It's got to be constant, right?All right, well, so\nthis must be constant.Therefore, the time derivative\nof my system, it better be 0.The energy is constant.Take it's time

damping term.And that you still have\nto consider it as a force,we'll find out.Even was Lagrange you have to go\nback and consider the work doneby external forces.OK.So you've just kind of\nseen the
