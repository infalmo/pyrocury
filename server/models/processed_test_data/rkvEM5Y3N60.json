self-study courseon digital signal processing.The fact that you're\ninterested in taking the coursesuggests that you're probably\naware of the important rolethat digital techniques\nhave been playing in signalprocessing, in general.And in fact, the impact\nof digital technologyhas been rather dramatic.And the indications\nare that it willbe even more so in the future.One of the primary\nadvantages to digital asopposed to analog signal\nprocessing techniquesis the tremendous flexibility\nthat digital techniquesand digital signal\nprocessing offers.And because of this flexibility,\ndigital signal processingtechniques have\nfound applicationin a rather large or\nwide variety of areas.Speech processing, for\nexample, has representedone of the major\nareas of applicationof digital signal processing\nfor, at least, the past decade.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.151}, {"text": "Both analysis of speech\nand synthesis of speechrely very heavily\non the notions of,for example, digital\nfiltering, other notions,such as the fast Fourier\ntransform algorithm,and a variety of the\nother digital signalprocessing techniques\nand algorithms.More generally, in\ncommunication systems,digital signal processing\nis being used for coding,for multiplexing\nand, in fact, thereis a considerable amount of work\nbeing done at present directedtoward, basically, replacing\nall of the present filteringin communications\nand telephone systemsby digital filters\ninstead of analog filters.And I think that it's\nlikely that, in the nottoo distant future,\nwe'll see mostof the filtering in\ncommunication systems beingdone digitally.Seismic data\nprocessing representsanother very important\narea in whichthe flexibility of\ndigital signal processingis very heavily exploited.In fact, seismic and\nspeech processinghave probably been the\ntwo major catalystsfor most of the\nimportant developmentsin digital signal processing.In audio recording\nand processing,digital signal processing\nprovides an opportunityfor some very sophisticated\nprocessing and enhancement.And in fact, fairly recently,\nProfessor Thomas Stockhamat the University\nof Utah has beenapplying some sophisticated\ndigital signalprocessing techniques to the\nrestoration of old Carusorecordings.The problem, in that case,\nis that the recordings thatwere originally made\nin the days of Caruso", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "involved a recording horn,\nas I've illustrated here.The singer, of course, singing\ninto the recording horn.And the output of the\nrecording horn beingstored on a recording disk.The problem in that\nparticular applicationis the fact that the frequency\nresponse of the recording hornis not flat.And what this tended to do is\ngive the resulting recordinga, sort of, megaphone\ntype of distortion.And one of the objectives\nin enhancing or restoringsome of these old\nCaruso recordingsis to compensate, in a\nsense, for the frequencydistortion introduced\nby the recording horn.What Professor\nStockham has done,basically, is to use digital\nsignal processing techniquesto, first of all,\nestimate the frequencyresponse of the recording horn.And second, to compensate\nfor that frequency response.And all of the work\nthat he carried outwas done digitally, primarily,\nas I indicated previously,primarily to capitalize\non the flexibilitythat digital signal\nprocessing offers.And some of the results that he\nobtained are rather dramatic.And let me just illustrate\nin a very short passage whatsome of this has sounded like.What I borrowed from\nProfessor Stockhamis a recording of\nthe restorationthat he generated on\na digital computer.And this particular recording\nis a two track recordingwith the original\nsegment recordedon channel 1 and the process\nsegment recorded on channel 2.And that will allow us to switch\nback and forth between these.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.251}, {"text": "The particular piece\nthat is illustrated hereis a section from the famous\naria \"Vesti La Giubba\"as sung, of course,\nby Enrico Caruso.So let me just quickly\nillustrate thisas an example of some of\nthe type of processingthat is currently being done\nusing digital signal processingtechniques.Let me begin, first\nof all, by playinga little bit of the original.And then, I'll switch to the\nresult of Professor Stockholm'senhancement.And then, switch back\nand forth a few timesto present a comparison.So we begin, first of\nall, with the original.[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, \"VESTI LA\n GIUBBA\"]And then switch to the enhanced.[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, \"VESTI LA\n GIUBBA\"]Back to the original.[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, \"VESTILA GIUBBA\"]And then, once more,\nto the enhanced.[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, \"VESTI LA\n GIUBBA\"]And I think what you\ncan observe with thatis a fairly dramatic increase in\nthe improvement in the qualityof the recording.Primarily, the megaphone type\nof quality in the originalhas been, essentially,\neliminated.Now to go even further\nin illustratingsome of the flexibility of\ndigital signal processing.One of the things\nthat we observewith this particular recording\nand this particular exampleis that, although there\nis some enhancement that'sbeen implemented, there still\nis some background noise thatis present in, both, the\noriginal and the enhanced", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.218}, {"text": "or restored.And so one of the\nthings, obviously,that we would like to do is\nremove this background noise.In fact, using some rather\nsophisticated signal processingtechniques, Professor Stockham,\ntogether with Neil J. Miller,have not only removed\nthe background noisebut, with the same\nprocessing, removed alsothe orchestral accompaniment.Now this is, first of\nall, rather dramatic.Second of all, somewhat useful\nin the sense that in carryingout a complete restoration\none can imagine thenredubbing a new orchestra on\ntop of the restored recording.So let me just play a little\nbit of this to, in fact,show you that it really has\nbeen possible to not only removethe background noise\nbut also to removethe orchestral accompaniment.So first let me move forward\non the tape to the right place.And what you'll hear now\nin this case, on channel 1,is the Caruso recording restored\nas I indicated previously.And on channel 2 is the\nresult of further processing,the restored recording,\nto eliminate,both, the background noise\nand also the orchestra.So we'll begin\nwith the restored,which includes the orchestra.And then, the orchestra removed.[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, \"VESTI LAGIUBBA\"]That's with the orchestra.[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, \"VESTI LA\n GIUBBA\"]And with the orchestra and\nthe background noise removed.[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, \"VESTI LA\n GIUBBA\"]", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.492}, {"text": "And then, once more, back to\nthe orchestral [INAUDIBLE]..[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO,\"VESTI LA GIUBBA\"]Well I think that\nyou'll probablyhave to admit\nthat, in fact, it'sa rather dramatic example of\nsome sophisticated digitalsignal processing.Another area in which\ndigital signal processinghas tremendous\npotential is in the areaof digital image processing.And in that case,\nthe basic notionis to treat an image as a two\ndimensional signal digitized,of course.And one is then\nafforded the possibilityof applying digital signal\nprocessing techniquesto the two dimensional signal.For example, in a very simple\nsignal processing environment,we might be interested in low\npass filtering a digital image.For example, if the image\nhas considerable grain noise,grain noise, in fact,\ntends to be high frequency.And low pass filtering then\nwill tend to reduce or eliminatenoise of that type.Or we might be interested\nin high pass filtering.For example, if we wanted to\nenhance edges in a picture,the procedure would\nbe or one proceduremight be to apply a two\ndimensional high pass filter.More elaborately,\nwe could considersome processing, which is\ndirected at general imageenhancement.And one example that I'd like to\nshow you is some digital imageprocessing that was\ncarried out directedat simultaneously reducing\nthe dynamic range of an image", "start": 600.0, "heat": 1.0}, {"text": "and increasing the\ncontrast of the image.Generally,\nphotographically, theseare conflicting requirements.But with some\nsophisticated processing,it's possible to simultaneously\nreduce the dynamic rangeand increase the contrast.To illustrate how this\nworks with an example,the first slide that I'll show\nyou is an original image, whichis, of course, a digital image\ndisplayed on a computer scope.And one of the things that\nwe notice about that imageis that it has a rather\nhigh dynamic range.For example, the snow\noutside the boiler roomis rather bright.The inside of the\nboiler room is dark.And of course, the contrast\ninside the boiler roomis relatively low\nbecause of the factthat the illumination inside the\nboiler room is relatively low.So one type of processing\nthat we could consideris the simultaneous\nenhancement of contrast,and reduction of dynamic\nrange, and applying some twodimensional signal processing.The result is what I show\nyou on the next slidewhere, here, we've\nprocessed to bring outthe detail inside\nthe boiler room.You can notice that the dynamic\nrange, in fact, is reduced.The snow is darker than\nit was in the original.The boiler room is brighter\nthan it was in the original,suggesting reduced\ndynamic range.But also, the contrast\nis very clearly enhanced.Just as another example of\nthe same type of processing.First, let's look\nat an original wherewe observe that there's a\nbrightly illuminated area,which is where the\nradome moves is.And then, a more dimly\nilluminated area.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.431}, {"text": "The details in the\nright hand cornerwith the trees and leaves.And as a result\nof processing to,again, increase the contrast\nand reduce the dynamic range,we see in the resulting\nprocessed imagethat the detail in the\ndimly illuminated areas,in fact, is brought out\nrather dramatically.So this is one example of\nsome rather sophisticateddigital signal\nprocessing appliedto two dimensional signals.Namely, to images.And I should\nmention incidentallythat the type of processing\nthat was applied for this imageenhancement is discussed in\nconsiderable detail in chapter10 of the text.Now there are, of course, a\nlong list of other applicationsof digital signal processing.In the biomedical\narea, for example,digital signal\nprocessing techniquesare playing a very\nimportant role.In radar and sonar, those\nare two additional areasin which digital\nsignal processingis extremely important.And I'm sure that\nthere are other areasthat you're aware of that\nI, perhaps, might notbe where digital signal\nprocessing is particularlyimportant because\nof its flexibility.Specifically, in\nthis course, we won'tbe focusing on applications.Although, it's important\nto keep in mind as wego through the course\nthat the materialthat we're talking about has\nvery important applications.In the course, we'll be\nconcentrating specificallyon the fundamentals and\ntechniques of digital signalprocessing.As I've indicated\nin the study guide,", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.333}, {"text": "I will be assuming\nthat you previouslyhave had a course in linear\nsystem theory, continuous timelinear system theory, including\nFourier and Laplace transforms.But I will not be assuming\nany specific backgroundin discrete time signals\nand systems in Z-transforms,et cetera.In fact, in the next\nlecture, lecture two,we will begin from\nthe beginning.Namely, we will begin with a\ndefinition of discrete timesignals and systems.And if you feel a little\nrusty on basic linear systemtheory for continuous\ntime systems,it might be well\nbefore then to dojust a little bit of reviewing.And I suggest some possible\nbooks in the study guide.I would also suggest, before\nbeginning the next lecture,that you read the\nintroduction to the text.And perhaps, also browse through\nthe text and the study guideto get a general impression\nof the scope of the course,and some of the\nobjectives of the course.As I indicated,\nnext time, we willbegin with the definition\nof discrete time signalsand
