a\nscientific kind for somethingas complex as human behavior as\nopposed to things that youmeasure out in space or test\ntubes or under microscopes.People are complex\norganisms, right?And to do research on them, to\nunderstand human nature, howthe mind works, how the\nbrain supports it, isa challenging story.So the usual thing\nis an experiment.You have a group of\nparticipants.And we'll talk about that.But in the reading for today,\nand I know it's the first timewe've done this so you may not\nhave read it, but if you have,that'd be great, is a kind of\nanother thread of the kind ofway that people are studied,\nwhich is dramatic individualstories, case studies, single\nstories that are illustrativeof something that we think\nare broader principles.And a lot of our biggest\ndiscoveries-- and we'll cometo that later in the course--\nhave been made on very unusualsingle individuals who turn out\nto have a lesson that'spretty broad, for example,\nfor the organizationof the human brain.So in the Oliver Sacks book,\nthere's a story about Donald.And what did Donald do that\ngot him in big trouble?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Yeah, he murdered\nhis girlfriendwhile he was on PCP.He's in a psychiatric\nhospital.They try hypnosis to help\nhim remember it.He says he doesn't\nremember it.Many of you may know that an\nastounding number of criminalsunder interrogation tell you\nthey don't remember anythingabout the episode involved.So people are suspicious, at\nfirst, for many reasons.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.558}, {"text": "Because the easiest thing\nto say is I don'tremember what happened.And then you can't catch\nyourself in a lie or anycomplexity, right?Because you don't remember\nwhat happened.And sometimes you\ndon't remember.And sometimes you do.But in this case, they\ntried hypnosis.That doesn't help.He's in there for four years.And he knows conceptually that\nhe murdered his girlfriend.And he says, I'm not\nfit for society.He knows it's a terrible\nthing he did.But it's kind of like an\nintellectual knowledge, right?It's not a feeling.It's not a memory.And then he goes biking and\nsomething happens, which is hegets hit by a car.And so there's what appears to\nbe a drug-induced amnesia ofthe original murderous\nepisode.He gets hit by a car.He has a severe head injury.He's in a coma for two weeks.He has left-sided weakness as\nhe comes out of it, whichmeans the biggest injury was\nin the right side of hisbrain, weakness and numbness.And he has frontal\nlobe contusions.He has injury and bleeding\naround the frontal lobes ofthe cortex that sits in the\nfront of the brain.But now a remarkable\nthing happens.It's as if two insults, two\nwrongs, made a right, thefirst wrong being the\nPCP, the secondwrong being the accident.And now what happens?He remembers in vivid, in florid\ndetail the horror thathe actually committed\nthis murder.It's as if two insults to the\nbrain, one drug-induced, one afocal injury, repressed the\nmemory and then unrepressedthe memory.And one of the first things they\nhave to do is discoverwhether he really has his memory\nor he just thinks hehas his memory.And how do they figure out to\ntheir satisfaction whetherit's a really recovered memory\nor a fabrication of his mind?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Right.It's really important.He remembers details of the\nmurder that are not publiclyavailable, that were not\nin the information thatwas given to him.That's a really huge issue\nin these kinds of memory.So this is a really recovered\nmemory, not an inadvertentlyfabricated memory.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.386}, {"text": "And they discover he has deep\nseizure activity in his limbicstructures, the parts of his\nbrain that are involved inemotion, are having seizures.In epilepsy, neurons are firing\nfor no good reason.And that's part of\nhis disorder.They give him medications\nto help with that.But here's the question\nfor you from amoment to think about.And it's now such a common\nquestion because our societyis moving that way that\nit's on many TV shows.I see it like every couple of\nweeks there's a Law & Orderepisode that has something like\nthis, which is the moreyou know about the biology that\nunderlies really criminalterrible behavior, should\nthat be a cause forunderstanding it or not?So in this case, he\ntook the drugs.He killed the person.You think he's pretty\nresponsible.But how about somebody who kills\nsomebody and it turnsout, and there's such a case, a\nman with no history, a grownman with no history of criminal\nactivity of any kind,shoved his wife out of a high\nwindow to her death in thecourse of a standard argument.Then they discover that he has\na big tumor growing in thebasal part of his\nfrontal cortex.Now is the man responsible\nfor what he did?It's a really interesting\nquestion.And the more we understand about\nthe neuroscience of ourbrains, what makes us do things,\nwhat lets us controlimpulses, what makes\nus murderous--There's a guy, Kent Kiehl, the\nUniversity of Mexico, he'sdriving around in a big van\nwith an MRI scanner.And he goes from penitentiary\nto penitentiary.And he images the brains\nof serial murderers, ofpsychopathic murderers.And he's getting things that\nare pretty systematicallydifferent about their brains.And the question is, what\ndoes that mean?Does that mean those people\nwere prone to do it forreasons of their early\nenvironment or genes or someincident that happened?If that's the case, do you\nforgive them differently?Should we have a different moral\ncode or legal code as wediscover the brain basis for\nsome of these things?Or is that irrelevant?What counts is the action.", "start": 240.0, "heat":

find terrible.And what does that mean about\nlegal and moral decisionsabout how to punish those\nor think about those?So that's coming in\nyour lifetime.Because there's steady\nprogress on this.And how to think about that\nis really a big question.So I'm going to talk with you\ntoday about research inpsychology.And a funny thing about\npsychology, and I'll come backto this, is everybody is an\namateur psychologist.They have to be.If you deal with people,\nyou're an amateurpsychologist.Moreover, we live in a world\nwith Oprah Winfrey and Dr.Phil, right?So in case you're only an\namateur one, you hear allkinds of stuff, newspaper,\ninternet, magazines.Everywhere you go, friends\nwill tell you stuff aboutpsychologists have\nfound this orpsychologists have found that.So you have your own intuitions\nto deal with peoplein everyday life.And here's a kind of a sentence\nfrom Time Magazinethat drives psychologists crazyif you take it seriously.So here's the literal\nsentence.\"Almost half of children of\ndivorces enter adulthood asworried, underachieving,\nself-deprecating, andsometimes angry young\nmen and women.\"So that sounds kind of like a\npsychological study of somekind, kind of, right?Somebody who wants to argue\nabout the importance ofdivorce and breakdown\nof the family, thisis the kind of thing.So let's think about\nthis for a moment.Almost half of children\nof divorce enteradulthood as worried.Are you guys worried about\nglobal warming?A little.Are you worried about peace in\nthe Middle East and how thatinfluences the Middle\nEast and the US?A little.Are you worried about an economy\nthat may not have jobswaiting for you?A little.Who's not worried a little\nbit of the time?So it doesn't even tell you that\nhalf of children in theworld, for example,\nare who come fromfamilies without divorce.Because that's the only\nrelevant question.It's not are people worried\nabout stuff.Underachieving, compared\nto what?How would you prove somebody's\nunderachieving scientifically?", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.255}, {"text": "Most of you probably have\nhad days where you'veunderachieved and days where\nyou've achieved pretty well.But how would you measure\nand prove that?Self-deprecating, well,\nsometimes I think that'sactually kind of nice if\na person's modest.What's the difference between\nmodest and self-deprecation?And I like this one, sometimes\nangry young men and women.Are you sometimes angry about\nsomething or another?And if you are, does that tell\nus that society's breakingdown and your parents\ndid somethingbad that you're sometimes?Who as a human being is\nnot sometimes angry?So here's a kind of\npsychology-sounding sentenceon a serious topic, which is\nwhat is consequences ofdivorce in families?Should we be thinking about\nthings that encouragemarriages to stay stable\nand things like that?But there's really no\ninformation at all from aresearch or science\nperspective.So I'm going to talk about a\nlittle bit just reminding youwhat science is, we're at a\nuniversity, obviously, thatthinks about science and does\nscience all the time, remindyou of what an experiment is,\na very brief history ofpsychology experimentation, and\nthen walk you through afew experiments that I find kind\nof interesting, and thensome topics related\nto psychology.So let me start with this.How do you know what is true?How do you know what is true,\nthat you take to be true?What is the answer?Everybody's looking like\nhow do I know it.Please tell me.Well, when people try to analyze\nthis, and you canthink about it for\nyour own self,one of them is authority.Parents, teachers, textbooks,\nscientists, professors, andcourses, we tell you\nthis is the truth.And if you remember the truth\ncorrectly, you get an A. Soauthority is a huge\nsource, right?It would be costly to go around\nand kind of have yourown idea about everything.12 inches in a foot?I'm not taking that piece\nof information withoutskepticism, right?You couldn't lead your life\nwithout kind of believing alot of stuff.But you don't want to believe\neverything, right, justbecause you hear it.Repetition or tenacity, you hear\nsomething often enough,", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.232}, {"text": "and people tend to\nbelieve stuff.A priori, what's reasonable?You think things through.Just by thought, what's\npossible, rational, and so on?Then maybe a fourth brand of\nknowledge, too, something isscientific analysis where we\nhave hypotheses and we testthem and some version of\nexperiments or at leastcorrelations among data.Now, there's another view, which\nis kind of whatever wethink makes something science\nis what the scientificcommunity decides as a\ncommunity is true.Roughly speaking that is the\nmainstay of faculty of placeslike MIT and Stanford and\nHarvard and so on and aroundthe world at universities\ntell you, thisis how science works.You go, OK, that's how\nscience works.I remember some years ago there\nwas a lot of excitementabout a satirical article\nwritten by a scientist wherehe said, oh, this is all just\nsocietal authority.The scientists tell you what's\ntrue just because they believein it just like a sports\nwriter says theCeltics are the best.You don't really think that\nthe sportswriter knowscientifically the Celtics\nare the best, right?He wrote a paper saying that\ngravity is simply a consensusamong scientists and a\nparticular view they'refoisting on society.But none of us would want to\nreally go up there and jumpout the window going,\nwell, gravity isone person's opinion.And now here's my\nopinion, right?But it's kind of interesting.Because for those of you who\ngo to medical school, forexample, you learn lots of\nprocedures and so on that themedical committee believes\nis true.But there's not much scientific\nevidence behind it.But they have to use\nit every day.So you're used to hearing about\nthe scientific method.It applies to psychology in many\nways just like it appliesto chemistry, physics,\nor biology.We have to test things\nthat are falsifiable.We have to deal in probabilities\nof outcomes interms of statistics\nin some sense.The kinds of data we can have\nare descriptive or correlativeor experimental.I'll talk about those\nin a moment.We are always trying to disprove\nthe null hypothesis", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.186}, {"text": "statistically as you know.We can't prove that\nsomething is true.But we can prove that\nit's not true.And then finally, like all\nfields of science, today'smost exciting breakthroughs\nare tomorrow's things thathave to be apologized for\nand rediscovered, right?I mean what makes something\nbreaking science is not thatit's known with certainty.What's known with certainty\nis what's in yourtextbook kind of.What makes something breaking\nscience is itmoves the field forward.So what's the difference between\nthe cutting edge andthe bleeding edge is\na very close call.So here's a cartoon that says,\nhe's constantly proving hisexperiments wrong.And the guy's kind of\nglum looking over.He's proving the null hypothesis\nto be correct.Now, that's sort of funny\nfor scientists.But it's sort of funny in the\nsense that, no, we don'treally go around going, I hope\nwith all of my heart for thisresearch project I worked on for\nthe last five years thatit will prove the\nnull hypothesis.There's no difference between\nthings I'm studying.In fact, scientists, like all\nhumans, have agendas and hopeslike everybody else.So they observe, hypothesize,\nexperiment.So the data, it doesn't always\ngo perfectly, right?And the last thing I want to say\nis I'm going to emphasizetoday a scientific approach to\nthe human mind and behavior.But of course, there's many\nother paths of knowledge forimportant things in our life:\nreligion, philosophy,arts, and so on.There's many things that\nscience cannot address.And I don't want to pretend\nthat it does.That's not a problem\ntoo much whenyou think about chemistry.It's kind of an interesting\nproblem when you think aboutpsychology.Because when we think about\nhappiness or values or thingslike that, those topics cut\nacross psychology and thingslike religion, philosophy,\nand topics like that.So what makes something an\nexperiment is you have to havesort of two things conceptually\nespecially, thedependent variable, what you\nmeasure, the outcome, and theindependent variable,\nwhat you vary.Once you have those things in an\nexperiment, you're kind ofan experiment in\na broad sense.So in psychology, it\ntook a long time.It wasn't until the 1800's that\npeople had kind of an", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.295}, {"text": "approach to doing experiments\nin psychology and figuringout, for example, how to use the\nsimple measurement of timeto measure how long a mental\noperation lasts in your mind.So that's pretty cool.If you were to come to a fifth\ngrader and say, how would youmeasure, not a brick or a stone,\nbut how long a thoughttakes, you would say, well,\nthat would be pretty hard.But it turns out it's not\nas hard in a simple way.So Wilhelm Wundt, big figure in\npsychology, first textbookin psychology, first laboratory\nin psychology, didthe following test of mental\nchronometry, simply measuringhow long it takes you\nto do things.So he would show you a light.And you'd simply press\nthe button.And that would take about\n1/5 of a second.And then he would say,\ninstead, you do this.If the light turns on and it's\nred, you push one button.And if it's green,\nyou push another.So his idea was the motor system\nto push the button isabout the same.The time to observe the light\nis about the same.But the difference between these\ntwo is how long it takesto make a choice, how long it\ntakes to make a choice.And that difference, when he\nsubtracts them, took about1/10 of a the second by\nthat measurement.So all of sudden you could\nstart to measure, in anobjective sense, how long\na mental operationtakes in your mind.Then psychology went a lot\nof different directions.A famous one from Titchener,\nwho worked with Wundt,developed a psychology\ndepartment at Cornell, wasintrospection, look\ninside yourselfand think very carefully.When you think about a topic,\nhow do I think about it?That lost its way as a\nscientific method.The trouble is one person\nthinks one way.And one person thinks\nanother way.And you can't really\nsettle it, right?So introspection about your\nthoughts is a private process.It's not a public measure that\nyou can exchange amongscientists, like time\nor measurements.But we still introspect a\nlot when we think aboutpsychology, whether it feels\nright to us, what are thequestions to ask.But still just being human, you\ncan't help but introspectabout psychology topics.In the US, there was a sort\nof a huge response to", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.275}, {"text": "introspection as being\ntoo loosey goosey.One famous name in this\nis John Watson.He said the mind is\nunobservable.So we can only study behavior,\nthings that people do,actions they take.Their mouth moves.Their hand presses.And then we identify what in\nthe environment influencesthose behaviors.The principles of the mind\nshould be similar betweenanimals and humans.And that the only thing a\nresponsible experimentalscientist can do is relateenvironmental factors to actions.And so there's a stimulus.And you can control the stimulus\nas a scientist.There's a response.You measure the response.And that's your psychology\nexperiment.And then the 1980's became\nthe cognitive revolution.Partly this path lead to not,\nafter a while, to not veryinteresting science.That was the biggest problem.And people said, no, we can make\ninferences about the mindas it translates what it hears\nor sees into what a persondoes so representations or\nknowledge in the mind or inthe brain later on and how that\ntranslates what's outthere and how you act upon it.So I'll remind you of a\ncouple more things.And then we'll get\nto specifics.So correlations you can only get\nin an experiment, right,where you have an independent\nvariable.Sorry.Correlations you can look\nat all the time.Experiments only allows\nus to infer causation.So let's pick an example when\nI read that struck me asslightly relevant so age\nof parent and risk fordisease in a child.So most of you are young enough\nthat you're not tooworried about this yet.And you have no reason to be.But for those of us who are\nin my generation and somegenerations back, many people\nare postponing childbirth asthey do their careers and\ncomplete different tasks.And parents are getting older.They don't only seem old.They are old.It's the case statistically\nthat, the older the mother is,the higher the risk of\nDown's Syndrome.So the statistics are, if a\nmother is age 20 to 24, it'svery rare to have\nDown's Syndrome.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.182}, {"text": "And the number goes

20-year-old actress,\nright, that kind of model thatyou see all the time.Because it doesn't matter\nhow old the guy is.Well, it turns out\nit does matter.And here's some data for that.So here's the probability of\ndeveloping schizophrenia, adisease that's typically\ndiagnosed in a person's lateadolescence or 20s depending\non the age of the father.And you can see if the father\nis less than

there's a correlation\nbetween age and whether achild expresses schizophrenia.So let's guess about the\npossible causes of that.I can tell you, it's unknown.But let's even begin\nto guess about it.Let me ask you to\nguess about it.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Maybe the gametes\nbecome damaged by age.PROFESSOR: Yeah, bad sperm,\nright, for some reason, insome way, and sperm that leads\nmore likely to be risk

people want to\nknow such a thing?Well, you might want to\nunderstand what pressures arewe putting young people under\nas they go through gradeschool and high school\nand college.What's the world like?Is it pretty much the same?Is it pretty much changing?Now, how would we figure that?How would we begin\nto measure that?It's a very simple question.Are you more stressed than\npeople 10 years ago

outcomeof stress of a kind.But there's a lot of things\nthat are going--So you have to worry\nabout two things.One thing we know is-- let\nme ask another one.You could compare your level of\nstress to people who are 10years older than you or 20\nyears older than you.What do you think about that?Yeah?Yeah?AUDIENCE: It would actually be\nmore accurate if you measured,if you want to know for college\nstudents specifically,you'd have to be the baseline\nof yourself from somewhere[INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Yeah, because maybe\npeople who are 30 or 40 aremore stressed for other reasons\nbecause they have morebills and mortgages to pay or\nless stressed for otherreasons or whatever, right?Maybe it's not about the\ngeneration you're in.Maybe it's about being\na person with moreresponsibilities at 40, right?So for some things you\nget some luck.And you have it in your hands.So here's an emotional health\nquestionnaire where studentsacross the country for the last\n25 years have been giventhe identical questionnaire.It's a questionnaire, it's not a\nbiology measure, about theirself-reported measure\nof stress.And this was on the New York\nTimes just a few weeks ago.It's you guys on average

on average, report\nfeeling more stressed.And it may be relevant that on\naverage, for example, there'sa higher rate of depression\namong women than men.There's a much higher rate of\nautism among men than women.So being one sex or the other\nis not a gift certificate ofavoiding mental health\nchallenges.So you're more stressed\nthan ever.Good luck.We'll try to do the best we\ncan in this course to

years ago.So on average you guys,\nliterally, on average by thesemeasures, are more\nstressed and lessempathetic towards others.Sorry.This is not an individual.This is an average, right?So the levels that society\noperates, things are going onand moving for some reason.By the way, I can tell you that,\nwhen I'm stressed, Ihave less room to\nbe empathetic.So maybe these things\nare related.If you're feeling stressed, your\nfirst thought is not howcan I help others but how can\nI just get through the day?So these things might\nbe related.So let's turn a little bit to\nexperimentation and some ofthe challenges of relating\npsychology to real worldpolicies that are meant to make\nthe world better or saferin some way.So there's a famous broken\nwindow theory from thepolitical scientist James Wilson\nand the criminologistGeorge Kelling.And their idea was this that,\nespecially in neighborhoodsthat are not immaculately kept\nor to say it the other waywhere there's a lot of damage\naround you, things like brokenwindows is the phrase they used,\nthat this promotes inpeople who live in that\ncommunity or work around thatcommunity to sense that\nthe rules don't count.Anybody can do anything.And then it fosters the growth\nof petty crimes.And once you do a petty crime,\nyou're more vulnerable orwilling to do a major crime,\na slippery slope.And in fact, Rudy Giuliani and\nCommissioner Bill Brattonemployed this.They asked the police to write\nlots of tickets and make lotsof sort of minor arrests for\nthings where people weren'tupkeeping the environment to\nwhere they were littering orthings like that.And this is a huge debate.Because in a police department\nyou can only do so much.So if they have a person working\non jaywalking and", "start":

the crimes went way\ndown in New York.In most cities now, you don't\nhear crime discussed as a bigtopic nationally.In some local areas, like\nin Boston, somespecific areas, you do.I don't think in the State of\nthe Union there was a wordabout crime that I can\nremember a week ago.It's not a big national topic.In some local places, it is a\nbig topic, but not nationally.So you don't know some years ago\nwhen people said New YorkCity was this horrible place\nto go because there was somuch crime that you'd walk out\nfrom your airplane and getmugged before you made\nit to your taxi.It was like the whole country\nwas saying big cities werejust crime-ridden\nand dangerous.They do this policy.Things get better.So everybody says, hmm, that\nsounds pretty good.But of course, it's\nnot an

number ofpossible criminals in those\nareas, account for thereduction in crime all by\nitself, a completely differentinterpretation that has nothing\nto do with the policy.It just said we can have a\ndemographic shift, which willhave a weird unexpected\nconsequence of lowering thecrime rate because it's the\nfinding that young men, inparticular, are most likely to\nengage in violent criminal",

werehappening that moved\nthe crime rate.And here's some very sort\nof perverse or otherexplanations.So that left the question,\nis brokenwindows even a good idea?Just because Harvard--and we know Harvard\nis always right--but just because a Harvard\npsychologist says prettyinterestingly, that sounds right\nto me, is that even aright idea?So let's take a step back.Can we test that\nexperimentally?So here's the experiment.And the idea is, again, that,\nwhen people observe thatothers violate a social norm or\nlegitimate rule, are theymore likely to violate it?If you see people around you\nbreaking rules, are you morelikely to do it?And you could say, it\nseems like it is.But let's do the science.So here's an independent\nmeasure.I'll show you the environment.The dependent measure is\nthe number of peoplewho perform a violation.Now, you can't go getting people\nmurdering each otherand stuff for an experiment.But you can do this.You can have two conditions.So

leaflet on\nyour windshield wiper.So they put it out.And they either had a wall like\nthis, which was clean.There's a sign that\nsays no graffiti.And they put on those\nwhite pieces ofpaper onto the bikes.Or they put a lot of graffiti\non the wall.And people came out from\ntheir classes.They parked their bike.They ran into class.They came out.And they got all these\nwhite leaflets.And what they did is watched.And they said, how many people\nput the leaflet away?And how many people crumpled\nit up and threw it right onthe ground?So we don't know what they're\ngoing to do with the leafletafter they put it away.But we could hope they're\ngoing to throw it out.But the one thing we know for\nsure, if you crumple it up andthrow it on the ground, it's\nlittering and not a goodsocial norm.And

breaking the rules\nall the time, twice as likelyto throw a piece of paper\non the ground.So that shows that people very\neasily are influenced by verymild perceptions of whether\npeople are following

they\nhad a placebo.And there was no difference\nwhatsoever between those whotook the active drug and those\nwho took the placebo.The difference was those who\nfollowed the instructions totake the

this.Medical school interviews, those\nof you who will apply tomedical school will\nget interviews.You'll get interviews\nfor jobs.You'll get interviews for all\nkinds of things in your life.What's the evidence that\ninterviews areany good for anything?How could you know whether\ninterviewsare good for anything?A company interviews you.A university interviews you.How would you even\ndecide whether?So I can tell you this.Social psychologists have\nshown repeatedly thatinterviews are cesspools\nfor discrimination.Because people tend to like\npeople who are like them.Oh, you went to

by background, byappearance, and so on.On average, they try not to.They try to be fair.So we know that.So here's what they did.Yale compared students who were\naccepted or rejected onthe basis of an interview.So they all had scores that\ngot them to the interview.And then they looked at them\nwhere they went in pairs orlarger than pairs to other\nmedical schools.So let's say you got\naccepted by Yale.And you were accepted or\nrejected on the interview.But you ended up as two students\nat Penn or twostudents at Michigan.You're sitting next\nto each other.One of you was accepted\nby interview at Yale.One of you was not.Who does better at\nthat other place?They're dead even.The interview added nothing\nfor predicting grade pointaverage or completion\nof medical school.Here's one more

thing\nyou might think theinterview might have done.But we don't know.What do you think it\nmight have done?So the outcome was your grades\nin medical school and yourlikelihood of completing\nmedical

self-esteem.And in fact, higher self-esteem\nis correlated withhigher initiative and\npersistence, happiness andemotional resilience, and also,\nunfortunately, withpeople who are narcissistic\nand bullies.And how they measure it, just so\nyou know, because this is aproblem, too, how do\nyou measure it?There's several scales.But the most widely used scale\nis this Rosenberg scale.So you have that, too,\nif you want totry it out on yourself.Self-report, and when they\nreviewed 15,000 studies someyears ago, they could find\nno evidence that higherself-esteem leads to\nbetter things.It all

they were praised for\ntheir hard work.This shows a lot of hard\nwork, different kids.And some kids got no praise\nat all in this experiment.Then they get a task that's\neven a little bit harder.How does the different kind of\npraise influence things?And here was the finding.If you were praised for your\nintelligence, you did worse onthe second test.If you were praised for your\nhard work, you did better.If nobody said anything, your\nperformance didn't change.And the idea is this.You understand, praised for\nyour intelligence, you didworse on a hard task.Praised for your effort,\nyou did better.And here's the idea that, if\nwe praise people for theirintelligence to build up their\nself-esteem, they start tocare more about how their\nperformance reflects on themthan the performance
