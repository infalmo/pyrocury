LO: So on\nbehalf of the Sloan SchoolI want to welcome all of you\nto 15.401 Finance Theory.This course is meant for\nfirst year MBA students.And so that's the\nfocus, and I'm goingto assume that that's the\nbackground that all of youwill have.We may have a few other\nstudents in the class,but primarily it will\nbe first year MBAs whoare thinking about\na career in finance,as well as those\nof you who aren'tsure about a career in finance\nbut are curious about it.Hopefully over the\nnext 13 weeks we'llbe able to satisfy\nthat curiosity.I want to start by\ntalking a little bitabout what finance is, and\nhow I got interested in it,because I think it's\noften helpful in orderto motivate a subject\nto get a sense of howsomebody else decided to\nchoose this as a profession.To do that I have to\ngo back a little bit,and give you some\nbackground aboutmy own educational experiences.So let me start by\nmentioning that I'vebeen at MIT for\nthe past 20 years,and been in the finance\ngroup all that time.Before that I taught at the\nWharton School for four years.And before that, I got\nmy PhD in economicsfrom Harvard University,\nand then graduated in 1980from Yale also\nmajoring in economics.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.702}, {"text": "And during that time I've\nlearned an enormous amountboth about finance\nand the real world,but one of the things\nthat I keep coming back tois the fact that\nthe finance fieldis almost unique in how it\napplies to practical managementproblems.And what I want to try to\ndo over the next 13 weeksis to convince you of\nthe fact that financeis in fact, the most\nimportant subjectthat you'll ever encounter.That in fact, finance is\nat the core of everythingthat you will ever do in\nbusiness and in management.Now that's a tall\norder I recognize,and I suspect that\nsome of you arequite skeptical about the\nrole that finance might playin your own career objectives.And I know many of you have very\ndifferent career objectives.And I'm not even trying\nto convince all of youto go into a career\nin finance, but Iam trying to convince all of\nyou that finance is reallythe lifeblood and\nthe basic linguafranca of all of business.And that's one of the\nreasons why financeis such an important subject.Now before I begin, let\nme ask you a question.How many people have had no\nfinance background whatsoever?Oh, that's great.I look forward to a challenge.But the other\nreason it's great isI have to tell you that it's\na real privilege for me to behere in front of you to\ntell you about financefor the very first time.And it reminds me a\nlittle bit of my youngerson who is an\nextraordinarily fussy eater,he's eight years old now.But ever since he was born\nhe had some allergies,and he just refused to\neat most of everything.In fact, my wife often says that\nmy younger son is a vegetarianexcept he doesn't\neat vegetables.So he's an incredibly\nfussy eater,and somehow when\nhe was one year oldhe saw my older son\neating an ice cream cone,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.214}, {"text": "and figured that that's\nsomething he ought to try.How he figured that\nout, I don't know.But he tasted it for\nthe very first time,and you could see his face\nchange in about four secondsfrom disgust to curiosity\nto absolute, you know,enthrallment with the taste\nand feel of ice cream.He just loved it thereafter.That's one of his\nmajor food groups now.It's ice cream.And so I feel privileged to be\nable to share that experiencehere in the sense that once\nyou get a taste of finance,I think you're going\nto be incrediblyexcited and enthralled\nby the subject.Because it's one of\nthe few subjects,in fact, that's the only\nsubject that I've encounteredthat is both rigorous,\nit's extraordinarilychallenging from a research\nand intellectual perspective,and at the end of the day\nit's extremely practical.In fact, I would say\nit's indispensablefor financial management.So I'm going to try to convince\nyou of that over the next 13weeks, and I'm going to do\nthat by going over materialthat you will find\nindispensable.As many of you know, at\nthe end of the coursewe have a ritual where we\nhand out teaching ratings.And among the finance faculty,\namong all the faculty,we're very concerned\nabout good teaching.So these teaching\nratings actually matter.And I've always thought that\nhaving a teaching ratingsurvey at the end\nof the semester,is somewhat misguided.What I'd like to do,\nand what I've proposedhasn't been adopted\nyet, I proposeto have teaching\nratings submitted fiveyears after a course is done.Now this may be a problem\nfor some people who aren'tup to speed in the classroom.But the reason I say this\nis, because it will onlybe after you get into your\njobs, into your careers,before you realize\nhow useful finance is.And five years from now,\nI suspect all of youwill come back\nand say, gee, thisis one of the most important\ncourses you have ever taken.Not because of me, but because\nof the substance of what", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.201}, {"text": "we're going to cover\nover the next 13 weeks.It's because of you\nand all of the workthat you will put\ninto this course.This will be the most\nchallenging courseyou will ever love.So I-- stealing\nfrom the military--I think that you'll\nreally appreciatehow the discipline\nof financial logicwill help you to think smarter\nabout all of your managementdecisions no matter what you\ndecide to do with your careers.Now that's a very tall order.I've built up expectations.So I'm going to have to\ndeliver over the next 13 weeks,and we'll see whether\nor not we can do that.But let me start now\nby talking about whatwe're going to cover today.I want to start with a\nlittle bit of motivation,and then talk about\nthe dramatis personae.These are the cast of\ncharacters that we'regoing to be focusing on\nover the next 13 weeks.And then I'm going to lay out\nthe fundamental challengesof financial analysis.It turns out there are only two.There are only two challenges\nin financial analysis,and once you figure both\nof those out, you're done.So if by chance you\ncan figure that outbefore the end of\nthe class, you don'tneed to come back for\nthe rest of the lectures.Then I'm going to\nturn to providing youwith a framework for thinking\nabout these financialchallenges.To me it's very important to\nhave a framework to start with,because I like to\norganize my thoughtsinto things that I know and\nthings that I don't know.And of the things that I know,\nhow did it relate to the stuffthat I already knew,\nor thought I knew.So I want to give you a sense\nof that kind of frameworkto think about financial\nanalysis upfront.You probably won't fully\nappreciate it at this point,but sometime over the next\n13 weeks you will get it.And so I want to\ngive that to youso that you can start thinking\nabout it subconsciously,unconsciously, and\nthen eventually youwill understand how all\nthe pieces fit together.I then want to talk\nabout the importanceof two aspects of\nfinancial analysisthat make finance different\nfrom every other discipline you", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.19}, {"text": "will ever encounter here\nat MIT and elsewhere.And that is time and risk.Without those two\nfactors it turns outthat finance is actually done.In other words, there's no\nreal research challenges,no open questions left once\nyou eliminate time and risk.Put in another way,\nthe only reasonthat there exists a finance\ndepartment, and financefaculty, and finance journals,\nand a finance industry,the only reason is\nbecause of time and risk.So I'm going to\ncome back to that.Then I'm going to conclude\nby giving you the sixbasic principles of finance.These are principles\nthat you will encounterin all of your finance courses\nfor the rest of your stayat MIT and elsewhere.These are the ideas,\nthe fundamental ideas,that have shaped\nfinancial marketsand that are at the root cause\nof all of the financial marketinnovations, as well as all\nof the financial market crisesthat we've seen including\nwhat's been going onover the last several months in\nthe subprime mortgage market.In fact, we're going to talk\nabout the subprime mortgageproblems after we cover\nfixed income securities.Right now I suspect\nmost of you knowthat there's something going\non, know that it's bad stuff,but you don't know\nwhy, how, where, when,and what to do about it.Well, in about five\nlectures, you will.It's not complicated, but\nit's different from anythingthat you've ever encountered.And in fact, financial\nanalysis, I suspect,is different from anything most\nof you have ever encountered.I'm hoping that by\nthe end of the course,it will change the way you\nthink about everything.And again, I recognize\nthat that's a tall order,but you tell me\n13 weeks from nowwhether or not I've delivered.And then I'll conclude by\ntalking about the courseoverview, and then\nfinally I wantto say a few words\nabout how as a studentyou can get the most\nout of this course.This is a part of the\nlecture that I've alwaysfelt is critical at the\nvery start of a courselike this, because there\nare a number of challenges", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.206}, {"text": "that you will face\nover the next 13weeks regarding this material.And I've always\nthought that it wouldbe helpful for the instructor\nto let me know wherethose challenges\nmight come from,and what I should do\nin advance to preparefor those challenges.So I'm going to do that at the\nend of this hour and a half.For next time I'd like you\nto read Brealey and Myers,chapters one and two.We are going to be covering that\ntoday as well as next Monday.So please keep up\nwith your readings.And at the end of\nthis lecture, Iwill talk a bit about\nthe course requirementsand other aspects of\nthe course mechanics.Any questions?All right, let me start\nwith some motivationabout why you might\nwant to study financeand why finance is so important.And I've always found that with\nmotivation it's really bestto do it in a personal way.That is, to try to find\nan individual or a groupof individuals that personify\na particular disciplineor endeavor.And so there are\nthree people that I'dlike to introduce you to.I suspect you'll know at\nleast two out of the three,but my guess is you\nwon't know all of them.The first person--\noh, before I dothat, I want to introduce a\nvery simple definition of whatfinance is.So this is the\nvery first equationthat you'll ever\nsee in this course,and there'll be many\nothers of course.But the first expression\nof exactly what is financeis this, finance is simply\nequal to mathematics plus money.Now that suggests that\nmathematics as a disciplineis equal to finance\nwithout the money,but really that's not my point.Although it's true by the\nway, that's not my point.My point is that\nfinance is the study,the systematic and disciplined\nstudy of financial transactionsof money.Now when you see this you\nmight think, well, gee,", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.184}, {"text": "I don't really have a\nstrong math background.Maybe I'm in the wrong\nplace or the wrong class.And I want to explain to\nyou that that's completelyinaccurate, and inappropriate.When I say mathematics,\nI'm actuallytalking about a very wide\nrange of mathematics.Everything from\nthe extraordinarilycomplex and profound to\nthe extremely pedestrianand obvious.So literally the range\nfrom differential geometryand partial\ndifferential equationson one end of the spectrum\nto arithmetic and high schoolalgebra at the other\nend of the spectrum.Now since this is an\nintroductory finance class,I assume that you know nothing.What I mean by that\nis, I assume that thereare no prerequisites that you\nhave other than what it tookfor you to get\ninto here, which ispretty substantial by the way.Congratulations to all\nof you for getting in.But we're not\nrequiring that you haveany background in quantitative\nanalysis, computers,upper level mathematics.So when I say finance is equal\nto mathematics plus money,there's a variety of\nkinds of mathematicsthat can be appropriate\nfor creatingan extraordinarily profitable\ncareer in this industry.And now here are\nthe three examples.Anybody know who\nJames Simons is?Who is he?AUDIENCE: Well, I know\nabout Renaissance.ANDREW W.

Chern\na particular field of studyin differential geometry called\nChern-Simons theory, whichhas subsequently proved\nto be extraordinarilyuseful in an area of physics\nknown as string theory.Extraordinarily abstract.And Simon started a hedge\nfund about 20 years ago.And this is probably the single\nmost successful hedge fundin the history of the industry\nin terms of its performancerecord.Over the course\nof 15 or 20 years,he's put together a track\nrecord that has literallybeaten every other hedge\nfund manager's trackrecord by a lot.So it's not just a little bit.He's just sort of way out there.He's the Michael Phelps\nof quantitative investmentstrategies.By the way, just to give you\na sense of how successfulhe has been.In 2006, two years\nago, it was reportedby Institutional\nInvestor's Alpha Magazine--this is a trade publication for\nthe hedge fund industry-- itwas reported that James Simons\nwas the single most highlypaid hedge fund\nmanager that yearwith a take-home\npay of $1.7 billion.Now, that's not\nwealth, that's income.That was on his W-2.That was one year's\ncompensation.And he did it--he did this by building\na quantitative

"It's extraordinarily secret.But there's no doubt that\nhe's incredibly successful.So that's one end\nof the spectrum.That kind of mathematics\ncan make money,and can be extraordinarily\nrelevant

terms of wealth.At the time, February of 2008,\nhe was worth $62 billion.In fact, in a\nprivate conversationI was told that when Simons\nfound out he said, really?$62 billion?How did he get that?It's amazing.That's an extraordinary amount\nof wealth for an individualto put together.And what's extraordinary\nabout it, is how he did it.As many of you know Warren\nBuffett is an investor basedin Omaha, Nebraska.His office is probably smaller\nthan many of the conferencerooms here at Sloan.The number of people he has\nworking for him, I suspect,is fewer than many\nof you who havedone your startups or plan to.He's got an extraordinarily\nsmall staff.Mainly it's Charlie\nMunger and him,and a couple of\nsecretaries, and maybea few accountants here and\nthere, and lawyers of course.But what he does is to read\ncompany prospectuses, incomestatements, balance sheets.And with literally\nhigh school arithmetiche's built this incredible\ninvestment empireby looking at valuation.Simple accounting.Now I say simple accounting,\nbut there's nothing simpleabout what he does.And so clearly he\nhas certain skillsthat also involve\nmathematics, but notthe kind of mathematics\nthat James Simons uses.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And finally, the\nthird individualthat I'd like to introduce you\nto is this fellow, Jack Welch.Now again, many of you\nknow him or know of him.You know that he actually\nteaches a course here at Sloan.But you may not know\nthat his PhD was actuallyin engineering.And he started out at\nGeneral Electric in 1960.Became CEO in 1981, and\nat that time the revenuesof General Electric was\nabout $26 billion a year.So it was already a big\nand successful company.And Jack Welch took\nit over in 1981.At the time there were 400,000\nemployees for General Electric.Five years later, there\nwere 300,000 employeesat General Electric.He eliminated 100,000 jobs.That's one of the reasons why he\ndeveloped the nickname NeutronJack, because like\na neutron bomb,he eliminated a huge\nsegment of the population.But five years later\nwith 300,000 employees,he increased the market\nvalue of General Electricby several fold.And at the end of his tenure\nin 2001, 20 years later,General Electric's revenues\nwas not $26 billion,it was $130 billion.He increased it by a\nfactor of 4 and 1/2over the course of 20 years.It's an extraordinary\naccomplishmentfor an individual.Now why do I put him up here?It's because one of\nthe things that Welchdid at General Electric,\none of the thingsthat he was extraordinarily\ngood at, was makinggood decisions about\ninvestments, makinggood decisions about costs,\nbeing able to understandthe language of finance\ndespite the factthat he used none of his\nPhD skills in his job.He was an engineer by\ntraining, not a manager.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.858}, {"text": "He didn't go to\nmanagement school,although he did a lot\nof executive educationafter his PhD.The reason that I give you\nthese three cast of charactersis because they are so\ndifferent in what they do.They have such\ndifferent backgrounds.They're all\nextraordinarily successful,but there's one thing in common.The thing in common is that\nthey all understand innately,deeply, fundamentally,\nthe language of finance.And what we're going to\ncover over the next 13 weeks,are the very basics.Things that they\ntake for granted.Things that they use on a\ndaily basis to do their jobs.So it's not to say that if\nyou do well in this courseyou'll end up being\none of these guys,but it's certainly a\nprerequisite I would say.There's nobody that's been\nsuccessful in business,truly successful, without having\nan understanding, at leastan innate or instinctive\nunderstanding,of the concepts that we're\ngoing to cover over the next 13weeks.So to me, that's exciting.Now again, I'm not trying\nto motivate you by greed.I'd rather motivate you by\nthe intellectual challengeof finance, and there will\nbe some extraordinarilychallenging ideas.Ideas that are not natural\nfor any of you at this point,but which I hope\nwill be very naturalat the end of this 13 weeks.So let me start with\nthe cast of charactersthat we're going to be studying\nover the next 13 weeks.There are going to be four\ncomponents of the economythat we're going to focus on.Now this is a flow\ndiagram of the economy.Since we're at MIT we\nhave to have flow diagramsat some point, right?So here's my version\nof a flow diagram.This is a flow model\nof the economy,and there are four\ncomponents thatcomprise the financial system.Households, financial\nintermediaries,non-financial corporations,\nand then capital markets.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.346}, {"text": "Now obviously the\neconomy is comprisedof additional components like\nlabor markets and productmarkets.We're not going\nto focus on that.Although there are certain\nfinancial aspects of thosemarkets.Given that we only\nhave 13 weeks,our attention will be spent\non those four components,and I'm going to cover each\nof those four components,both in parallel and to a\ncertain degree sequentially,all right?So I want you to be\nfamiliar with these four,because we're\ngoing to be talkingabout them interchangeably\nat various points in time.Financial analysis applies\nto all of these componentsin exactly the same way.But once you apply them\nto the specific context,the terminology may change,\nthe particular applicationsmay look different.What I'm going to try to\nteach you in this 13 weeksis the underpinning\ntheories thatunify all of the various\ndifferent kinds of ideas.So these are the four\ncomponents that we'regoing to be looking\nat from now and then.Now let me talk about the\nfundamental challengesof finance.I told you that there\nare only two, right?And here they are.There are two aspects\nof financial analysisthat we're going\nto be focused on.The first is the\nvaluation of assets.And the second is very simply\nthe management of assets.That's it.That's all there is to it.Valuing and managing.And I can tell you\nexactly what the managingpart is going to look like.Managing is going to involve\nfiguring out which of twopossibilities is more valuable.And then you know what?You take the more\nvaluable option.That's it.That's all there is to it.Figuring out the value, that's\ngoing to be challenging.So we're going to take\nthat first challengeto start with, and try\nto understand valuation.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.21}, {"text": "I'm going to argue\nthat all businessdecisions, any kind\nof business decision,involves those two challenges.Valuing something, and\nthen once you value it,make a decision on what you\nwant to do with that value.This is why I've\nargued that financeis the most important subject,\nbecause literally any businessdecision that you\nwill ever engage in,constitutes those\ntwo components.Valuation and management.Now valuation is going to\nbe a challenge by itself,because it's not at all clear\nwhat value we're talking about.In other words, what is value?Is water valuable?Well, life can't be\nsustained without it.At least carbon\nbased forms of life.So water is pretty valuable.But water is not that expensive.At least before Poland\nSprings came along.Now what about diamonds?As far as I know, humans do\nnot need diamonds to survive,and yet diamonds are\nextraordinarily expensive.There are certain gems\nthat are invaluable.Now how can that be?Clearly we have to\nthink more carefullyabout what we mean by value.And of course, once\nvalue is established thenmanagement is\nrelatively easy to do.Objectives plus valuations\nobviously leads to decisions.So once you tell me what\nyou're trying to achieve,and then you value all\nthe various differentpossibilities, then I can tell\nyou what the right decision is.Pick the decision that is the\nmost valuable for achievingthe objectives that you want.Now that doesn't\nreally help a lotif we can't apply this\nto specific contexts,and come up with specific value.So I want to hammer\nthis home, and to dothat I want to talk about how it\nis that financial markets helpsus establish value

personal\nperspective as well.Every one of you have to\nthink about these issueson a daily basis.And so finance\nreally is completelyinclusive in the sense that it\napplies to virtually everythingthat you will ever\nencounter in life.To do that I have to\ngo over the frameworkof financial analysis, and the\nstarting point is accounting.Accounting is the language,\nthe lexicon of financein that it's the\nbeginning of howto measure economic concepts.Like profit and loss,\nrevenues and costs, and so on.So while many of you may not\nhave accounting backgrounds,you will learn a fair bit of\naccounting in this course,just because you're going to\nhave to in order to understandthe material in the lectures.So you'll need to get\nfamiliar with the basic termsof accounting, and\nin particular you'regoing to have to focus on two\nconcepts that are probablyalien to you.The notion of a\nstock and a flow.Now when I say stock, I don't\nmean common stock or equities,I have a different term in mind.By stock in this context,\nI mean the stock of assets.The level of assets.And by flow I mean the\nrate of change of assets.You know when I\nwas in grad school,we started discussing this\nconcept on the first dayof macroeconomics, and\nthen one of the studentsin the back of the room\nsaid, excuse me, Professor,but isn't that just the\ndistinction between a variableand its first derivative?And the professor was a little\nbit taken aback and said,well, yes, that's right.But let me give you another\nway of thinking about it thatis somewhat more intuitive.And that is, think\nabout a bathtub,and think about the\nfaucet turned onand the water flowing into it.The stock is the\nlevel of the water.The flow is how fast the\nwater is coming into the tub.", "start":

find\nderivatives intuitive.So to each his own.These two concepts\nare extraordinarilycritical to financial analysis.And accounting counterparts are\nnothing more than the balancesheet and the income statement.The balance sheet measures the\nstock of wealth of a company.What your assets are, and what\nyour claims on those assetsor liabilities are.On the other hand, the flow\nof wealth into a companyor out of a company is measured\nby the income statement.This tells you how\nmuch the companyis making per unit\ntime versus its losses.So the framework for\nfinancial analysisthat we're going to be\ncoming back to time and againis this framework\nof a corporation.A corporation has a\ncertain set of assets.It's got claims on those assets,\nwhich are called liabilities.So this picture, this\nsnapshot, measuresthe level of the bathtub.But that's not\nenough to understandhow a company is doing.You also have to look at\nthe income statement, whichtells you the sources of\nfunds, and the uses of fundsover any time period.Typically on a quarterly basis.So we're going to come back to\nthis concept as the frameworkfor financial analysis.And by the way, this is\nthe sum total of the toolsthat Warren Buffett uses for\nanalyzing his investments.That's it.Believe it or not.Nothing fancier.So it's an incredibly\npowerful set of ideasif you know how to read it.That framework when\nyou

how much cash yougive back to your investors.So from this you\nshould get the ideathat as a corporate\nfinancial officeryou are focused on\ncash, the flow of cash.In fact, cash you can think of\nas

true.And if you don't\nbelieve me or if youknow people that don't\nsatisfy these principles,please introduce them\nto me after class.I'd like to get to know them,\nand do some business with

welfareof the public.But economists in their\nown unique and annoying wayhave been able to redefine\npreferences to even arguethat Mother Teresa is incredibly\nselfish, because her utilityfunction is the\nfunction-- the utilityfunction of other people.And so by doing all\nthis good, Mother Teresawas only furthering\nher own self-interests.Isn't she so selfish.Now, so in a way when the\neconomist defines preferences,they almost define\nit as a tautology.But finance makes economics\npractical in the sensethat I'll describe in\na few weeks exactlywhat kinds of preferences are\nactually embodied

That's it.Everybody gets a B.\nNow before I do this,how many people\nwould object to that?Raise your hand.All right, those of you with\nyour hands up, you get As.Done.You see how brilliant that is?I get a grade distribution.No work.The only problem is\nit only works once.And when you're teaching\ntwo sections, sosomehow the second section,\nit doesn't work as well.So I'm sorry I have\nto give grades.You're all adults.I realize that.But nevertheless, this\nis a necessary partof the curriculum.So that's how we're going\nto be assigning grades.", "start": 3720.0, "heat": 0.241}, {"text": "In the last four\nminutes, and I thinkI'm going to try to keep on\ntime for the entire semesterso we end at five\nbefore the half hour,and we start five\nafter the hour.In the last four minutes,\nI want to tell youa little bit about how to get\nthe most out of this course.And we can take this up next\ntime if you've got questions,but I want you to spend\ntime thinking about this.Most of this course will\nbe devoted to theory.But finance is not a\ntheoretical subjectunlike algebraic topology.That's a theoretical subject.I've never heard anybody\nbecome a practical or appliedalgebraic topologist.Finance on the\nother hand, there'sno finance without practice.So while the course will\nbe focused on the theory,I need you to think about\nthe practical elements of it,and I'm going to help you in\na couple of different ways.One is by problems,\nbut the otheris to encourage you to sit\nin on a pro-seminar calledthe Practice of Finance.This is a new pro-seminar\nthat we're launching.September 17 is\nthe first meeting.It doesn't carry any units,\nso you can come and goas you please.But it'll give you a sense\nof the practical aspectsof the industry, and in\nparticular informationabout the career\naspects of the industrylike what are starting salaries\nfor financial analysts.Or how do I get a job\nin finance if I don'thave any background in it.It'll go through\nthose kinds of issues.So I'd encourage you\nto keep that in mind.The second thing is with\nrespect to the course,I will give you lecture\nnotes ahead of timefor all of the lectures.I expect you to take a\nlook at them in advance.Just skim them.You don't have to\nread them, and tryto sort out what I'm saying.But I want you to\nskim it at least.And then in class I urge\nyou to take lots of notes,because the lecture notes\nare not meant to be complete.In fact, they are\npurposefully incompleteso that you have\nto use your handand write down your\nimpressions of the materialas I'm speaking.Because in that method,\nyou will actually", "start": 3840.0, "heat": 0.675}, {"text": "absorb more of the material,\nand it'll stay with you longer.I would urge you to review\nthe lectures afterwards.Review what I said.Because you may have\nheard what I said,but you may not have\nunderstood what I said,and you may not be able\nto apply what I said.So you need to spend time\nafterwards soaking it in.I urge you to work\non the assignmentsin groups, but also alone.Because when you do the\nmidterm and final exams,you'll be doing them alone.So do both.Don't just assume that you\ncan do the same in groupswhat you will do alone.And finally, I would ask you\nto ask plenty of questions.I'm going to manage\nthe class discussion.So that if we have time, I'd be\nhappy to talk about issues thatare current and on your mind.Even whether or not you should\nrefinance your auto loan.We're happy to take those\nkind of questions assumingthat it's apropos, and\nthat we have the timeto be able to cover that.I want you to get engaged.I want you to take\nthis course personally,because that's the\nonly way you're goingto really learn the material.All right, thank you very much.We're out of time.We'll see you next Monday.", "start": 3960.0, "heat": 0.547}]
