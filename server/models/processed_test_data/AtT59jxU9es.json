income securities,I want to just\ntake a few momentsto talk a bit about what's\ngoing on in financial markets,also to welcome the prospective\nstudents that we havesitting here in class today.So for once, over the\nweekend, unprecedented thingsdidn't occur.And so I'm glad to report\nthat we're still here.Financial markets\nare still around.And as you know, the government\nhas proposed some measuresto deal with this\ncurrent financial crisis.And at this point,\nit's still unclear asto what they're proposing.But we can actually\nsee from the datawhat the market's reaction is.Last time, remember, we\nlooked at the yield curveand literally, it was just\na week ago that the yieldcurve looked like this.Now remember that\nwe focused on whathappened at the very short\nend of the yield curve,which is three month\nTreasury bills.And last week when we\nlooked at this graph,the yield was about three\nbasis points for a three monthTreasury bill.And we pointed out that\nthat was telling us", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.15}, {"text": "something about the market.In particular, it was telling\nus that the market is panicking.Yeah?AUDIENCE: So aren't we sort\nof in this whole situationbecause looking at the market\ngrossly mispriced things?ANDREW LO: Well, I\nwouldn't say that itwas looking at the market\ngrossly mispriced things.AUDIENCE: The market\nobviously did not officiallyprice this risk, which\nlooking at the market a yearand a half ago, we would\nhave been, oh, here'sthis much risk, this\ncriteria [INAUDIBLE].It turned out to be\nright, totally right.ANDREW LO: Well, there are\na number of things thatare priced into a security.It's not just a risk, but\nit's also a reflectionof supply and demand, right?So in other words, what's\ngoing on here-- the questionthat we want to answer\nfrom looking at the priceis what do we know about what's\ngoing on in the marketplacebased on that price.What is it telling us?The cost of borrowing over\na three month period--when it goes down to\nthree basis points,that's telling you that\nthe price of that security,the price of Treasury bills is\nextraordinarily high relativeto historical standards.Now let's take a\nlook at what happensmore recently, in\nparticular, today,if we go to any of\nthese websites--so in particular, let's go\nback to the Bloomberg sitewhere we originally\nlooked at this.First of all, this is\nnow the yield curve.And it's hard to\ncompare because I'vegot a different\nslide for last weeks.This is just yesterday's,\nthe orange, not last week's.But the one thing you'll note is\nthat at the very short end, nowinstead of three basis points,\nthe three month Treasuryis yielding 41 basis points.What does that tell\nyou about the price?Now, so Treasury securities,\nshort-term Treasury securities,have declined in price\nover the last week.And that's one sign that perhaps\nmarkets are not as panicked", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "as they were last week.There isn't this mad rush to\nget into Treasury securitiesin the short term.All right, so short\nterm means have gone up.Yeah.AUDIENCE: So would\nyou say that thiswould be a lot about the\npsychology of [INAUDIBLE].ANDREW LO: Yeah.AUDIENCE: So what I was\nwondering is when the fact--it seemed like, as you said,\nthere's a flight in liquiditylast week.Now why was there\nsuch a huge movement,or what led to the price\ndropping so much when, I guess,it could be reasonably\nexpected that the price wouldcome back up and so\npeople would justwait it out and take a shot.ANDREW LO: Which price are\nyou talking about dropping?AUDIENCE: I should probably\nsay the yield dropping.ANDREW LO: The yield dropping\nand the price going up.Well, so there are a\nnumber of factors at play,but the current\nperspective that most of ushave in financial\nmarkets about last week--and this is just perspective.Remember, last week\nis not that far away.What happened last\nweek, by most accounts,is that there was a\nvery significant rushto the exits by investors.By rushing to the exits, I mean\ngetting out of risky securitiesand into safer securities.And at this point,\nit doesn't seemlike there's much\nof a safe havenother than US\nTreasury securities,and in particular,\nshort-term securitiesbecause you know you can get\nthe money out over a relativelyshort period of time.So that's what the yield\ncurve told us last week,that three basis points means\nthat basically people didn'tcare about the yield.All they wanted to do was\nto get into US treasuriesat almost any price.OK.This week it's different.In particular, not only has\nthe short-term yield gone up,so now instead of three\nbasis points, we're up to 41.But look at the long\nend of the yield curve.Before, the long end\nof the yield curve--let me just go back and remind\nyou what that looked like.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "At the 30 year, a week ago,\nthe 30 year yield was 4%.Let's take a look\nat what it is today.It's now, the 30\nyear yield, 4.37.That's another big movement.Why is that?Why would the yield for\nthe long-term bond go up?What is the market\nthinking today?AUDIENCE: They might be more\nworried about inflation.The government has\npromised $700 billion.ANDREW LO: OK, so\ninflation has nowbeen incorporated, just\nover the last seven days.So question-- is\nthis price corrector was last week's\nprice correct?Getting to your point,\nI mean, what do we do?Is the short end of the\nyield curve appropriate todayat 41 basis points, or was it\nreally appropriate at threebasis points?There's no answer\nto that questionbecause there is\nno right answer.These prices are a reflection\nof the current expectationsof all the market participants.Right or wrong,\nit really reflectsthe combined either\nwisdom or fear or greedof the marketplace.And so our approach is to try\nto understand what that is.We want to explicate\nthe information thathappens to be in\nprices, but you haveto understand that these are the\nsame imperfect kind of pricesthat we came up with\non day one when youbid for that little package.And it turned out\nthat you got luckyand got an iPod\nfor whatever, $45.But it could've\ngone the other way.And in fact, , in the second\nclass it did go the other way.So we won't talk about that.The prices reflect all aspects\nof the economy,

into\nTreasury bills?Well this goes to the heart\nof why the Treasury actedso quickly, and why Chairman\nBernanke has said that he wantsto get a quick resolution.Something very significant\nhappened last week.And I don't know how many of\nyou really got wind of it.Certainly, the Treasury\nknew what was going onand the Fed did, but it\nwasn't really highlightedin the newspapers\nin the way that Iwould have thought\nit should have been,given the importance.Anybody know what\nI'm talking about?Yeah.AUDIENCE: Stopping\nthe short sell--ANDREW LO: Well, that\nwas one piece of news.The SEC mandated that\nfor a period of time,to be determined,\nwe are not allowedto short sell financial\nstocks because they wantedto stop the kind\nof run that therehas been on these securities.I'm going to come\nback and talk about itin the end of this lecture\nbecause we're goingto talk about short sales.But that's not what\nI was referring to.That's certainly a concern, but\nthat's not the major concernthat I think the market\nwas responding to.Yeah.AUDIENCE: Was it the $8 billion\nof redemption in money funds?ANDREW LO: That's right.Where was that coming from?What was going on with that?Why did that happen?AUDIENCE: Because people\nare losing confidencein the short-term\ndebt securitiesto put in money market funds.ANDREW LO: And\nwas there a reasonfor that loss of confidence?I mean, money funds, what does\nthat have to do with mortgagesand Lehman and Goldman?What's the connection?AUDIENCE: Well, I\njust think more of itwas a psychological reaction\nthan it was an actual--ANDREW LO: Absolutely, it\nwas a psychological reaction,but did something trigger that?Is that psychological reaction\ncompletely unreasonable?If your grandmother asked\nyou what she should do nowwith her money market\nfund, should youtell her, don't worry about\nit, just stay the courseand see what happens?Something happened last\nweek that is related exactlyto that issue.So you're on to

remember?AUDIENCE: Lehman, no, no.ANDREW LO: The Reserve Fund.AUDIENCE: It's the Reserve.ANDREW LO: The Reserve\nFund is one of the first,if not the first,\nmoney market funds.And what is a money market fund?Do we know what that is?You all know what that\nmoney market fund as?You all probably have money\nin a money market fund.Whether you know it or not.Money market fund is\na fund that containsrelatively short-term\nand supposedly risklesssecurities, like\nCDs, treasuries,and other kinds of\nvery, very safe assets.And what does it mean\nto break the buck?AUDIENCE: That for every\ndollar that people investedin money market funds had\ninvested what they wouldbe able to redeem at that time.ANDREW LO: Right.AUDIENCE: --less\nthan already spent.ANDREW LO: Right.Breaking the buck means\nthat when you put in $1,money funds are supposed to be\nso safe that at the very leastwhen you withdraw the money,\nyou're going to get $1 back.Breaking the buck means\nthat if you withdraw,there is a possibility that what\nyou withdraw is less than $1.Now that's scary because\nthink about a bank--when you put your money into\na checking account for a bank,you expect to get\nthat money out, maybenot with a lot of interest,\nmaybe even with no interestif things don't go well, but you\nexpect to get what you put in.You expect to get the\nprincipal back, right?Well, money market funds\nare very much the same way.People use them as if they\nwere checking accounts.In fact, there are\nmoney market fundswhere you can write\nchecks on them, right?And so breaking the buck\nhas been a major concern,not just among the money\nfunds, but among regulators.Because if it turns out\nthat retail investors,ordinary consumers are\nscared about what's", "start": 600.0,

mentioned\nearlier, no businesscan sustain a massive withdrawal\nof all capital all at once.It's just not possible\nfor a businessto be able to be\nconducted in that manner.If that happens, we\nwill see mass failuresof financial institutions that\nwill make the last four weekslook like the good old days.And that's what the\nFed is concerned about.That's what the Treasury\nis concerned about.And so the hope is that the\nmeasures that they put in placewill calm the fears\nof the public.That's the first\norder of business.It's calming the\npsychological kinds of effectsthat these headlines\nhave produced.And so the hope\nis that once theyput these measures\nin place, thatwill take care of the concerns.What they've done is to propose\nto guarantee money marketfunds the same way that the\nFDIC guarantees your bankingaccounts.And the way that the SIPC\nguarantees your brokerageaccounts.And there are other measures\nthat have been proposed.We won't have time to\ntalk about them here,but over the next\ncouple of weeks,the finance group\nat the Sloan Schoolwill be putting together some\nkind of a panel discussionthat will focus exactly\non these issues.So we'll let you know\nwhen that happens.And we'll take on these issues\nhead on in that session.OK, but it looks like\nfor the moment, at leastfrom the yield\ncurves that we saw,that things are\nactually quieting down.We'll see on a day by day basis.So this is obviously last week.This week, we have yields\ngoing up a little bit,so that suggests\nthat there isn'tthe same kind of pressure.But every day is another\nday and with another setof revelations.So by looking at these\npieces of information,we can actually glean what\nthe market is thinking.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Is it right?Of course not.All forecasts are\nby constructionincorrect to some\ndegree, but it'sa window on exactly what's\ngoing on in the marketplaceand what people are thinking.Yeah.AUDIENCE: Sorry, what's the\nconnection between this moneymarket issue and\nthe yield curve?Could you make the\nconnection again?I missed it.ANDREW LO: Yeah, sure.So the money market\nconcern is that whatpeople thought were\nsafe, apparently is notas safe as people thought.And the Reserve Fund breaking\nthe buck-- by the way,breaking the buck\nin that case meantthat if you put in a\ndollar, when you withdrew,as of last week, you\nwould have withdrawn$0.97 so you'd lost $0.03\nto the dollar, which may notseem like much, but if you went\nto your Bank of America ATMand you did a withdrawal.And for every dollar you put\nin, you'd get $0.97 back,you'd be pretty\nticked off, right?So it's something that\nis of great concernto retail investors.Anyway, so what happened\nlast week was that--actually the estimate, I think,\nis $90 billion. $90 billionof money came out of\nthese funds in a weekand were put into either\ncash in the mattressor were put into\nTreasury securitieslike the three month T-bills.That's what pushed the\nprices of those T-billsup and therefore\ndepressed the yields.And now we're back to a\nsomewhat more reasonable level.I say reasonable because having\nthis kind of a short-term yieldof 40 basis points by historical\nstandards is still pretty low.So there are still many\nnervous investors out therethat are trying to figure\nout what's going onand are waiting for the Treasury\nto come up with something.This is another reason\nwhy Chairman Bernanke saidwe have to act quickly\nbecause markets are notgoing to stand and wait\nfor the Treasury or the Fedto do something.Markets will react.And if we wait too long, the\nfear of this breaking the buck", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "could actually return.And then once you\nhave a mass panic,it's

calm down, stop it.Slow down.You can't easily do\nthat once it begins.So you've got to stop\nit before it actuallygets to that critical point.And that's exactly what the\ngovernment is trying to do.Yes.AUDIENCE: When you say that--\nif you interpret these,like the prices went down so now\nthere's less demand so it meanspeople are more relaxed--ANDREW LO: Yeah.AUDIENCE: What if you say, like,\nif the interest rate went up,it means they are considering\nthe Treasury billsto be more risky or riskier?ANDREW LO: Well, remember\nthat Treasury billsdon't have any default risk,\nat least as far as we know.We have to be careful\nabout stating.All these unprecedented\nthings have happened.The reason that Treasury bills\ndon't have any default riskis because what the\nTreasury securityis an IOU from the government\nthat says I owe youa certain number of US dollars.And because the Treasury\nowns the printing press,they can always print out more\ndollars to give it to you,as long as you're\nwilling to take it.And at least from this graph,\nit seems like a lot of peopleare willing to take it.They really want\nTreasury bills right now.And they're happy with that.Maybe they're not happy\nwith it, but that'sthe smallest of all the evils\nthat they can think of in termsof putting their money.AUDIENCE: So decreasing\nthe yield in Treasury bondsdo not mean an increase\nin the default risk?ANDREW LO: We hope not.I mean, I guess it\ncould be possiblethat people are betting\nthat the United States isgoing to default in 30 years.But my sense is that\nwhat's more likely,

that the\nprinting presses can alwayscome up with.There's no risk that they\ncan't print up more dollars.The risk is that $1\n30 years from nowisn't going to be\nworth as much as wethought it was\ngoing to be becauseof inflationary expectations.So as of today, that 30 year\nyield is not 4%, it's 4.37%and the 0.37 one could attribute\nto an inflationary expectationby the marketplace.AUDIENCE: Do you think that the\nshort-term change in the yieldhas anything to do with\nthe recent devaluationof the dollar against\nforeign currencies?ANDREW LO: It could be that\nbecause of that devaluation,dollars are cheaper\nand people are puttingmore money into US securities.That's also a possibility.But another way of putting\nthat is that foreign investorsare now finding treasuries more\nattractive for whatever reason.So yes, that's also part of\nthat supply and demand story.OK, last question.Yeah.AUDIENCE: Historically,\nwhat is a reasonable yield?You mentioned that before,\nlike [INAUDIBLE] or before allthis time?ANDREW LO: Well, I'm glad you\nasked that question because wehave a graph.These are the historical yields\nof the three month, six month,one year, two year, five\nyear, 10 year, and 30 yearfrom 1962 to I think it's 2004.And it depends on what\nflavor you're looking at.And it's kind of hard to\nread this graph becauseof the colors.But if you look at\nthe dark blue line,they actually all move\ntogether pretty much.But at one point, that\nshort-term yield was 4%.4% for a three\nmonth Treasury bill.Now these are all\nannualized remember,so 4% doesn't mean\n4% over three months.It means 4% on an\nannualized basis,which is why 41 basis points--that's an annualized yield--for a three month loan\njust seems ridiculouslysmall by historical standards.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "But when people are scared\nabout not getting paid,that kind of fear, that\npsychological pressurecan be overwhelming.And do you believe\nin these

what's going onand how does that\naffect me in termsof the financial decisions\nthat I want to make.So if you are thinking about\npricing other securities basedupon these kinds of\nnumbers, you needto ask yourself\nwhether you believethe numbers make\nsense or are theyjust completely out of whack.And the only way to do\nthat is to understand whatthe basis is for these numbers.So that's where

was wondering, those sort\nof funds, Treasury bills,[INAUDIBLE], is that really\nindividual people buyingthe Treasury bills or is it\nmore hedge funds and that sortof thing that are systematically\nhedging the risk against othersecurities they have that are--ANDREW LO: Well, obviously,\nit's very difficultto tell because we don't see\nwho's making the purchasesand sales, but we can tell\nfrom certain mutual fundsand other money\nmarket flows that itseems like most of the\nflows last week camenot from hedge funds, but rather\nfrom retail investors thatwere taking their money out\nof these money market accountsand then putting them into\ncertain mutual funds thatbuy only Treasury securities,\nas well as Treasury securitiesdirectly.All of you can actually purchase\nTreasury securities directly.There is a website\ncalled TreasuryDirect.govand you can give\nthem your credit cardand register as a\nuser and actuallyparticipate in Treasury auctions\nand buy Treasury securities.So it was a\ncombination of those.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "But it really seemed like\nit was the retail sector,not institutions, not\nsophisticated hedgefunds that we're trying to do\nsome kind of complex arbitrage.It was just investors\nsaying, I'm really scared,I want to put my money\ninto something that's realand that will be there.And so short-term treasuries\nseemed like an answer.And as we saw from last week,\ngold was the other answer.It's not an answer\nthat I would proposefor the typical investor because\ngold prices are quite volatile.And so you have\nto be very carefulwhen you make an\ninvestment in that securityor in that particular asset.But it is something that\nreflects the state of panicof the marketplace.And by the way, I'm telling\nyou something that you probablyalready know in the sense that--my guess is that deep\ndown inside, all of youare feeling stressed out, right?I mean, you're\nprobably stressed outabout things like what does\nthis mean for the job market,for career prospects, and so on.I would urge you all\nto take a deep breathand not get panicked about\nthat because, as I said,this is the kind of\ndislocation that, while verytraumatic for market\nparticipants todayand for those on the\nlosing end, thereare as many\nopportunities createdas there are taken away.And so my guess is\nthat in a year's time,the job market is going to look\nextraordinarily attractive,particularly for\nthose individuals thatare trained in the science\nand art of financial analysis.So you're all going to be\nvery well equipped for that,even though you may\nnot feel that wayright now because of what's\ngoing on in the marketplace.So I wouldn't panic certainly.And by the way, you can\nsee the opportunitiesthat are already being created.Warren Buffett just\nspent $5 billionpurchasing a stake\nin Goldman Sachs.And we're going to talk about\nthat in a couple of lectureswhen we do common\nstock because Iwant to use it as an example of\ngetting a good deal in markets.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.127}, {"text": "I mean, first of all, Warren\nBuffett given the success he'senjoyed

rights issues.That's $10 billion\nof capital that theyraised relatively quickly.Also Nomura is in\nthe negotiationsto purchase certain\nassets of Lehman Brothers.Lehman has a terrific\nfranchise and hassome very significant operations\nin Asia, as well as in the US.And it's a very smart\nmove on Nomura's partto take advantage of that.So these are the\nkind of opportunitiesI'm talking about.And when Nomura\nbuys Lehman, they'regoing to have to\nhire people in orderto run the operations\nbecause youcan bet that the whole\ndislocation ended upshaking loose a number of\nvery talented

startwhere we ended last time, which\nwas a discussion of couponbonds and how you price\ncoupon bonds simplyas a package or a portfolio\nof pure discount bonds.Underlying this approach\nto pricing coupon bondsis a very important principle.That's a principle\nthat was givento you in the very\nfirst day of classwhere we talked about the\nsix fundamental principlesof financial markets.And it's the principle\nof the law of one price.So what I want to do\ntoday is to focus on thatand talk about the\nlaw of one priceand what it means for things\nlike arbitrage, leverage,short selling, and\nrelative pricing.Those are the key concepts\nwe're going to cover today.So let me talk about\nthe law of one priceand remind you all what it is.It's a very simple idea.It's so simple that you\nmight think it's obvious,but it's got some very,\nvery dramatic implications.The law of one price says that\ntwo identical cash flows musthave the same market price.OK.Let me repeat that.Two identical cash flows\nmust have the same price.Now remember that when\nwe think of an asset.We think of an asset as just\nthe sequence of cash flows.That's what an asset is.So all I'm saying is that when\nyou have two identical assets,they have to have\nthe same price.That's not a very\ncontroversial statement.And this principle is one\nof the most important ideasin all of modern\nfinance because itleads to the pricing of\nall sorts of securities,including all the\nderivatives that have everbeen priced on Wall Street.They use this idea of\nthe law of one price, OK.Yeah.AUDIENCE: But

right?I don't care about\nsupply and demand.Supply may very well\nnot equal demand.That's OK with me.This principle of the law of one\nprice, that two identical cashflows have to have\nthe same marketprice, the only assumption that\nI need in order for that lawto be true is that people\nprefer more money to less money.And it's not even people.I just need one person in\nthe economy that prefersmore money to less money.And I'm happy to volunteer\nfor that position, OK?Why is that?It's because if that law is\nviolated, if you can show metwo identical cash flows that\nsell for different

prices coming down.That provides us with one\nkind of measure of risk.So the kind of measure\nI'm talking aboutis the slope of this line.The instantaneous\nslope that tells usfor a bit of a tweak\nin interest ratesor yield, what does that\ndo to the market price?Because obviously when\nyou're an investor,you're focusing on\nthe price, right?Yield is a convenient\nway of summarizingthe properties of a\nbond, but ultimatelywhat you care about in\nyour portfolio is price.And so the question is for a\nmove in the interest rate, whatdoes that do to the price?Well, it turns out\nthat there is one wayto get at that that is somewhat\nmore intuitive than justlooking at this\nkind of fluctuation.It's called duration and it's\nnamed after a person Macaulaywho first proposed it\nas a way of measuringhow risky a bond is.What Macaulay noted was that the\nlonger the maturity of a bond,the more sensitive is the\nbond price to the yield.So for example, a 30 year bond,\nwhen you move the interest rateby one basis point, will have\na much, much larger pricefluctuation than a\nthree month bond, right?", "start": 3720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Why is that?Anybody give me some intuition\nfor why that should be?Why that makes sense?Why should a longer\nmaturity bondbe more sensitive\nto changes in yield?Yeah, Ken.AUDIENCE: Because\nyou're hanging on,because the cash\nis tied up longer.ANDREW LO: Yeah, and?AUDIENCE: And because the risk--because the opportunity\ncost essentiallyof having that money tied\nup for that long meansyou can't spend it on all these\nother things over those 30years.ANDREW LO: That's right.You're investing for a\nlonger period of timeso, in fact, the\nopportunity costs,as measured by the\nforegone interest,is going to be much larger.In other words, the\ndiscount rate that you use,this one plus r, you've\nraised that to the 30th power,not to the 1/4 power,\nand so something that'sraised to the 30th power\nin the denominator,it has a much larger impact when\nyou perturb that denominatorby a little bit, because you're\nactually increasing that power.You're increasing that\nquantity by that 30th power.Well, so if that's\nthe case, if it'sthe case that the longer the\nmaturity, the more at riskyou are per basis point of\ninterest rate fluctuation,then why don't we just\nmeasure the average durationof the bond?By average duration, I\nmean how long does the bondlast when you weighed it\nby the coupon paymentsthat it pays you?So for a pure discount bond,\nthe duration is simple.It's just the\nmaturity date, right?If you've got a 30 year strip\nthat pays you $1 in 30 years,the duration of that\nbond is just 30 years.But what if you had a\ncoupon bond that paid youcoupons all along the way?Well, then, you should take\na weighted average of the 30years and give some\nweight to the early yearstoo, because the early\nyears are years whereyou're going to receive cash.And therefore, interest\nrate fluctuations", "start": 3840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "are going to affect the\nvalue of those cash flows.So the weighted average\nterm to maturityis simply equal to the sum of\nthe date, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, multiplied by a weight\nfactor that sums to one.And let's just use,\nas a weight factor,the proportion of present value\nof cash flow on that date.So if you take the\nweighted averagewhere you take the weights as\nthe present value of the coupondivided by the present\nvalue of the bond,those weights\ncertainly sum to one.And then you're weighting\nthat by the date,the year that you get paid,\nthat number will give you what'scalled Macaulay duration.So it turns out that the reason\nthat Macaulay duration isinteresting is that when you\ntake a look at bond pricesand you ask the question, for\na certain percentage change,a certain basis point change\nin the interest rate, whatdoes that do to the bond\nprice as a percentageof its current price?So this is the sensitivity.It turns out that you can\nshow that that's actuallythe negative of the\nMacaulay duration dividedby one plus the bond yield.So this is a long way of stating\nthat the duration gives youa measure of how\nsensitive the bondprice is to changes in yield.The longer the duration,\nthe more sensitivethe bond is to changes in yield.And duration now just\nmeans a weighted average", "start": 3960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "of all of the payout dates\nthat a bond will have.If a bond pays a lot\nof its cash up frontand very little\nin later periods,is the duration high or low?AUDIENCE: Low.ANDREW LO: Low.And so if a duration\nis low what that saysis that there's not\na lot of sensitivityto changes in yield on\nthe bond price itself.If on the other hand,\nall of your paymentis out in the future, way\nout in the future, that'sgoing to make it very\ninterest rate sensitive.And the negative\nnumber here indicatesthat there's an inverse\nrelationship between priceand yield.So when bond investors look at\na particular portfolio of bonds,and this is key, they look\nat a portfolio of bondsbecause that's what they're\ngoing to be investing in.When you put your money\nin a money market fundor in a bond fund,\nmedium term, long term,you're not putting\nit in one bond,you're putting it in\na whole set of bonds.Your natural question\nis, how sensitiveis that portfolio to\nchanges in interest rates?And the answer is it's\nrelated to the duration.And so if I told you\nthat this portfolio hasa duration of five\nand 1/2 years,that will give you some\nintuition for how sensitiveor how risky that portfolio is.So duration is a measure\nthat I've defined for a bond,but you can define it\nfor a portfolio of bonds,simply by taking the cash\nflows at every periodand then computing a weighted\naverage where the weights arethe present value of those\ncash flows as a functionof the entire portfolio.OK, so here's an example where\nI've got a four year Treasurynote with a face value of $100,\n7% coupon selling at a $103.50,which yields 6%.", "start": 4080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "That's the yield,\nthat's the why thatmakes this 103.5 equal to\nthe present value of allof those coupon payments\nplus the return of principal.And so here what I've done\nis to calculate for youthe cash flows of the bond,\nthe present value of those cashflows, and then the\nrespective product of ttimes the present\nvalue of cash flows.So you can actually compute for\nyourself that duration number.And you can get a sense\nof exactly what that is.So the duration is\nabout 7.13 years.So duration is a\nmeasurement thatis in units of years\nor half year units.Sorry, 7.13 half year units.And the modified duration is\ngoing to be given by 6.92.Price risk at a\nyield of 3% thereforeis going to be given by just\nthis expression right here.What that says is that\nif the yield moves upby 1/10 of a percent\nor 10 basis points,the bond price is going to\ndecrease by 68 basis points.That will give you a sense\nof how exposed you are.If you have very long\nduration portfolios,that means that you're going\nto be in for a wild rideas interest rates\nswing around a lot.And if you're willing to take\non that risk, that's great,but you're going to be at\nleast compensated for that.Macaulay duration, you can\ncompute it in this way.For intra-year coupons,\nthat's a very straightforwardcalculation.So you want to make sure\nyou know how to do that.You simply just use\nthe usual discountingand dividing the yield by the\nappropriate payment periods.", "start": 4200.0, "heat": 0.33}, {"text": "And now the last concept\nthat I want to cover todayis convexity.Convexity is another\nmeasure of risk.It's the second derivative.What it measures is how the\nsensitivity itself changes.And it turns out that\nconvexity, as a measure,gives you sort of a higher order\napproximation both to the priceof the bond, as\nwell as how the bondis going to move with\nrespect to interest rates.So let me just show you\nwhat the derivation is.It's pretty straightforward,\nbut if you have any questions,I'm happy to discuss it.You take the price of a bond and\nyou take the second derivativewith respect to the yield.What you're going\nto get out of itis an expression\nthat looks like this.Now that expression\nin and of itselfhas relatively little intuition.But let me just write\ndown the percentage changein the first\nderivative as v sub m,and then I'm going to show you\nan interesting relationship.For those of you who remember\nyour high school calculusor college calculus\nclass, you'llremember there's something\ncalled a Taylor approximation,right?Taylor series.This is a method of\napproximating nonlinearrelationships using\npolynomials, powersof the variables in question.If you took the bond price\nas a function of the yield,it's a nonlinear function,\nof course, because you'vegot that discounting going on.Then you can ask\nthe question, howcan I approximate the bond\nprice as a function of the yieldif I'm willing to take a couple\nof terms of the approximation?", "start": 4320.0, "heat": 0.342}, {"text": "And when you do\nthat, you get whatmay look like an\nawful expression,but actually it's quite\nbeautiful in its own right.What this says is that the price\nof the bond at a new interestrate, at a new yield, if\nthe yield changes, thenprice of the bond at\nthe new interest rateis going to be equal to\nthe price of the bondat the old interest\nrate, multipliedby a factor of\nsomething or other.And that factor is\ngoing to be givenby one minus a term that's a\nlinear function of the yield,plus another term that\nis a quadratic functionof the change in the yield.So this is what\nI mean when I saythis is a second order\napproximation to the pricingrelationship.And this basically\ngives us a wayto figure out when yields\nmove, what does thatdo to my portfolio.Now you might be\nthinking, gee, thisis an awful long way to go\nto try to figure that out.Can't we just use\nan Excel spreadsheetand then move the interest rate\nand then recalculate and seewhat that does?Today, you can, but in\nthe 1970s, you couldn't.You didn't have that ability.So much of this framework\nwas developed in the 1970sbecause people wanted to have\neasy ways of not only pricingbonds, but figuring out what\nthe risk of their positionswere as bond traders.And to do that quickly\nis very difficult.You remember the\nstory I told youabout when I got a\nmortgage 20 years agoand the bank loan officer\njust could not figure outwhat my mortgage payments were.She had to go look for a book\nand try to thumb through whatthose calculations are.Well, imagine if you're a\nbond trader trading literallyevery minute of\nthe day, and there", "start": 4440.0, "heat": 0.374}, {"text": "was bond trading going on in\nthe 1970s, believe it or not.You have to figure out\nthese pricing relationships.And it was not so easy.So a number of\nmathematicians came upwith these kind of\nrelationships for bond prices.In fact, it's funny.Bond pricing is actually\nquite a bit moreof a mathematical art\nthan equity pricingsimply because\nwith a bond, therearen't that many moving parts.And so they aren't subject\nto mathematical analysislike this, whereas\nwith stock prices,since there are so many\nfactors impinging on it,the actual tools that\nwe use are quite a bitless

things are never equal,but economists like to\nsay other things equal,it actually makes\nbonds more valuable.In this respect, owning a\nbond actually is sort oflike owning an option.Now you don't
