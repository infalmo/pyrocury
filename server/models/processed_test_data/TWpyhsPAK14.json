Zugoff ?]mentioned that whenever\nwe have done a wavefunction with an\noperator, it collapses.PROFESSOR: OK, so let me\nrephrase the question.This is a very valuable\nquestion to talk through.So, thanks for asking it.So, we've previously observed\nthat observables are associatedwith operators--\nand we'll reviewthat in more detail\nin a second--and the statement was\nthen made, does thatmean that acting on a wave\nfunction with an operatoris like measuring\nthe observable?And it's absolutely\nessential that you understandthat acting on a wave\nfunction with an operatorhas nothing whatsoever to do\nwith measuring that associatedobservable.Nothing.OK?And we'll talk about\nthe relationshipand what those things mean.But here's a very\ntempting thing to think.I have a wave function.I want to know the momentum.I will thus operate with\nthe momentum operator.Completely wrong.So, before I even tell you\nwhat the right statement is,let me just get that\nout of your head,and then we'll talk through\nthat in much more detailover the next lecture.Yeah.AUDIENCE: Why doesn't it\ncollapse by special relativity?PROFESSOR: We're\ndoing everythingnon-relativistically.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Quantum Mechanics\nfor 804 is goingto be a universe in which\nthere is no relativity.If you ask me that more\nprecisely in my office hours,I will tell you a\nrelativistic story.But it doesn't violate\nanything relativistic.At all.We'll talk about that-- just\nto be a little more detailed--that will be a very\nimportant question that we'lldeal with in the last two\nlectures of the course,when we come back to Bell's\ninequality and locality.Other questions?OK.So, let's get started.So, just to review where we are.In Quantum Mechanics\naccording to 804,our first pass at the\ndefinition of quantum mechanicsis that the configuration of\nany system-- and in particular,think about a single\npoint particle--the configuration\nof our particleis specified by giving\na wave function, whichis a function which\nmay depend on time,but a function of position.Observables-- and this is\na complete specificationof the state of the system.If I know the wave\nfunction, I neitherneeded nor have access to\nany further informationabout the system.All the information specifying\nthe configuration systemis completely contained\nin the wave function.Secondly, observables\nin quantum mechanicsare associated with operators.Something you can\nbuild an experimentto observe or to measure is\nassociated with an operator.And by an operator, I\nmean a rule or a map,something that tells you\nif you give me a function,I will give you a\ndifferent function back.OK?An operator is just a\nthing which eats a functionand spits out another function.Now, operators-- which I\nwill denote with a hat,as long as I can remember\nto do so-- operatorscome-- and in particular, the\nkinds of operators we're goingto care about, linear operators,\nwhich you talked aboutin detail last lecture--\nlinear operators come endowedwith a natural set\nof special functionscalled Eigenfunctions with\nthe following property.Your operator, acting\non its Eigenfunction,", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "gives you that same function\nback times a constant.So, that's a very\nspecial generically.An operator will take\na function and give yousome other random\nfunction that doesn'tlook all like the\noriginal function.It's a very special thing to\ngive you the same functionback times a constant.So, a useful thing\nto think about hereis just in the case\nof vector spaces.So, I'm going to consider\nthe operation correspondingto rotation around the\nz-axis by a small angle.OK?So, under rotation around\nthe z-axis by a small angle,I take an arbitrary vector\nto some other stupid vector.Which vector is completely\ndetermined by the rule?I rotate by a small\namount, right?I take this vector and\nit gives me this one.I take that vector,\nit gives me this one.Everyone agree with that?What are the Eigenvectors\nof the rotationby a small angle\naround the z-axis?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's\ngot to be a vector thatdoesn't change its direction.It just changes by magnitude.So there's one, right?I rotate.And what's its Eigenvalue?AUDIENCE: One.PROFESSOR: One, because\nnothing changed, right?Now, let's consider the\nfollowing operation.Rotate by small angle\nand double its length.OK, that's a different operator.I rotate and I\ndouble the length.I rotate and I\ndouble the length.I rotate and I\ndouble the length.Yeah, so what's the Eigenvalue\nunder that operator?AUDIENCE: Two.PROFESSOR: Two.Right, exactly.So these are a very\nspecial set of functions.This is the same idea, but\ninstead of having vectors,we have functions.Questions?I thought I saw a hand pop up.No?OK, cool.Third, superposition.Given any two viable\nwave functionsthat could describe\nour system, thatcould specify states or\nconfigurations of our system,an arbitrary superposition of\nthem-- arbitrary linear sum--could also be a valid\nphysical configuration.There is also a\nstate correspondingto being in an arbitrary sum.For example, if we know that\nthe electron could be blackand it could be\nwhite, it could also", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "be in an arbitrary superposition\nof being black and white.And that is a statement in\nwhich the electron is not black.The electron is not white.It is in the\nsuperposition of the two.It does not have\na definite color.And that is exactly\nthe configurationwe found inside our apparatus\nin the first lecture.Yeah.AUDIENCE: Are those Phi-A\narbitrary functions,or are they supposed\nto be Eigenfunctions?PROFESSOR: Excellent.So, in general the\nsuperposition thank you.It's an excellent question.The question was are these\nPhi-As arbitrary functions,or are they specific\nEigenfunctionsof some operator?So, the superposition\nprinciple actuallysays a very general thing.It says, given any two\nviable wave functions,an arbitrary sum, an\narbitrary linear combination,is also a viable wave function.But here I want to mark\nsomething slightly different.And this is why I chose\nthe notation I did.Given an operator\nA, it comes endowedwith a special set of functions,\nits Eigenfunctions, right?We saw the last time.And I claimed the following.Beyond just the usual\nsuperposition principle,the set of Eigenfunctions\nof operatorscorresponding to physical\nobservables-- so, pickyour observable, like momentum.That corresponds to an operator.Consider the\nEigenfunctions of momentum.Those we know what those are.They're plane waves with\ndefinite wavelength,right? u to the ikx.Any function can be\nexpressed as a superpositionof those Eigenfunctions of\nyour physical observable.We'll go over this in\nmore detail in a minute.But here I want to emphasize\nthat the Eigenfunctions havea special property that-- for\nobservables, for operatorscorresponding to observables--\nthe Eigenfunctions forma basis.Any function can be expanded\nas some linear combinationof these basis functions,\nthe classic examplebeing the Fourier expansion.Any function, any\nperiodic function,can be expanded as a sum\nof sines and cosines,and any function\non the real linecan be expanded as a sum of\nexponentials, e to the ikx.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "This is the same statement.The Eigenfunctions\nof momentum are what?e to the ikx.So, this is the same that\nan arbitrary function--when the observable\nis the momentum,this is the statement that\nan arbitrary function canbe expanded as a superposition,\nor a sum of exponentials,and that's the Fourier theorem.Cool?Was there a question?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: OK, good.Other questions on these points?So, these should not yet be\ntrivial and obvious to you.If they are, then that's\ngreat, but if they're not,we're going to be\nworking through examplesfor the next several\nlectures and problem sets.The point now is to give you\na grounding on which to stand.Fourth postulate.What these expansion\ncoefficients mean.And this is also\nan interpretationof the meaning of\nthe wave function.What these expansion\ncoefficients meanis that the probability that\nI measure the observableto be a particular Eigenvalue\nis the norm squaredof the expansion coefficient.OK?So, I tell you that\nany function canbe expanded as a superposition\nof plane waves-- waveswith definite momentum--\nwith some coefficients.And those coefficients\ndepend on which functionI'm talking about.What these coefficients\ntell me is the probabilitythat I will measure the\nmomentum to be the associatedvalue, the Eigenvalue.OK?Take that coefficient,\ntake its norm squared,that gives me the probability.How do we compute these\nexpansion coefficients?I think Barton didn't\nintroduce to you this notation,but he certainly told you this.So let me introduce to you this\nnotation which I particularlylike.We can extract the\nexpansion coefficientif we know the wave function\nby taking this integral,taking the wave\nfunction, multiplyingby the complex conjugate of\nthe associated Eigenfunction,doing the integral.And that notation is this\nround brackets with Phi Aand Psi is my notation\nfor this integral.And again, we'll still see\nthis in more detail later on.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And finally we have\ncollapse, the statement that,if we go about measuring\nsome observable A,then we will always, always\nobserve precisely oneof the Eigenvalues\nof that operator.We will never measure\nanything else.If the Eigenvalues are one,\ntwo, three, four, and five,you will never measure\nhalf, 13 halves.You will always\nmeasure an Eigenvalue.And upon measuring\nthat Eigenvalue,you can be confident that that's\nthe actual value of the system.I observe that it's\na white electron,then it will remain white if I\nsubsequently measure its color.What that's telling you is\nit's no longer a superpositionof white and black,\nbut it's wave functionis that corresponding\nto a definite valueof the observable.So, somehow the process\nof measurement-- and thisis a disturbing statement, to\nwhich we'll return-- somehowthe process of measuring\nthe observable changesthe wave function from our\narbitrary superpositionto a specific Eigenfunction,\none particular Eigenfunctionof the operator we're measuring.And this is called the\ncollapse of the wave function.It collapses from\nbeing a superpositionover possible states to\nbeing in a definite stateupon measurement.And the definite\nstate is that statecorresponding to the value\nwe observed or measured.Yeah.AUDIENCE: So, when the\nwave function collapses,does it instantaneously not\nbecome a function of timeanymore?Because originally\nwe had Psi of (x,t).PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's\na really good question.So I wrote this only\nin terms of position,but I should more\nprecisely write.So, the question was, does this\nhappen instantaneously, or moreprecisely, does it cease\nto be a function of time?Thank you.It's very good question.So, no, it doesn't cease\nto be a function of time.It just says that\nPsi at x-- whatyou know upon doing\nthis measurementis that Psi, as a function\nof x, at the time which I'llcall T star, at what\nyou've done the measurementis equal to this wave function.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And so that leaves us with\nthe following question, whichis another way of asking\nthe question you just asked.What happens next?How does the system\nevolve subsequently?And at the very end\nof the last lecture,we answered that--\nor rather, Bartonanswered that-- by introducing\nthe Schrodinger equation.And the Schrodinger equation,\nwe don't derive, we just posit.Much like Newton\nposits f equals ma.You can motivate it,\nbut you can't derive it.It's just what we mean by\nthe quantum mechanical model.And Schrodinger's equation\nsays, given a wave function,I can determine the time\nderivative, the timerate of changes of\nthat wave function,and determine its\ntime evolution,and its time derivative,\nits slope-- its velocity,if you will-- is one upon I h\nbar, the energy operator actingon that wave function.So, suppose we measure\nthat our observable capitalA takes the value\nof little a, oneof the Eigenvalues of\nthe associated operators.Suppose we measure\nthat A equals little aat some particular\nmoment T start.Then we know that\nthe wave functionis Psi of x at that\nmoment in time.We can then compute\nthe time derivativeof the wave function\nat that moment in timeby acting on this wave\nfunction with the operator ehat, the energy operator.And we can then integrate that\ndifferential equation forwardin time and determine how\nthe wave function evolves.The point of today's\nlecture is goingto be to study how time\nevolution works in quantummechanics, and to look\nat some basic examplesand basic strategies for\nsolving the time evolutionproblem in quantum mechanics.One of the great surprises\nin quantum mechanics--hold on just one sec-- one of\nthe real surprises in quantummechanics is that\ntime evolution isin a very specific sense\ntrivial in quantum mechanics.It's preposterously simple.In particular, time evolution is\ngoverned by a linear equation.How many of you have studied\na classical mechanical systemwhere the time evolution is\ngoverned by a linear equation?Right.OK, all of you.The harmonic oscillator.But otherwise, not at all.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Otherwise, the equations\nin classical mechanicsare generically\nhighly nonlinear.The time rate of change\nof position of a particleis the gradient of the force,\nand the force is generallysome complicated\nfunction of position.You've got some capacitors\nover here, and maybesome magnetic field.It's very nonlinear.Evolution in quantum\nmechanics is linear,and this is going\nto be surprising.It's going to lead to some\nsurprising simplifications.And we'll turn\nback to that, but Iwant to put that your\nmind like a little hook,that that's something\nyou should markon to as different from\nclassical mechanics.And we'll come back to that.Yeah.AUDIENCE: If a particle\nis continuouslyobserved as a not\nevolving particle?PROFESSOR: That's\nan awesome question.The question is, look,\nimagine I observe--I'm going to paraphrase--\nimagine I observe a particleand I observe that it's here.OK?Subsequently, its wave function\nwill evolve in some way--and we'll actually study that\nlater today-- its wave functionwill evolve in some\nway, and it'll change.It won't necessarily be\ndefinitely here anymore.But if I just keep measuring it\nover and over and over again,I just keep measure\nit to be right there.It can't possibly evolve.And that's actually\ntrue, and it'scalled the Quantum Zeno problem.So, it's the observation\nthat if you continuouslymeasure a thing,\nyou can't possiblyhave its wave function\nevolve significantly.And not only is it a cute\nidea, but it's something peopledo in the laboratory.So, Martin-- well, OK.People do it in a\nlaboratory and it's cool.Come ask me and I'll tell\nyou about the experiments.Other questions?There were a bunch.Yeah.AUDIENCE: So after you measure,\nthe Schrodinger equationalso gives you the\nevolution backwards in time?PROFESSOR: Oh, crap!Yes.That's such a good question.OK.I hate it when people\nask that at this point,because I had to\nthen say more words.That's a very good question.So the question goes like this.So this was going to be a\npunchline later on in thein the lecture but you stole\nmy thunder, so that's awesome.So, here's the deal.We have a rule for time\nevolution of a wave function,and it has some\nlovely properties.In particular-- let me talk\nthrough this-- in particular,this equation is linear.So what properties does it have?", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Let me just-- I'm\ngoing to come backto your question\nin just a second,but first I want to set it up\nso we have a little more meatto answer your\nquestion precisely.So we note some properties\nof this equation, this timeevolution equation.The first is that it's\na linear equation.The derivative of\na sum of functionis a sum of the derivatives.The energy operator's\na linear operator,meaning the energy operator\nacting on a sum of functionsis a sum of the energy operator\nacting on each function.You guys studied linear\noperators in your problem set,right?So, these are linear.What that tells you\nis if Psi 1 of x and tsolves the Schrodinger equation,\nand Psi 2 of x and t-- twodifferent functions of\nposition in time-- bothsolve the Schrodinger equation,\nthen any combination of them--alpha Psi 1 plus Beta Psi 2--\nalso solves-- which I will callPsi, and I'll make it\na capital Psi for fun--solves the Schrodinger\nequation automatically.Given two solutions of\nthe Schrodinger equation,a superposition of them--\nan arbitrary superposition--also solves the\nSchrodinger equation.This is linearity.Cool?Next property.It's unitary.What I mean by unitary is this.It concerns probability.And you'll give a\nprecise derivationof what I mean by\nunitary and you'lldemonstrate that, in fact,\nSchrodinger evolutionis unitary on your\nnext problem set.It's not on the current one.But what I mean by unitary is\nthat conserves probability.Whoops, that's an o.Conserves probability.IE, if there's an\nelectron here, or if wehave an object, a\npiece of chalk-- whichI'm treating as a quantum\nmechanical point particle--it's described by\nthe wave function.The integral, the probability\ndistribution over all theplaces it could possibly\nbe had better be one,because it had better be\nsomewhere with probability one.That had better\nnot change in time.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.143}, {"text": "If I solve the Schrodinger\nequation evolve the systemforward for half an\nhour, it had better notbe the case that the\ntotal probabilityof finding the\nparticle is one half.That means things\ndisappear in the universe.And much as my socks\nwould seem to bea counter example of that,\nthings don't disappear, right?It just doesn't happen.So, quantum mechanics\nis demonstrably-- well,quantum mechanics\nis unitary, and thisis a demonstrably good\ndescription of the real world.It fits all the observations\nwe've ever made.No one's ever discovered\nan experimental violationof unitarity of\nquantum mechanics.I will note that there is\na theoretical violationof unitarity in quantum\nmechanics, whichis dear to my heart.It's called the Hawking Effect,\nand it's an observation that,due quantum mechanics, black\nholes in general relativity--places from which light\ncannot escape-- evaporate.So you throw stuff and\nyou form a black hole.It's got a horizon.If you fall through\nthat horizon,we never see you again.Surprisingly, a black hole's\na hot object like an iron,and it sends off radiation.As it sends off radiation,\nit's losing its energy.It's shrinking.And eventually it will,\nlike the classical atom,collapse to nothing.There's a quibble\ngoing on right nowover whether it really\ncollapses to nothing,or whether there's\na little granulenugget of quantum goodness.[LAUGHTER]We argue about this.We get paid to argue about this.[LAUGHTER]So, but here's the funny thing.If you threw in a dictionary and\nthen the black hole evaporates,where did the information\nabout what made the black holego if it's just thermal\nradiation coming out?So, this is a\nclassic calculation,which to a theorist says, ah ha!Maybe unitarity isn't conserved.But, look.Black holes, theorists.There's no\nexperimental violationof unitarity anywhere.And if anyone ever did\nfind such a violation,it would shatter the basic\ntenets of quantum mechanics,in particular the\nSchrodinger equation.So that's something we would\nlove to see but never have.It depends on your\npoint of view.You might hate to see it.And the third-- and\nthis is, I think,the most important-- is that\nthe Schrodinger evolution, this", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "is a time derivative.It's a differential equation.If you know the\ninitial condition,and you know the derivative,\nyou can integrate it forwardin time.And they're existence and\nuniqueness theorems for this.The system is deterministic.What that means\nis that if I havecomplete knowledge of the\nsystem at some moment in time,if I know the wave function\nat some moment in time,I can determine\nunambiguously the wavefunction in all subsequent\nmoments of time.Unambiguously.There's no probability, there's\nno likelihood, it's determined.Completely determined.Given full knowledge now, I\nwill have full knowledge later.Does everyone agree\nthat this equationis a deterministic\nequation in that sense?Question.AUDIENCE: It's also local?PROFESSOR: It's all-- well, OK.This one happens\nto be-- you needto give me a better\ndefinition of local.So give me a definition\nof local that you want.AUDIENCE: The time evolution\nof the wave functionhappens only at a\npoint that depends onlyon the value of the derivatives\nof the wave functionand its potential\nenergy at that point.PROFESSOR: No.Unfortunately,\nthat's not the case.We'll see counter\nexamples of that.The wave function--\nthe energy operator.So let's think about\nwhat this equation says.What this says is the\ntime rate of changeof the value of the wave\nfunction at some positionand some moment in time is the\nenergy operator acting on Psiat x of t.But I didn't tell you what\nthe energy operator is.The energy operator\njust has to be linear.But it doesn't have to be--\nit could know about the wavefunction everywhere.The energy operator's a map\nthat takes the wave functionand tells you what\nit should be later.And so, at this level there's\nnothing about locality builtin to the energy\noperator, and we'llsee just how bad that can be.So, this is related\nto your questionabout special relativity, and\nso those are deeply intertwined.We don't have that\nproperty here yet.But keep that in your\nmind, and ask questionswhen it seems to come up.Because it's a very,\nvery, very importantquestion when we talk\nabout relativity.Yeah.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "AUDIENCE: Are postulates\nsix and three redundantif the Schrodinger equation\nhas

of the\nsystem, then there'sanother state which\nis a viable wavefunction at some moment in time,\nwhich is also a viable wavefunction.But number six, the Schrodinger\nequation-- or sorry,really the linearity\nproperty of the Schrodingerequation-- so it needs to be\nthe case for the Schrodingerquestion, but it says\nsomething slightly different.It doesn't just say that any\nany plausible or viable wavefunction and another\ncan be superposed.It says that, specifically,\nany solution of the Schrodingerequation plus any other solution\nof the Schrodinger equationis again the\nSchrodinger operation.So, it's a slightly\nmore specific thingthan postulate three.However, your question is\nexcellent because could ithave been that the\nSchrodinger evolution didn'trespect superposition?Well, you could imagine\nsomething, sure.We could've done a\ndiffer equation, right?It might not have been linear.We could have had that\nSchrodinger equation wasequal to dt Psi.So imagine this equation.How

the\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation.Well, people mean\nmany different thingsby the nonlinear\nSchrodinger equation,but that's a nonlinear\nSchrodinger equation.So you could certainly\nwrite this

come back to\nthe question thatwas asked a few minutes\nago, which is, look,suppose we take\nour superposition.We evolve it forward for some\ntime using the Schrodingerevolution.Notice that it's time

save my life.So, the theory of decoherence.And here's roughly\nwhat the theory says.The theory says,\nlook, the reasonyou have this problem between\non the one hand, Schrodingerevolution of a quantum\nsystem, and on the other hand,measurement leading\nto collapse, isthat in the case of measurement\nmeaning to collapse,you're not really studying the\nevolution of a quantum system.You're studying the evolution\nof a quantum system-- iea little thing that you're\nmeasuring-- interactingwith your experimental\napparatus, which is made upof 10 to the 27th particles,\nand you made up of 10to the 28 particles.Whatever.It's a large number.OK, a lot more than that.You, a macroscopic object,\nwhere classical dynamicsare a good description.In particular,\nwhat that means isthat the quantum effects\nare being washed out.You're washing out\nthe interferenceof fringes, which is why\nI can catch this thingand not have it split into\nmany different possible wavefunctions and where it went.So, dealing with that is hard,\nbecause now if you reallywant to treat the system\nwith Schrodinger evolution,you have to study the\ntrajectory and the motion,the dynamics, of every particle\nin the system, every degreeof freedom in the system.So here's the question that\ndecoherence is trying to ask.If you take a system where\nyou have one little quantumsubsystem that you're\ntrying to measure,and then again a gagillion\nother degrees of freedom,some of which you care\nabout-- they're made of you--some of which you don't,\nlike the particlesof gas in the room,\nthe environment.If you take that whole\nsystem, does Schrodingerevolution in the end\nboil down to collapsefor that single\nquantum microsystem?And the answer is yes.Showing that take\nsome work, and we'lltouch on it at

the rest of todayis talk about solving\nthe Schrodinger equation.So when we set about solving\nthe Schrodinger equation,the first thing\nwe should realizeis that at the end of the\nday, the Schrodinger equationis just some\ndifferential equation.And in fact, it's a particularly\neasy differential equation.It's a first order linear\ndifferential equation.Right?We know how to solve those.But, while it's\nfirst order in time,", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "we have to think about what\nthis energy operator is.So, just like the Newton\nequation f equals ma,we have to

example.So one strategy to solve\nthe Schrodinger equationis to say, look, it's just\na differential equation,and I'll solve it using\ndifferential equationtechniques.So let me specify, for\nexample, the energy operator.What's an easy energy operator?Well, imagine you had a harmonic\noscillator, which, you know,physicists, that's your go-to.So, harmonic\noscillator has energy psquared over 2m plus

squared upon 2m.Psi prime prime.Let me write this as dx squared.Two spatial derivatives acting\non Psi of x and t plus momega squared upon 2x\nsquared Psi of x and t.So here's a\ndifferential equation.And if we want to know how\ndoes a system evolve in time,ie given some initial\nwave function, how does itevolve in time, we just take\nthis differential equationand we solve it.And there are

probability\nthat at time tI will measure the particle\nto be at position x,or the probability density?Well, the probability density\nwe know from our postulates,it's just the norm squared\nof the

we just get nas the sum of the\nenergy Eigenstateby just applying that and\nby just measuring that?PROFESSOR: Excellent.So, here's the question.The question is,\nlook, a minute agoyou said no system is truly in\nan energy Eigenstate, right?But can't we put a system\nin an energy Eigenstateby just measuring the energy?Right?Isn't that exactly what the\ncollapse postulate says?So here's my question.How confident are\nyou that you actuallymeasure the energy precisely?With what accuracy can\nwe measure the energy?So here's the unfortunate\ntruth, the unfortunate practicaltruth.And I'm not talking about\nin principle things.I'm talking about it in practice\nthings in the real universe.When you measure the energy of\nsomething, you've got a box,and the box has a dial,\nand the dial has a needle,it has a finite width,\nand your current meterhas a finite sensitivity\nto the current.So you never truly measure\nthe energy exactly.You measure it to\nwithin some tolerance.AndIn fact, there's a\nfundamental bound--there's a fundamental bound on\nthe accuracy with which you canmake a measurement, which\nis just the following.And this is the analog of\nthe uncertainty equation.We'll talk about\nthis more later,but let me just jump\nahead a little bit.Suppose I want to\nmeasure frequency.So I have some\nsignal, and I lookat that signal for 10 minutes.OK?Can I be absolutely confident\nthat this signal is in facta plane wave with the given\nfrequency that I just did?No, because it could\nchange outside that.But more to the\npoint, there mighthave been small\nvariations inside.There could've been\na wavelength thatcould change on a time\nscale longer than the timethat I measured.So, to know that the\nsystem doesn't changeon a arbitrary-- that\nit's strictly fixed

arbitrarily precise\nmeasurement of the energy.What do I have to do?I have to wait forever.How patient are you, right?So, that's the issue.In the real world, we can't make\narbitrarily long

the\nSchrodinger equation.And in particular, what\nthat tells me is-- well,another way to say\nthis is that if Iknow that Psi of x times zero\nis equal to sum over n-- soif sum Psi of x--\nif the wave functionat some particular\nmoment in timecan be expanded as sum over\nn Cn Phi E of x, if this ismy initial condition,\nmy initial wave functionis some superposition, then I\nknow what the wave

energy operator,\nwe find its Eigenfunctions.Any wave function Psi at\nx-- we'll say at time zero--any function of x can\nbe expanded as a sum.Specific superposition sum\nover n Cn Phi E sub n of x.And if any function\ncan be expandedas a superposition of\nenergy Eigenfunctions,and we know how to\ntake a superposition,an arbitrary\nsuperposition of energyEigenfunctions, and find\nthe corresponding solutionto the Schrodinger equation.What this means is, we can take\nan arbitrary initial conditionand compute the full solution\nof the Schrodinger equation.All we have to do is figure out\nwhat these coefficients Cn are.", "start": 3600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Everyone cool with that?So, we have thus, using\nsuperposition and energyEigenvalues, totally solved\nthe Schrodinger equation,and reduced it to the problem\nof finding these expansioncoefficients.Meanwhile, these expansion\ncoefficients have a meaning.They correspond\nto the probabilitythat we measure the\nenergy to be equalto the corresponding\nenergy E sub n.And it's just the norm\nsquared of that coefficient.So those coefficients\nmean something.And they allow us to\nsolve the problem.Cool?So this is fairly abstract.So let's make it concrete\nby looking at some examples.So, just as a quick aside.This should sound an awful\nlot like the Fourier theorem.And let me comment on that.This statement originally was\nabout a general observableand general operator.Here I'm talking\nabout the energy.But let's think about a\nslightly more special example,or more familiar example.Let's consider the momentum.Given the momentum, we can\nfind a set of Eigenstates.What are the set of\ngood, properly normalizedEigenfunctions of momentum?What are the Eigenfunctions\nof the momentum operator?AUDIENCE: E to the ikx.PROFESSOR: E to the ikx.Exactly.In particular, one\nover 2 pi e to the ikx.So I claim that, for every\ndifferent value of k,I get a different value of p,\nand the Eigenvalue associatedto this guy is p is\nequal to h bar k.That's the Eigenvalue.And we get that by acting\nwith the momentum, whichis h bar upon i, h bar times\nderivative with respect to x.Derivative with\nrespect to x pulls downan ik times the same thing.H bar multiplies the\nk over i, kills the i,and leaves us with an overall\ncoefficient of h bar k.This is an Eigenfunction\nof the momentumoperator with\nEigenvalue h bar k.And that statement\nthree is the statementthat an arbitrary\nfunction f of xcan be expanded\nas a superpositionof all possible\nenergy Eigenvalues.But k is continuously\nvalued and the momentum,so that's an integral\ndk one over 2 pi,", "start": 3720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "e to the ikx times\nsome coefficients.And those coefficients\nare labeled by k,but since k is continuous, I'm\ngoing to call it a function.And just to give it a name,\ninstead of calling C sub k,I'll call it f tilde of k.This is of exactly\nthe same form.Here is the expansion--\nthere's the Eigenfunction, hereis the Eigenfunction, here\nis the expansion coefficient,here is expansion coefficient.And this has a familiar name.It's the Fourier theorem.So, we see that\nthe Fourier theoremis this statement, statement\nthree, the superpositionprincipal, for the\nmomentum operator.We also see that it's true\nfor the energy operator.And what we're claiming\nhere is that it'strue for any observable.Given any observable, you\ncan find its Eigenfunctions,and they form a basis on the\nspace of all good functions,and an arbitrary function can\nbe expanded in that basis.So, as a last example,\nconsider the following.We've done energy.We've done momentum.What's another\noperator we care about?What about position?What are the\nEigenfunctions of position?Well, x hat on\nDelta of x minus yis equal to y Delta x minus y.So, these are the states with\ndefinite value of positionx is equal to y.And the reason this is true\nis that when x is equal to y,x is the operator that\nmultiplies by the variable x.But it's zero, except\nat x is equal to y,so we might as well\nreplace x by y.So, there are the\nEigenfunctions.And this statement\nis a statementthat we can represent\nan arbitrary function fof x in a superposition of\nthese states of definite x.f of x is equal to the integral\nover all possible expansioncoefficients dy delta x\nminus y times some expansioncoefficient.And what's the\nexpansion coefficient?It's got to be a function of y.And what function\nof y must it be?", "start": 3840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Just f of y.Because this integral\nagainst this delta functionhad better give me f of x.And that will only be\ntrue if this is f of x.So here we see, in some\nsense, the definitionof the delta function.But really, this is a statement\nof the superposition principle,the statement that any\nfunction can be expandedas a superposition of\nEigenfunctions of the positionoperator.Any function can be\nexpanded as a superpositionof Eigenfunctions of momentum.Any function can be\nexpanded as a superpositionof Eigenfunctions of energy.Any function can be\nexpanded as a superpositionof Eigenfunctions of any\noperator of your choice.OK?The special cases-- the Fourier\ntheorem, the general cases,the superposition postulate.Cool?Powerful tool.And we've used\nthis powerful toolto write down a general\nexpression for a solutionto the Schrodinger equation.That's good.That's progress.So let's look at some\nexamples of this.I can leave this up.So, our first example is going\nto be for the free particle.So, a particle whose\nenergy operatorhas no potential whatsoever.So the energy operator\nis going to bejust equal to p squared upon 2m.Kinetic energy.Yeah.AUDIENCE: When you say\nany wave function canbe expanded in terms of--PROFESSOR: Energy\nEigenfunctions,position Eigenfunctions,\nmomentum Eigenfunctions--AUDIENCE: Eigenbasis,\ndoes the Eigenbasishave to come from an operator\ncorresponding to an observable?PROFESSOR: Yes.Absolutely.I'm starting with\nthat assumption.AUDIENCE: OK.PROFESSOR: So, again,\nthis is a first passof the axioms of\nquantum mechanics.We'll make this more precise,\nand we'll make it more general,later on in the course, as we\ngo through a second iterationof this.And there we'll talk about\nexactly what we need,and what operators are\nappropriate operators.But for the moment, the\nsufficient and physicallycorrect answer is,\noperators correspond", "start": 3960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "to each observable values.Yeah.AUDIENCE: So are the set of\nall reasonable wave functionsin the vector space\nthat is the sameas the one with\nthe Eigenfunctions?PROFESSOR: That's an\nexcellent question.In general, no.So here's the question.The question is,\nlook, if this is true,shouldn't it be that the\nEigenfunctions, since they'reour basis for the\ngood functions,are inside the space of\nreasonable functions,they should also be\nreasonable functions, right?Because if you're going\nto expand-- for example,consider two dimensional\nvector space.And you want to\nsay any vector canbe expanded in a basis of pairs\nof vectors in two dimensions,like x and y.You really want to make\nsure that those vectors areinside your vector space.But if you say this\nvector in this spacecan be expanded in terms\nof two vectors, this vectorand that vector, you're\nin trouble, right?That's not going\nto work so well.So you want to make sure\nthat your vectors, your basisvectors, are in the space.For position, the basis\nvector's a delta function.Is that a smooth, continuous\nnormalizable function?No.For momentum, the\nbasis functionsare plane waves that\nextend off to infinityand have support everywhere.Is that a normalizable\nreasonable function?No.So, both of these\nsets are really bad.So, at that point you might say,\nlook, this is clearly nonsense.But here's an important thing.So this is a totally\nmathematical aside,and for those of you who\ndon't care about the math,don't worry about it.Well, these guys\ndon't technicallylive in the space of\nnon-stupid functions--reasonable, smooth,\nnormalizable functions.What you can show is that\nthey exist in the closure,in the completion of that space.OK?So, you can find a\nsequence of wave functionsthat are good wave functions,\nan infinite sequence,that eventually that\ninfinite sequence convergesto these guys, even\nthough these are silly.So, for example, for the\nposition Eigenstates,the delta function is not a\ncontinuous smooth function.It's not even a function.Really, it's some god- awful\nthing called a distribution.It's some horrible thing.It's the thing that tells\nyou, give it an integral,it'll give you a number.Or a function.But how do we build\nthis as a limit", "start": 4080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "of totally reasonable functions?We've already done that.Take this function with\narea one, and if you want,you can round this out by\nmaking it hyperbolic tangents.OK?We did it on one of\nthe problem sets.And then just make it\nmore narrow and more tall.And keep making it more narrow\nand more tall, and more narrowand more tall, keeping\nits area to be one.And I claim that eventually\nthat series, that sequenceof functions, converges\nto the delta function.So, while this function is\nnot technically in our space,it's in the completion\nof our space,in the sense that we take a\nseries and they converge to it.And that's what you need for\nthis theorem to work out.That's what you need\nfor the Fourier theorem.And in some sense,\nthat observationwas really the\ngenius of Fourier,understanding that\nthat could be done.That was totally\nmathematical aside.But that answer your question?AUDIENCE: Yes.PROFESSOR: OK.Every once in a\nwhile I can't resisttalking about these\nsort of details,because I really like them.But it's good to know that\nstupid things like thiscan't matter for\nus, and they don't.But it's a very good question.If you're confused about\nsome mathematical detail,no matter how elementary, ask.If you're confused, someone\nelse the room is also confused.So please don't hesitate.OK, so our first example's\ngoing to be the free particle.And this operator can be\nwritten in a nice way.We can write it as minus--\nso p is h bar upon iddx,so this line is\nminus h bar squaredupon 2m to the derivative\nwith respect to x.There's the energy operator.So, we want to solve\nfor the wave functions.So let's solve it\nusing an expansionin terms of energy\nEigenfunctions.So what are the\nenergy Eigenfunctions?We want to find the\nfunctions E on Phi sub Esuch that this is\nequal to-- whoops.That's not a vector.That's a hat-- such as this is\nequal to a number E Phi sub E.But given this\nenergy operator, thissays that minus h bar squared\nover 2m-- whoops, that's a 2.", "start": 4200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "2m-- Phi prime prime of\nx is equal to E Phi of x.Or equivalently, Phi prime\nprime of x plus 2me over h barsquared Phi of x\nis equal to zero.So I'm just going to\ncall 2me-- because it'sannoying to write it\nover and over again--over h bar squared.Well, first off,\nwhat are its units?What are the units\nof this coefficient?Well, you could do it two ways.You could either do dimensional\nanalysis of each thing here,or you could just know that we\nstarted with a dimensionallysensible equation,\nand this has unitsof this divided by length twice.So this must have to\nwhatever length squared.So I'm going to\ncall this somethinglike k squared,\nsomething that hasunits of one over\nlength squared.And the general\nsolution of this isthat phi E E of x-- well, this\nis a second order differentialequation that will have two\nsolutions with two expansioncoefficients-- A e to the ikx\nplus B e to the minus iks.A state with definite momentum\nand definite negative momentumwhere such that E is equal to h\nbar squared k squared upon 2m.And we get that just from this.So, this is the solution of the\nenergy Eigenfunction equation.Just a note of terminology.People sometimes\ncall the equationdetermining an energy\nEigenfunction-- the energyEigenfunction\nequation-- sometimesthat's refer to as the\nSchrodinger equation.That's a sort of cruel\nthing to do to language,because the Schrodinger's\nequation is about timeevolution, and

different equation.This is telling you about\nenergy Eigenstates, OK?And then more\ndiscussion of this isdone in the notes, which I will\nleave aside for the moment.But I want to do one more\nexample before we take off.Wow.We got through a lot\nless than expected today.And the one last example\nis the following.It's a particle\nin a box And thisis going to be important\nfor your problem sets,so I'm going to go ahead and\nget this one out of the wayas quickly as possible.So, example two.Particle in a box.So, what I mean by\nparticle in a box.I'm going to take a system\nthat has a deep well.So what I'm drawing here\nis the potential energyU of x, where this is\nsome energy E naught,and this is the\nenergy zero, and thisis the position x\nequals zero, and thisis position x equals l.And I'm going to idealize\nthis by saying look,I'm going to be interested\nin low energy physics,so I'm going to just treat\nthis as infinitely deep.And meanwhile, my\nlife is easier if Idon't think about curvy\nbottoms but I justthink about things\nas being constant.So, my idealization\nis going to bethat the well is\ninfinitely high and square.So out here the\npotential is infinite,and in here the\npotential is zero.U equals inside, between\nzero and l for x.So that's my system\nparticle in a box.So, let's find the\nenergy Eigenfunctions.And again, it's the same\ndifferential equationsas before.So, first off, before we\neven solve anything, what'sthe probability that I\nfind x less than zero,or find the particle\nat x greater than l?AUDIENCE: Zero.PROFESSOR: Right,\nbecause the potential", "start": 4440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "is infinitely large out there.It's just not going to happen.If you found it there,\nthat would correspondto a particle of\ninfinite energy,and that's not going to happen.So, our this tells\nus effectivelythe boundary\ncondition Psi of x isequal to zero outside the box.So all we have to\ndo is figure outwhat the wave function is inside\nthe box between zero and l.And meanwhile, what\nmust be true of the wavefunction at zero and at l?It's got to actually\nvanish at the boundaries.So this gives us boundary\nconditions outside the boxand at the boundaries x\nequals zero, x equals l.But, what's our differential\nequation inside the box?Inside the box, well,\nthe potential is zero.So the equation is the\nsame as the equationfor a free particle.It's just this guy.And we know what\nthe solutions are.So the solutions can be\nwritten in the following form.Therefore inside the\nwave function-- whoops.Let me write this as\nPhi sub E-- Phi subE is a superposition of two.And instead of writing\nit as exponentials,I'm going to write it\nas sines and cosines,because you can express\nthem in terms of each other.Alpha cosine of kx\nplus Beta sine of kx,where again Alpha and Beta\nare general complex numbers.But, we must satisfy the\nboundary conditions imposedby our potential at x\nequals zero and x equals l.So from x equals\nzero, we find that Phimust vanish when x equals zero.When x equals zero, this\nis automatically zero.Sine of zero is zero.Cosine of zero is one.So that tells us that\nAlpha is equal to zero.Meanwhile, the condition that at\nx equals l-- the wave functionmust also vanish-- tells us\nthat-- so this term is gone,set off with zero-- this\nterm, when x is equal to l,had better also be zero.", "start":

value of k willit actually hit zero\nat the end of l.We need kl equals zero.Or really, kl is\na multiple of pi.Kl is equal-- and we\nwant it to not be zero,so I'll call it n plus\n1, an integer, times
