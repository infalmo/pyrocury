snow disaster.This week's maybe three\nof them or something.My name's John Gabrieli.This is Introductory to\nPsychology, 9.00.This is a course about you.The entire course is what do we\nunderstand in a scientificway about human nature--how people's minds work, how\npeople's brains work thatsupports their mind.This entire course is about\nwhat's a scientific way tounderstanding how people feel,\nthink, and act in the world.And so we're trying to say that\nwe constantly think youmust in your everyday life think\nabout why do you haveyour preferences,\nyour desires?What's easy for you?What's hard for you?What's delightful for you?Why do other people behave\nthe way they do?How do they think?How do they feel?And so there's a lot of realms\nof this that are tough to getto by science.But what we're going to focus on\nthis semester is where thescientific approach has shed\nlight in the way that we usedto think about experiments\nand evidence,about how humans tick.And as we go through this\nsemester, we'll talk about thebrain, we'll talk a fair bit\nabout chapters from this book,The Man Who Mistook His Wife for\na Hat, from Oliver Sacks.It was a bestseller even when it\nwasn't [? a ScienceWare ?]course.It's a great book.You'll enjoy it.Short, really fun chapters.We'll talk about how we perceive\nthe world; how wesee; especially, a little bit,\nhow we hear; how we think; howwe feel; personality; how we\ndiffer from one to the other;", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.216}, {"text": "and what we're sort of like;\nand how we behave in theworld; development from\nchildhood and infancy throughadolescence, through young\nadulthood, where you aremostly, through getting older,\nwhere I am; socialinteraction, how we behave in\ngroups and think about otherpeople; and variation in\nthe mental health orpsychopathology.And increasingly, we understand\nthat there's a hugenumber of people who, at some\nmoment in their life oranother, struggle with some\naspect of mental health.And then we'll focus a lot on,\nnot only the psychologicalaspects of what we study in\nterms of behavior, but alsothe brain basis of that, and\nthink a little bit about towhat extent the mind is what the\nbrain does, to what extentthe mind is what\nthe brain does.And so for every dimension of\nbeing a human being that we'lltalk about, we'll also talk\nabout what we understandcurrently from the\nneurological andneuroscientific literature\nabout how the human brainsupports and contributes\nto differentaspects of being a person.OK.So everybody who works in a\ncertain field thinks thattheir field is really, really,\nreally special, right?So here's why psychology\nis really,really, really special.So it's really, really special,\nI think, most of all,because every endeavor that we\nundertake at a university orin society as a whole--it's about people, right, except\nfor when we think aboutthe rest of nature.But people study biology,\nchemistry, and physics.And they think, right, that the\nsun orbits the earth forsome period of time.And then they think\nit's the other wayaround currently, right?OK, so people come up with\nthese conclusions.Even though we're trying to\nunderstand nature, it's peoplewho make certain investments\nin economics or behave in acertain way or vote\nin a certain way.It's people who make music and\nappreciate music, make art andappreciate art, read and write\nliterature, right?So in all these dimensions,\nthere's something very", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.191}, {"text": "fundamental about what it is\nabout the human mind thatgives birth to these areas of\ninquiry and how those areas,domains of human experience,\nare enacted.So my only goal today is to\ntry to convince you in anumber of different ways that\nwe're not simple video camerain our minds between our ears,\nrecording the world in someobjective, simple way, that\neven the simplest, mostobvious things are\ninterpretations of the worldaround us at many different\nlevels of thought and feelingand perception.And then our minds, the way\nour minds are constructed,determines the world that we\nexperience, that we see, thatwe act upon.And even very simple things\nthat we think are prettyobjective and simple, right\nin front of our eyes, aredetermined by inferences and\ndeductions that our mindmakes, weighing sources of\nevidence in the world andcoming to conclusions about\nwhat's around us, what wehear, what we see,\nand how we think.So let's start with seeing.If your vision is reasonable,\nwe say we see something, webelieve it, right?So let's start with something\nvery simple--these lines.So one of the tough things about\npsychology is ever sincethe Internet came into\nexistence, people know everycool thing there is\nto know, right?OK.I can tell you when I began\nteaching, people said, oh mygosh, I've never seen\nsuch a thing.It's unbelievable!And then now, it's like two\nthirds of the class is like,yeah, I've got that on\nmy computer at home.We did that in third\ngrade or whatever.So all I'm saying is enjoy the\nones you haven't seen before,don't ruin it for your neighbors\ntoday, because it'sharder and harder to\nsurprise the worldin a nice way, right?OK, but let's look at these\nlines for a moment here.And perhaps you'll have the\nsense, and maybe-- is itglaring up there, sir?Let's see.OK, is that better?OK.Maybe not.So you might have the sense that\nthis line is a differentlength than this line.And this might be somewhere\nintermediate, right?", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.172}, {"text": "Now you know, because of\npsychology, it's all a trick.But what's simpler than\nthe length of a line?What's more objective\nin some sense thanthe length of a line?But if we look at the actual\nlengths, they'reall literally identical.But that center part\nlooks different.So what does it mean for\nit to look different?It means our minds are\ndetermining as simple a thingas how long a line is depending\non the otherinformation surrounding it.It's an interpretation\nin context.If we're simply looking, the\nlines will look the same.Let's try another one.It's remarkable that those two\nlines are identical in length.[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR: OK, all right.It's OK to test the limits\nof the credibility of theaudience, right?All right.Yeah.Of course, if our visual system\nwere ludicrously off,we'd be constantly walking into\nwalls and falling outwindows and things like that,\nright, if we weremisestimating at that length.So the idea where we have visual\nillusions-- and I'llshow you some more that I think\nyou'll be impressed by--it's not that our visual system\nis messed up or thatpsychologists think it's\nhilarious to trick us.It's that lots of things our\nvisual system is a brilliantat, but it's brilliant by\nhaving certain laws orprinciples that it follows.And we can show this following\nthose principles by seeingthat when we mess with the\ntypical circumstances, thoseprinciples calculate\nthe wrong answer.So here's another one.So, to most people, which line\nlooks bigger, the one in themiddle or the one on the side?I know you know it's\nall a trick, right?OK.What could be more obvious\nthan that this is longer?It's just a simple line, but if\nwe draw red lines on top ofit then move them over here,\nthey're dead identical.The central circle--does one of them, the\nmiddle circle, looklarger than the other?Now you already know,\nintellectually, that it willturn out those two circles in\nthe middle will be the same.But you have to convince\nyourself that it still lookslike they're different.Here there in red.Here they are next\nto each other.They're identical.Again, this is evidence that,\neven for a simple thing likethe size of a circle, your mind\nis making inferences.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.383}, {"text": "And there are principles and\nlaws that it's following thatdetermine what it is you\nthink that you see.Here is two monsters\nchasing each other.But in fact, they're\nidentical in size.The perspective cues make\nthe more distantone look much bigger.This is from Ted Adelson.This is a beautiful\ndemonstration of an illusion.Ted Adelson's in the psychology\ndepartment.There's a letter A here.And believe it or not, there's\na letter B there.Let's see if this looks any\nbetter when it goes like this.It doesn't.All right.So one of the important things\nabout illusions,demonstrations in this class--\nand you will learn this as wego along-- is occasionally they\nfail, and we come backand discover what the\nlesson of that is.So I'm just telling you\nit's showing you on mymonitor much brighter.It always has before.We'll adjust that.So I'm going to skip this, but\nI'll show you another time,because it's so good.And I'm going to feel\nbad about this.OK.Now, let's see.This'll work.All the same shade\nof grey, right?[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR: Did that work\nreasonably from where you sat?We'll try a few more.Maybe.For some reason,\nmy connection'salways like this, sorry.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.116}, {"text": "Does that one look lighter\nthan that one that way?Yeah.Now they look radically\ndifferent, right?It's the same grey constantly.But again, the context is hugely\ndetermining how tobright you see that grey.There it is.Two boxes equal grey.So things as simple as how\nbright something is or howlong something is depend\non interpretation.Here's an illusion from\nRoger Shepard.It's kind of great.So here's two kind of differentlooking tables, right?But they're not that\ndifferent.And watch.There goes one tabletop.You're not impressed that those\nare identical tables?OK.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Want me to do it again?That's the identical tabletop.To me, the one on the left looks\npretty rectangular andthe one on the right looks\npretty square-ish.You're not easy to\nimpress, are you?[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR: You see that those\ntwo bars are moving togetherat the same time.Does it look like they're\nlittle steps?It'll show you.All right, fine.It's just like that, but\nnow you add those bars.Does it look like little steps?[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR: One more\nof this kind.This is kind of fun.You see the way that the\nmask is turning?It always looks like it's\ntowards you, even though I'm--one of the rotations-- it's\nbecause of the way you'reinterpreting the light is\ninfluencing how youinterpreting what's--OK.So that's simply a consequence,\nas far as peopleunderstand that, that the source\nof the illumination isnot where you're used to, so\nyou're misinterpreting wherethe illumination is coming\nfrom for the depth of theface, what's front and what's\nback, whether the nose issticking in or sticking out.OK.So again, the point in these\nillusions is, even for verysimple things our, minds make\ncertain assumptions about howwe interpret the world.And that drives everything that\nwe see and how we actupon what we see.So at a slightly higher\nor more conceptuallevel, I need your help.Now, there's lots of these\nthings we'll do this semesterwhere you get to participate.The fun thing about--I said this course was about\nyou-- when you could havethought that was a bit\nrhetorical, it's not.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.161}, {"text": "It's truly about you.So you get to be your\nown

usually\nfun to do them.So what's going to happen\nis I'm goingto show you a drawing.If the people to my left--so about in the middle, but you\ncan decide for yourself--about this way, let's have you\nbe Group A if you're willingto be that way.All right.Because of that, I\ncan't call you--I was going to call you guys\nGroup B, but I already seethat's getting me in trouble.So we'll call it Group B, but\nthat really means equals A.But I'll just call it B, OK?So A and B, OK?So what I need is Group B--B for best, A for awesome, OK.[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR: --Group B to close\nyour eyes for a moment.Group B, if you want to have fun\nwith this, close your eyesfor a moment.Group A, you're gonna see some\ninstructions, and read themsilently to yourself.And then I'll ask you a question\nabout the picture.OK, Group A, you're\nnow reading.Group B has your eyes closed.So read the instructions\nsilently to yourself.OK?Now Group A, close your eyes.Everybody has their eyes\nclosed for a moment.Everybody has their\neyes closed.Now Group B, look at\nyour instructions.So A has their eyes closed,\nB is reading instructions.OK?Everybody's eyes are open now.Everybody's eyes are open.Here's your picture.Take it in and I'm going\nto ask you a fewquestions about it.Look at it for a moment\nand inspect it.OK, here we go, ready?So just out loud--was there an automobile\nin the

Yes.AUDIENCE: No.PROFESSOR: A fish?AUDIENCE: Yes.PROFESSOR: All right, so\nthere's disagreement.And that's--we're a democracy, right?So all these things are\nbig setups, right?So here's what happened.Group A was told they were gonna\nlook at a picture of atrained seal act.And Group B got the identical\ninstructions, but they weretold you're gonna look\nat a costume ball.So you had an expectation of\nwhat you were going to see.That expectation drives your\ninterpretation of the verything you see next, which\nis this picture.OK?[LAUGHTER][CHATTER]PROFESSOR: OK, is\nthat all right?All right.And this is just\nfor fun, right?It's a set up.You're participating nicely.But in the world, when groups\nthat are arguing with eachother about things like peace\nsettlements, read a document,or make a statement, how much\ndo you think the perspectivethey start with guides the\ninterpretation of what theyread or what they hear?Because you didn't have\nbig stakes in this.You weren't going, I believe in\nfish and if I don't see afish, I know things aren't just\nand my group will be nottreated fairly.You're not emotionally invested\nin, probably, whetherthere was a fish

interpretation.OK.Now this is one of those\nexamples that, again, when--some number of years ago,\nit was a huge hit.And now, mostly people say,\ncan't you come up withsomething better\nthat we haven'tall seen on the internet?So if you know this, don't\nruin it for the otherindividuals.But what I need is a\nfew volunteers--you'll be facing me\nthis way-- who arewilling to count something.And it's MIT, we're pretty\ngood at counting.So what's the message of that?The message is--we've talked about what we\nperceive, what we see byexpectations in context.But it's also we have very\nlimited what psychologistscall attentional resources.We can pay attention\nto a limited numberof things at a time.And even when those things can\nbe right in front of us, ifour attention is focused

I'm going\nto replay this.So listen to what the\nguy is saying.Take a look, and\njust tell he--he's saying some letters,\nOK, just not a word.What is it?OK, most people think he's\nsaying \"da.\" \"Da da, da da, dada.\" Now let's try that again.I'm going to turn off the\nsound and I'm going torun the same film.What does his mouth look\nlike it's saying?\"Ga ga.\" OK?But now we'll do one more

you hear.Right?So what you see would\nbe this one thing.What you hear is\nanother thing.When your eyes are open and your\nears are open, they meldtogether and produce\nsomething--a third thing that's\nentirely different.Again, your mind interpreted\nwhat you hear, not your earinterpreting what you hear,\nin a simple sense.OK.How about things that we know?So let's think about this.If somebody were to ask you\nwhich is farther east, closerto the Atlantic--San Diego, California,\nor Reno, Nevada?Who likes San Diego as\nbeing farther east?A few hands.Who likes Reno as being\nfarther east?OK.So, here's the mental map most\npeople have-- the mental map--which is we know California's\nright next to the ocean withArnold Schwarzenegger protecting\nus on that side ofthe country, right?And then Nevada's a little bit\nmore towards Boston, right?OK.That's a mental map that\nmost people have.And that's how the\nhands went up.This is the actual map.And the only actual map you've\never seen, ever-- on a globe,on a map, anything.Because California takes a big\nturn on the south, San Diego'sfurther east than Reno.Why do we imagine, and most\npeople do, that Reno isfurther east, when you've never\nseen a map or globethat's shown you that?Never ever, ever.Yeah.PROFESSOR: Because it's farther\nfrom the ocean,because in our mind we go,\nCalifornia's way out there.There's nothing--Hawaii is the only one out there\nfurther west, right?So our mind makes this\nanswer despite that.And that's what we think\nwe might know.Now, we might not be\ntotally certain.We might not bet the\nfarm on that.Which is farther north--Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,\nor Rome, Italy?", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So start to think-- how would\nyou think about that?It's not something you know.Nobody memorizes it, right?But how would you begin\nto think which isprobably more northern?What's your first gut?How many people like\nPhiladelphia being more north?How many people like Rome\nbeing more north?There's kind of a mixture\nof hands.The answer is that Rome is\nnorth of Philadelphia.Mostly people will answer that\nPhiladelphia is north.Why they do that is they think\nthe US and Europe, they'reboth sort of above the equator,\nbelow Antarctica,kind of a aligned, even\nhistorically, culturally.So they think, well, Rome is\npretty south in Europe.And it is.It's in Italy.Philadelphia's reasonably\nnorth in the US.It gets winters and all\nthat kinds of stuff.So a northern city in the US\nhas got to be north of asouthern city in Europe.But in fact, Europe is-- the\nwhole continent is shifted upcompared to the US.So you won't-- wait until get\nyour mind around this.Which is further north,\nAtlanta or Chicago?[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR: All right,\nall right.Sorry.It's sort of a joke.Because sometimes when you do\nthis, people go like, wait aminute, all my assumptions\nare off.Like, where am I?What's reality?[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR: OK.Here's one more-- two more.Which is further north,\nPortland or Toronto?Now you are already learning\nthe lesson go opposite.Whatever I thought, go\nopposite, right?But why do you think most\npeople will answer thatToronto is further north?Canada is up there, US is\nbelow it, but in fact--that's the mental map\nin the colors.But in fact, Portland\nin Oregon isactually north of Toronto.We'll do one last one.Which is further west?Which is further west, Miami,\nFlorida-- which that's all theway towards the Atlantic\nOcean--or Santiago, Chili-- which is\ntowards the Pacific Ocean.Further west.So most people have a mental\nmap that North America andSouth America are kind of\nlined up like that.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.187}, {"text": "And so you say well, Miami is\nfurther east and Santiago'sfarther west.But in fact, South America is\nfairly shifted compared toNorth America.And Santiago is actually more\neastern or Miami is morewestern, one relative\nto the other.Because in our head, we kind\nof think, North and SouthAmerica-- they're kind of lined\nup even though we neversaw a global map like that.So again, some of our knowledge\nguides how we thinkabout the world and what\nwe believe we know.So what's the point of this?It's what used to be called\ntelephone, right?Their story keeps changing.And it's hard to remember\ndetails in a story.People remember a nugget, or\nwhat we call a gist inpsychology, a little point.And second, what you take as a\npoint is how you then tell thenext person, the way you\ninterpret the story,something like that.Thanks very much,\nthat was good.[APPLAUSE]PROFESSOR: Again, two things--\nour memory for precise detailsis surprisingly modest.And how we interpret things\nmatter changes things a lot.So now, you had four brave\nstudents demonstrating some ofthe limits and properties\nof memory.So now, here's an exercise you\ncan do in your own seat.OK, you're just knowing\nyourself how youdid, but here we go.I'm going to read\nyou some words.And then just give you-- don't\nhave to write anything down.If you write it down,\nit's no good.And then I'm going to ask you on\na recognition test, whetheryou heard a word or not.Ready?So here's the list.So just listen and then\nI'll test your memoryfor it right after.Here's the list.Sour, candy, sugar, bitter,\ngood, taste, tooth, nice,honey, soda, chocolate,

\"Building.\" \"Sweet.\"\nEvery hand up there, you havea false memory.[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR: Now, it's\na set up OK?Because here's the way they make\nthese lists, it's a setup, but there's a huge lesson.And in fact, you may hear\ndebates about what are realmemories, what are false\nmemories, in court cases, inclinical cases.This is a laboratory experiment\nthat's been thetesting ground for lots of ideas\nabout how we make realmemories and how we end up\nwith false memories.So here's the way they\nmade the list.They took the word \"sour.\" And\nthey took a lot of studentsbasically like

tart, pie.But they left out one\nword that peoplecame up with a lot.The word \"sweet.\" OK?So your mind interpreted\nthe list.You said, hey, this is all about\nthings that are relatedto sweet things in one way or\nanother-- sweet sugar, sweetcandy, sweet and sour, honey is\nsweet, chocolate is sweet.So your mind imagined it heard\nthe word \"sweet.\" And themajority of you put your hand up\nthat you actually heard theword \"sweet.\" Your mind imagined\nit was there becausethat was generally what\nwas going on.That was the gist of\nthe experience, OK?So this idea is it's very\neasy, because of the waymemory works, we remember the\ngist of things because that'swhat's the important part.It's hard to remember\nthe details.But that gist is an\ninterpreted gist.The gist was it's\nsweet things.So the word \"sweet\" feels like\nit was part of the memory.And we'll come back to that\nlater on in the course.So one of the themes we'll talk\nabout a lot in the course", "start": 1680.0, "heat":

the vocabulary,\nright?It lets us do a lot of things.So that's the power of it.The peril is when something\nbecomes automatic, we losecontrol of it within\nourselves.So I need somebody at their\nseat

details.You get the big words and the\nbig ideas and you zoom throughfor the big meaning.And you're leaving behind what\nyou consider to be details.Yeah.AUDIENCE: So if you ask this\nquestion to a

a couple times.So let me think about\nthis for one second.Maybe we'll do it this way--\nthat we'll ask somebody attheir seat who has typical\ncolor vision.If you're color blind, this one\nis not a

for yourself.So now we're gonna\nturn to thought.There's 30 people in a room.Just imagine you sat-- there'\njust groups of 30 here.You get the month and date of\neach person's birthday.So it's not the year they were\nborn, but it could be December1 or February 5 or something\nlike that.What is the approximate\nprobability that two peoplewill have the exact\nsame birthday?I can tell you the vast majority\nof people underslightly less suspicious\ncircumstances of this willanswer about 10%.That's the vast majority.The correct answer is--OK?Why do you think--this is work from Kahneman\nand Tversky.We'll come back to this.Why do you think people tend\nto answer 10%, some 30%?Very few people give you\nthe mathematicallycorrect answer of 70%.Why do they do that?Because they tend to think, how\noften have I met somebody", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.225}, {"text": "who has my exact birthday?And you go, not that often.It's not like every 30 people\nI meet, somebody says, youwere born on March 3.I was born in March 3.And then you go have lunch\nand you go, hey, I wasborn on March 3.And you go have dinner with\nanother group and they go, Iwas born on March 3.It's not something that\nhappens a lot, right?So you go, well, in real\nlife it doesn't seemto happen very often.That's what we call a\nheuristic-- a simple way tothink about it.Because your experience\nis kind of like that.But why is that incorrectmathematically for this question?Because the math depends on\nnot that's exactly yourbirthday, but any pair of\nbirthdays among the 30 people.And then it goes way up.In fact, it goes to 70%.And if it's 24 people,\nit's 50%.If you're a group of 36 people,\nthere's a 90% chance,just mathematically, that\ntwo people willshare the same birthday.Because when we face things that\nare hard to think about,because there's no easy answer,\nhumans tend to takeshortcuts and say, what's the\ngist of my experience, andthat's what I think\nthe answer is.Even when a calculable\nanswer is available.It's human nature to make a\nshortcut based on your senseof your experience.So there's a very interesting\nline of work--Dan Gilbert of Harvard\nis a leading figure--about this idea of thinking\nabout your future.Now, thinking about our future\nis a big thing, right?We're thinking about what's it\nlike in this course, what's itlike in college, what's

could work for\nany sports team you've triedout or anything you've tried\nout for in your life.So what happens when we get\nreviewed for tenure?And you hear a bit about that.This was an easy study for\na psychologist to do.What they did is they called up\npeople in the fall who werebeing reviewed for tenure.And you get tenure\nor you don't.And it's a bit of a sad process\nif you don't, right,because you don't get tenure,\nand then you don't feel happyabout that.And you have to call your\nparents and say, I didn't gettenure, and your parents go,\ncome on, if you just sleptbetter, you would've\ngotten tenure.[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR: Remember the piano\nlessons you didn't take.So it's a bit of a\nnuisance, right?On top of that--because weirdly, in academics,\nwe tend to be superspecialized-- you have\nto move out of town.You don't have to, but\ntypically, a person whodoesn't get tenure will get\na job somewhere else.There's plenty of stories of\npeople who don't get tenure atawesome places who were\ngeniuses in history.The tenure decisions\nare often wrong.But still, you'd rather\nget it than not.You'd rather get into the\nmedical school than not.You'd rather make a sports\nteam you wantto be on than not.So here's what they found out.If they asked them what happens\nif you don't gettenure, everybody says, oh,\nit's gonna be awful.It's gonna be miserable.I'm gonna be such an\nunhappy person.Two years later, the average\nhappiness of people who didn'tget tenure was equal to the\naverage happiness of peoplewho did get tenure.So you can say, well,\ntenure-- onlyprofessors care about tenure.Well, how about winning\nthe lottery?What if I won hundreds of\nthousands of dollars?There' been a lot of psychology\non this, actually.In about a year

psychology,\nwe measure things likereaction time to the\nmillisecond.That's good data, right?Our brain activation,\nthat's good data.When you ask a person how happy\nthey are, the only thingwe can do is have you basically\nfill a scale fromone to seven.How happy are you?And you could go, well I'm a\nlittle worried about that,because sometimes people say, I\nhope that it makes you happyor something.So you could say, how\nmuch can we trustsubjective reports of happiness?And that's a very\ngood question.On the other hand, it's hard\nto know what wouldbe better than that.If we measure your\npulse, is that abetter measure of happiness?Your pulse could be racing\nbecause you're sad or happy,scared or enthusiastic.So we don't have a better one\nthat we can think of.But psychologists do worry that\nsometimes people willjust say what they're\nsupposed to say.Or they'll pretend they're happy\nor things like that.We have to worry about\nthose things.So you could worry deep down,\nbut a year or two later,people who win huge amounts of\nmoney don't report themselvesas any happier than people\naround them.And kind of amazingly--but I think it's deep\nabout life--accidents leading to\nquadriplegia or paraplegia,accidents that, before you had\nsuch an accident you wouldimagine that it would be\nsomething extremely difficult.And it can be in many ways.But by self report, ratings of\nhappiness return to typicalaverage populations\nof the same agein about three months.So what's a huge lesson here\nin happiness research--a huge surprise.It's two things.We're kind of bad at predicting\nwhat will make ushappy or sad, which is\nkind of weird, right?We're kind of bad at\npredicting it.Here's all these things where\nwe think they would make ushappy or make us not so happy.It

was\ndone in Canada--racism is widely condemned,\nas I think most of usbelieve it should be.But examples of blatant\nracism still occurred.One recent poll said that\nabout a third of whiteindividuals

have a plan of what\nthey're going to do.They're going to put on\na little show for you.But you don't know that.And the black male stands up and\nleaves the room to get hiscell phone, and he gently
