[{"text": "Hi.This is the first lecture\nin MIT's course 18.06,linear algebra, and\nI'm Gilbert Strang.The text for the\ncourse is this book,Introduction to Linear Algebra.And the course web page, which\nhas got a lot of exercises fromthe past, MatLab codes, the\nsyllabus for the course,is web.mit.edu/18.06.And this is the first\nlecture, lecture one.So, and later we'll give the\nweb address for viewing these,videotapes.Okay, so what's in\nthe first lecture?This is my plan.The fundamental problem\nof linear algebra,which is to solve a system\nof linear equations.So let's start\nwith a case when wehave some number of equations,\nsay n equations and n unknowns.So an equal number of\nequations and unknowns.That's the normal, nice case.And what I want to do is --\nwith examples, of course --to describe, first, what\nI call the Row picture.That's the picture of\none equation at a time.It's the picture you've\nseen before in twoby two equations\nwhere lines meet.So in a minute, you'll\nsee lines meeting.The second picture,\nI'll put a starbeside that, because that's\nsuch an important one.And maybe new to you is the\npicture -- a column at a time.", "start": 0.0, "heat":

example?The whole semester will be\nexamples and then see what'sgoing on with the example.So, take an example.Two equations, two unknowns.So let me take 2x\n-y =0, let's say.And -x 2y=3.Okay.let me -- I can even\nsay right away --what's the matrix, that is,\nwhat's the coefficient matrix?The matrix that involves\nthese numbers --a matrix is just a\nrectangular array of numbers.Here it's two rows and\ntwo columns, so 2 and --minus 1 in the first row minus\n1 and 2 in the second row,that's the matrix.And the right-hand\n-- the, unknown --well, we've got two unknowns.So we've got a vector, with\ntwo components, x and y,and we've got two right-hand\nsides that go into a vector0 3.I couldn't resist writing\nthe matrix form, right --even before the pictures.So I always will think\nof this as the matrix A,the matrix of coefficients,\nthen there's a vector ofunknowns.Here we've only\ngot two unknowns.Later we'll have any\nnumber of unknowns.And that vector of\nunknowns, well I'll often

solve this\nparticular exampleand then step back to\nsee the bigger picture.Okay, what's the picture for\nthis example, the Row picture?Okay, so here comes\nthe Row picture.So that means I take\none row at a timeand I'm drawing\nhere the xy planeand I'm going to plot\nall the points thatsatisfy that first equation.So I'm looking at all the\npoints that satisfy 2x-y =0.It's often good to start with\nwhich point on the horizontalline -- on this horizontal\nline, y is zero.The x axis has y as zero and\nthat -- in this case, actually,then x is zero.So the point, the origin --the point with coordinates\n(0,0) is on the line.It solves that equation.Okay, tell me in -- well,\nI guess I have to tell youanother point that solves\nthis same equation.Let me suppose x is one,\nso I'll take x to be one.Then y should be two, right?So there's the point one two\nthat also solves this equation.And I could put in more points.But, but let me put\nin all the pointsat once, because they all\nlie on a straight line.This is a linear equation\nand that word lineargot the lettersOkay, thanks. for line in it.That's the equation --\nthis is the line that ...of solutions to 2x-y=0 my\nfirst row, first

go through the origin.It's always important.Do we go through\nthe origin or not?In this case, yes, because\nthere's a zero over there.In this case we don't\ngo through the origin,because if x and y are\nzero, we don't get three.So, let me again say\nsuppose y is zero,what x do we actually get?If y is zero, then I\nget x is minus three.So if y is zero, I\ngo along minus three.So there's one point\non this second line.Now let me say, well,\nsuppose x is minus one --just to take another x.If x is minus one,\nthen this is a oneand I think y should be a one,\nbecause if x is minus one,then I think y should be a\none and we'll get that point.Is that right?If x is minus one, that's a one.If y is a one, that's\na two and the oneand the two make three and\nthat point's on the equation.Okay.Now, I should just\ndraw the line, right,connecting those\ntwo points at --that will give me\nthe whole line.And if I've done\nthis reasonably well,I think it's going to happen\nto go through -- well,not happen -- it was arranged\nto go through that point.So I think that the\nsecond line is this one,and this is the all-important\npoint that lies on both lines.Shall we just

2,\ntwo equations and two unknowns,it's the right place to start.Okay.So we've got the solution.The point that\nlies on both lines.Now can I come to\nthe column picture?Pay attention, this\nis the key point.So the column picture.I'm now going to look at\nthe columns of the matrix.I'm going to look at\nthis part and this part.I'm going to say that the\nx part is really x times --you see, I'm putting the two --I'm kind of getting the\ntwo equations at once --that part and then I have a\ny and in the first equationit's multiplying a minus one and\nin the second equation a two,and on the

makethose numbers the right\nnumbers to produce zero three.Okay.Now I want to draw a picture\nthat, represents what this --this is algebra.What's the geometry, what's\nthe picture that goes with it?Okay.So again, these vectors\nhave two components,so I better draw a\npicture like that.So can I put down these columns?I'll draw these\ncolumns as they are,and then I'll do a\ncombination of them.So the first column is over\ntwo and down one, right?So there's the first column.The first column.Column one.It's the vector two minus one.The second column is --minus one is the first\ncomponent

shall I take?Why not the right\ncombination, what the hell?Okay.So the combination\nI'm going to takeis the right one to\nproduce zero threeand then we'll see it\nhappen in the picture.So the right

it is, x is zero,\ny is three, that's b.That's the answer we wanted.And how do I do it?You see I do it just\nlike the first component.I have a two and a minus\ntwo that produces a zero,and in the

the combinations?If I took -- can I\ngo back to xs and ys?This is a question for really --it's going to come\nup over and over,but why don't we\nsee it once now?If I took all the xs and all\nthe ys,
