[{"text": "PROFESSOR: So as long\nas I'm introducingthe idea of a vector\nspace, I better introducethe things that go with it.The idea of its dimension\nand, all important, the ideaof a basis for that space.That space could be all of\nthree dimensional space,the space we live in.In that, case the\ndimension is three,but what's the meaning of\na basis-- a basis for threedimensional space.Or a basis for other spaces.OK, so I have to explain\nindependence, basis,and dimension.Dimension's easy if\nyou get the first two.OK, independence.Are those vectors independent?Well, if I draw them, in\nthree dimensional space,I can imagine 2, 1, 5\ngoing in some direction.Let me draw it.How's that?2, 1, 5, whatever!Goes there.That's a1.OK.Now is a2 on the same line?If a2 is on the same line\nthen it would be dependent.The two vectors\nwould be dependentif they're on the same line.But this one is\nnot on that line.A 4, 2, 0.So it doesn't go up and all.It's somewhere in\nthis plane, 4, 2, 0.I'll say there.Whatever.a2.So those are independent.So their combinations\ngive me a space.The combinations of a1 and a2\ngive me a plane, a flat plane,in three dimensional space.That plane is, I would\nsay, they span the plane.a1 and a2 span a plane.And here's the key word: span.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.159}, {"text": "So there are two vectors.They're in three\ndimensional space.And the plane they span\nis all their combinations.That's what we're always doing:\ntaking all the combinationsof these vectors.OK.So there-- and actually, a1 and\na2 are a basis for that pane.a1 and a2 are a\nbasis for that planebecause their combinations\nfill the plane.And also, they're independent.I need them both.If I threw away one, I would\nonly have one vector left,and it would only span a line.OK.Now let me bring in a third\nvector in three dimensions.Well, what shall I take\nfor that third vector?Ha!Suppose I take a1 plus\na2 as my third vector.So 6, 3, 5.What about the vector 6, 3, 5?Well, what do I know?It's obviously special.It's a1 plus a2.It's in the same plane.So if I took a3 equal 6, 3,\n5, that would be dependent.The three vectors would\nbe dependent with that a3.They would span the plane still.Their combinations would\nstill give the plane,but they wouldn't be\na basis for the plane.a1 and 12 and a3 together,\nthat's too much, too manyvectors for a single plane.The vectors are dependent.And we don't-- a basis has\nto be independent vectors.You have to need them all.We don't need all three here.So that's a dependent one.It can't go into a\nbasis with a1 and a2because the three\nvectors are dependent.Now let me make a\ndifference choice.So that one's dead.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.117}, {"text": "That did not do it.All right.Let me take a3\nequal to some other,not a combination of\nthese, but headed offin some new direction.Well, I don't know what\nthat new direction is.Maybe 1, 0, 0.What the heck?I believe-- I hope I'm\nright-- that 1, 0, 0is not a combination here.I say 1, 0, 0 goes off.It's pretty short.Here's a3.Better a3 then\nthat loser 6, 3, 5.1 0, 0 is a winner.These three vectors--So now a1, a2, and let me\nadd in a3, all three of themspan a-- what do they span?What are all the\ncombinations of a1, a2, a3?It's three dimensional?It's the whole three\ndimensional space.They span all of 3D, the\nwhole three dimensional space.They're a basis for the whole\nthree dimensional space.They're independent.So let me-- you see that\npicture before I move it?a1, a2, a3 are independent.None of them is a\ncombination of the others.They fill a three\ndimensional space.They're are a basis for that\nthree dimensional space.And that space is,\nin this example,is the whole of our three.So let me just write down on\nthe next blackboard what I mean.Independent.Independent.So independent\ncolumns of a matrix.Independent columns of a matrix\nA means the only solution to Av", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "equals 0 is v equals 0.So if I have\nindependent columns,then I haven't got\nany null space.If I have independent\ncolumns, then the null spaceof the matrix is\njust the 0 vector.So let me write down\nthat example again.A was the matrix 2, 1,\n5, 4, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0.So I believe that matrix\nhas independent columns.So its column space is the\nfull three dimensional space.It's null space\nonly contains-- letme put it, make that clear\nthat that's a vector.And now I'm ready to write\ndown the idea of a basis.So what is a basis\nfor the space?A basis for a space, a subspace.Independent vectors.That's the key.Independent vectors that\nspan the space, the subspace.Whatever it is.By the way, if the\ncolumn space is alla three dimensional space, as it\nis here, that's a subspace too.It's the whole space,\nbut the whole spacecounts as a subspace of itself.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And the 0 vector alone counts\nas the smallest possible.So if we're in three dimensions,\nthe idea of subspaceshas-- we have just the 0 vector.Just one point.That's a smallest.We have the whole three\ndimensional space.That's the biggest.And then we have all\nthe lines through 0.Those are on the small side.We have all the\nplanes through 0.Those are a bit bigger.And those dimensions\nare 0, 1, 2, 3.The possible dimensions\nis told to usby how many basis\nvectors we need.So let me look at that and\nthen come to dimension.OK.So independent means\nthat the only--that no combination,\nno other combinationof the vectors, no\ncombination of these vectorsgives the 0 vector except to\ntake 0 of that, 0 of that,and 0 of that.So those are a basis\nfor the column spacebecause they're independent\nand their combinationsgive the whole column space.OK.And now I wanted to say\nsomething about dimensions.OK.Dimension.It's a number.It's the number of basis\nvectors for the subspace.Oh!But you might say,\nthat the subspacehas other bases,\nnot just the one youhappen to think of first.",

vectors.Any three.But the point is, the\npoint about dimensionis that I need exactly three.I can never get two vectors\nthat span all of our three.And I can never get\nfour vectors thatare independent in our three.If I have fewer than\nthe dimension number,I don't have enough.They don't span.If I have too many, than the\ndimension, they're dependent.They won't be independent.They can't be a basis.Every basis has the same number.And that number is the\ndimension of the subspace.All right, let's just take an\nexample, just with a picture.I'll stay in three\ndimensional space,but my subspace will\njust be a plane.So here I'm in three\ndimensional space.Good.Now I have my\nsubspace is a plane.So it goes through the\norigin, but it's only a plane.So I'm expecting that I could\ntake a vector in the plane,and I could take another\nvector in the plane,and they could be independent.They are.They're different directions.I couldn't find a third\nindependent vectorin the plane.Every
