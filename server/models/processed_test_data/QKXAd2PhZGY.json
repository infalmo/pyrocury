[{"text": "JOEL LEWIS: Hi, welcome\nback to recitation.In lecture,\nProfessor Jerison wasteaching about L'Hospital's\nRule, and one thingthat he mentioned\nseveral times wasthat when you apply\nL'Hospital's Rule,it's really important that the\nsecond limit exists in orderfor L'Hospital's\nRule to be true,in order for the first limit\nto equal the second limit.So I have a-- but\nhe didn't give youany examples of\nwhat can go wrong.So I have here a limit\nfor you to work on.So what I'd like you to do\nis try L'Hospital's Rule,see what happens, and then try\nto solve it a different way notusing L'Hospital's Rule.So why don't you\npause the video,spend a couple minutes\nworking on that, come back,and we can work on it together.Welcome back.Hopefully you've have some\nfun working on this limit.Let's go through it\nand see what happenswhen we try to apply\nL'Hospital's Rule to it.So the first thing to notice\nis that as x goes to infinity,x plus cosine x-- well,\ncosine x is small,and you know, between minus 1\nand 1-- x is going to infinity.So the top is going to\ninfinity and the bottomis going to infinity.So this is an infinity over\ninfinity indeterminate form.So it is a context\nin which we cantry to apply L'Hospital's\nRule, so that's fine.So it's an\nindeterminate ratio, wecan look at applying\nL'Hospital's Rule.So let's try to do that.So L'Hospital's Rule\nsays that the limitas x goes to infinity\nof our expression x pluscosine x divided by\nx is equal-- and I'mgoing to put a little question\nmark here because whatL'Hospital's Rule says is\nthat it's equal provided--it's equal to what I'm\ngoing to write over here,provided that the\nsecond limit exists.So what goes over here?Well it's the limit as x goes\nto the same place, as x goes", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.147}, {"text": "to infinity, of the\nratio of the derivative,so the derivative of the top\ndivided by the derivativeof the bottom.So in this case\nthat's 1 minus sinex is the derivative\nof the top and 1 isthe derivative of the bottom.OK, now let's look\nat this limit.What happens?Well, OK the over 1\npart is irrelevant.The 1 minus part, OK, who cares?The only thing that's changing\nin this limit is the sine x.So as x goes to infinity what\nthis does is it oscillates,just like sine x does.I mean, it's offset\nand flipped upside downbecause of this 1 minus.So, in particular, you\nknow, sometimes it's near 1,sometimes it's near negative\n1, sometimes it's near 0,and it oscillates back\nand forth in between.So in particular,\nbecause it's oscillating,it's not approaching any value.So this limit doesn't exist.It's not equal to\nany real number.It's not equal to infinity.It's not equal to\nminus infinity.It does not exist.OK, so the statement\nof L'Hospital's theoremsays that this equality\nis really wrong.OK?What it means is that\nL'Hospital's Ruletells you nothing.You don't learn anything here.So if we want to compute\nthis first limit,we can't use L'Hospital's Rule.We have to come up with some\nbetter way to do it, OK.So that's what's going wrong.Now let's see about\ndoing this eventhough we don't have this tool.So if we try and\nsolve this limitwithout L'Hospital's Rule, so\nwe want to look at the limitas x goes to infinity of x\nplus cosine x divided by x.Well, think about what's\nimportant in this limit.As x is getting big, well\nx is getting big and xis getting big and\nwhat's cosine x doing?Well cosine x is behaving\nlike a constant but wigglier,right, we could say.So cosine x is always\nbetween minus 1 and 1,but, you know, it's\noscillating, but it'sin some bounded interval\nthere, whereas x and x are both", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.112}, {"text": "going to infinity at\nexactly the same speed,so this suggests a manipulation\nthat sort of allowsus to quantify that explicitly.And so one thing\nthat we can do iswe can divide top and\nbottom of this limit by x.So if we do that, or\nequivalently we can justdivide this x into\nthe fraction above,split it into two fractions.So we have-- I'm just going\nto re-write it one moretime-- the limit as x goes\nto infinity of x plus cosinex divided by x is\nequal to the limitas x goes to infinity of\n1 plus cosine x over x.All right, so what's\nhappening here?Well, all I've done is I've\ndivided that x in-- and now yousee that this 1, that was\nfrom the x over x, so that'sa constant that's going to 1.And as x goes to\ninfinity, cosine x-- againwe can think of it like\na constant but wigglier--x is going to\ninfinity, so cosinex over x is going to 0\nas x goes to infinity.So I guess I wouldn't\ncall this plugging in,but it's, you know, sort\nof just like plugging in.So this part is going to 0,\nso we're left with just 1.OK, so we can evaluate\nthis limit fairly easily.It just took a couple steps.But we can't evaluate it\nwith L'Hospital's Rule.So this is why you have that\nextra thing in the statementof the theorem that Professor\nJerison kept saying,and that I'll say\nevery time I use it,which is L'Hospital's Rule says\nthat the limit of the ratiois equal to the limit of\nthe ratio of the derivativeprovided the second\nlimit exists.OK, so here's an example where\nthe second limit didn't existand so we can't say that\nthe two are actuallyequal to each other, and we need\nsome other tools to evaluatethe limit in question.So I'll end there.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.214}]
