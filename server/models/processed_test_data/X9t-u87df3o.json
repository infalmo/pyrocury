[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Hi, I'm Gilbert\nStrang, and I'm a mathprofessor at MIT.And I hope these highlights of\ncalculus will be helpful.I started the project this\nyear, because the linearalgebra lectures which were in\nclass have been watched by alot of people on\nOpenCourseWare.And so I looked at what there\nwas for calculus.And I saw two or three\ntypes of things.One was lectures, sort of\nvery serious, too mathy.And another was supported by\nfoundations, an effort to makemath look so terrifically\nexciting and wonderful andconnect with everything.And yet, I feel a lot of\npeople are taking mathcourses, calculus, in high\nschool, in college, and simplywant a little help to see\nwhat's the main point.And maybe that's the idea of\nthese lectures, is to try totell you the main point without\nall the heavy thingsthat a giant textbook would\ndo, and without all thepractice that you'll get\nin class, and doingexercises and so on.So these are kind of short,\nbut I hope alive.And if they help,\nI'm very happy.So I guess I'm hoping everybody\nmight watch this", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.393}, {"text": "who'd like a little help or a\nsecond look at calculus, bothhigh school and college\nstudents.I wanted to capture key ideas\nthat you could use for reviewand see new examples\nand see just comingfrom a second person.That seems to be what succeeds\nwith linear algebra.The videos are sort of just to\nadd, to supplement what you'reactually seeing in class\nand in the textbook.I think of the textbooks as\noften so large and so manyexercises that it's totally easy\nto lose the key point,what's essential about calculus\nand what is just kindof routine and practice.So in short videos, it has to\nbe the essential points, thethree groups of functions, like\npowers of x, sine andcosine of x, and e to the x.If you understand those, you've\ngot the main ideas.We're starting out with a first\ngroup of five videos.Maybe big picture is the words\nthat we think of for those.And then that'll be the first\ngroup that'll be onOpenCourseWare.And then I've done 12 after\nthat, that do sort of the restof differential calculus, big\nwords just meaning how to findthe derivative, the\nslope, the speed.You'll see in the videos.And then after that could come\nintegral calculus, if youthink I should.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.322}, {"text": "I don't think of a lot ofprerequisites for these videos.I guess I'm always hopeful that\nyou could watch them evenif you haven't started calculus,\nto see what'scoming, what it's about.I've taught math for a long\ntime, and it's so easy to getinto the course and jump over\nthe opening, the introductionthat tells what's\nimportant here.And that's maybe what these\nvideos are aimed at.FEMALE SPEAKER: This has been\na production of MITOpenCourseWare and\nGilbert Strang.Funding for this video was\nprovided by the LordFoundation.To help OCW continue to provide\nfree and open accessto MIT courses, please\nmake a donation atocw.mit.edu/donate.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.393}]
