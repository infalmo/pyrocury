so far.And thank you for\nfilling out the survey.So we got some very useful\nand interesting feedbacks.One of the feedbacks--\nthis is my impression,I haven't gotten a chance\nto talk to my co-lecturersor colleagues yet, but\nI read some comments.You were saying that some of\nthe problem sets are quite hard.The math part may be a bit more\ndifficult than the lecture.So I'm thinking.So this is really the\napplication lecture.And from now, after three\nmore lectures by Choongbum,it will be essentially the\nremainder is all applications.The original point\nof having this classis really to show you\nhow math is applied,to show you those cases\nin different markets,different strategies,\nand in the real industry.So I'm trying to think, how\ndo I give today's lecturewith the right balance?This is, after\nall, a math class.Should I give you more math,\nor should I-- you've had enoughmath.I mean, it sounded\nlike from the surveyyou probably had enough math.So I would probably\nwant to focus a bit moreon the application side.And from the survey also\nit seems like most of youenjoyed or wanted to listen to\nmore on the application side.So anyway, as you've already\nlearned from Peter's lecture,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.474}, {"text": "the so-called Modern\nPortfolio Theory.And it's actually\nnot that modernanymore, but we still call\nit Modern

that,both in the past,\na different area,and today probably more\nfocused on the buy side.Oh, come on in.Yeah.Actually, these\nare my colleaguesfrom Harvard Management.So--[CHUCKLES]--they will be able to ask\nme really tough questions.So anyway, so how I'm\ngoing to start this class.You wondered why I handed\nout to each of you a page.So does everyone have\na blank page by now?Yeah, actually.Yeah.Could also pass to--?Yeah.So I want every one of\nyou to use that blank pageto construct a portfolio, OK?So you're saying, well, I\nhaven't done this before.That's fine.Do it totally from\nyour intuition,from your knowledge\nbase as of now.So what I want you to\ndo is to write down,to break down the\n100% of what do youwant to have in your portfolio.OK, you said, give me choices.No, I'm not going\nto give you choices.You think about whatever\nyou like to put down.Wide open, OK?And don't even ask me\nthe goal or the criteria.Base it on what you want to do.And so totally free\nthinking, but I wantyou to do it in five minutes.So don't overthink it.And hand it back to me, OK?So that's really the first part.I want you to show\nintuitively how youcan construct a

$1,000, or you\ncould be a portfolio managerand have hundreds of billions\nof dollars, or whatever.Or then and say if they raise\nsome money, start a hedge fund,they may have $10,000\njust to start with.How do you want to use\nthose money on day one?Just think about it.And then so while you're\nfilling out those pages,please hand it back to me.It's your choice to put\nyour name down or not.And then I will start\nto assemble those ideasand put them on the blackboard.And sometimes I may come back\nto ask you a question-- youknow, why did you put this?That's OK.Don't feel embarrassed.We're not going to\nput you on the spot.But the idea is I want to use\nthose examples to show youhow we actually connect\ntheory with practice.I remember when I was a\ncollege student I learneda lot of different stuff.But I remember one\nlecture so well,one teacher told me one thing.I still remember vividly well,\nso I want to pass it on to you.So how do we learn\nsomething useful, right?You always

predictions,and find your error.Then this feeds\nback to this rule.And a lot of times, the\nverification processis really about\nunderstanding special cases.That's why today I really want\nto illustrate the portfoliotheory using a lot\nof special cases.So can you start to hand back\nyour portfolio constructionby now?OK, so just hand back\nwhatever you have.If you have one thing on\nthe paper, that's fine.Or many things on\nthe paper, or youthink as a portfolio manager,\nor you think as a trader,or you think simply as\na student, as yourself.All right, so I'm\ngetting these back.I

How do\nyou do it, really?What's the criteria?And so before we\nanswer the question howyou do, how do you group\nassets or exposuresor strategies or even people,\ntraders, together-- before weask all those questions,\nwe have to askourselves another question.What is the goal?What is the objective, right?So we understand what\nportfolio management is.So here in this class,\nwe're not talkingabout how to come up with\na specific winning strategyin trading or investments.But we are talking about\nhow to put them together.So this is what portfolio\nmanagement is about.So before we answer\nhow, let's see why.Why do we do it?Why do we want to have\na portfolio, right?That's a very, very good point.So let's understand the goals\nof portfolio management.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.358}, {"text": "So before we understand goals\nof portfolio management,let's understand\nyour situations,everyone's situation.So let's look at this chart.So I'm going to\nplot your spendingas a function of your age.So when you are\nage 0 to age 100,so everyone's spending\npattern is different.So I'm not going to tell you\nthis is the spending pattern.So obviously when\nkids are young,they probably don't have a\nlot of hobbies or tuition,but they have some basic needs.So they spend.And then the spending\nreally goes up.Now your parents have\nto pay your tuition,or you have to borrow--\nloans, scholarships.And then you have college.Now you have-- you're married.You have kids.You need to buy a house, buy\na car, pay back student loans.You have a lot more spending.Then you go on vacation.You buy investments.You just have more\nspending coming up.So but it goes to\na certain point.You will taper down, right?So you're not going\nto keep going forever.So that's your spending curve.And with the other curve,\nyou think about it.It's what's your income,\nwhat's your earnings curve.You don't earn anything\nwhere you are just born.I use earning.So this is spending.So let's call this 50.Your earning probably\ntypically peaks around age 50,", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "but it really depends.Then you probably\ngo down, back up.Right, so that's your earning.And do they always match well?They don't.So how do you make\nup the difference?You hope to have a fund,\nan investment on the side,which can generate those cash\nflows to balance your earningversus your spending.OK, so that's only one\nsimple way to put it.So you've got to ask\nabout your situation.What's your cash flow look like?So my objective is, I'm\ngoing to retire at age of 50.Then after the age of\n50, I will live free.I'll travel around the world.Now I'll calculate\nhow much money I need.So that's one situation.The other situation is, I want\nto graduate and pay back allthe student loans in one year.So that's another.And typically people\nhave to plan these out.And if I'm managing a\nuniversity endowment,so I have to think about what\nthe university's operatingbudget is like, how much money\nthey need every year drawingfrom this fund.And then by\nmaintaining, protectingthe total fund for basically\na perpetual purpose, right?Ongoing and keep growing it.You ask for more contributions,\nbut at the same time generatingmore return.If you have a pension\nfund, you haveto think about what time frame\nlot of the people, the workers,will retire and will actually\ndraw from the pension.And so every situation\nis very different.Let me even expand it.So you think, oh, this\nis all about investment.No, no, this is not\njust about investment.So I was a trader for a\nlong time at Morgan Stanley,and later on a trading manager.So when I had many\ntraders working for me,", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "the question I was\nfacing is how much moneyI need to allocate to each\ntrader to let them trade.How much risk do\nthey take, right?So they said, oh, I have\nthis winning strategy.I can make lots of money.Why don't you give\nme more limits?No, you're not going\nto have all the limits.You're not going to have all\nthe capital we can give to you.Right, so I'm going to explain.You have to diversify.At the same time, you have\nto compare the strategieswith parameters--\nliquidity, volatility,and many other parameters.And even if you are\nnot managing people,let's say-- I was going to\ndo this, so Dan, [INAUDIBLE],Martin and Andrew.So they start a\nhedge fund together.So each of them had\na great strategy.Dan has five, Andrew has\nfour, so they altogetherhave 30 strategies.So they raise an\namount of money,or they just pool\ntogether their savings.But how do you\ndecide which strategyto put more money on day one?So those questions\nare very practical.So that's all.So you understand\nyour goals, that'sthen you're really clear on\nhow much risk you can take.So let's come back to that.So what is risk?As Peter explained\nin his lecture,risk is actually not\nvery well defined.So in the Modern\nPortfolio Theory,we typically talk about\nvariance or standard deviationof return.So today I'm going to\nstart with that concept,but then try to\nexpand it beyond that.So stay with that\nconcept for now.Risk, we use standard\ndeviation for now.So what are we trying to do?", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.101}, {"text": "So this, you are familiar\nwith this chart, right?So return versus\nstandard deviation.Standard deviation is\nnot going to go negative.So we stop at zero.But the return\ncan go below zero.And I'm going to review one\nformula before I go into it.I think it's useful to review\nwhat previously you learned.So you let's say you\nhave-- I will alsoclarify the notation as well\nso you don't get confused.So let's say-- so Peter\nmentioned the Harry MarkowitzModern Portfolio Theory\nwhich won him the NobelPrize in 1990, right?Along with Sharpe\nand a few others.So it's a very\nelegant piece of work.But today, I will try to\ngive you some special casesto help you understand that.So let's review\none of the formulashere, which is really\nthe definition.So let's say you\nhave a portfolio.Let's call the expected\nreturn of the portfoliois R of P, equal to the\nsum, a weighted sum,of all the expected\nreturns of each asset.You'll basically\nlinearly allocate them.Then the variance-- oh, let's\njust look at the variance,sigma_P squared.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So these

just collected back to put\nyour choice of the investmenton this chart.OK, so let's start with one.So what is cash?Cash has no standard deviation.You hold cash-- so it's\ngoing to be on this axis.It's a positive return.So that's here.So let's call this cash.Where is-- and let's me just\nthink about another example.Where's lottery?Say you buy Powerball, right?So where's lottery falling?Let's assume you put\neverything in lottery.So you're going to lose.So your expected value is\nvery close to lose 100%.And your standard deviation\nis probably very close to 0.So you will be here.So some of you say, oh, no, no.It's not exactly zero.So OK, fine.So maybe it's\nsomewhere here, OK?So not 100%, but you still\nhave a pretty small deviationfrom losing all the money.What is coin flipping?So let's say you decide to\nput all your money to gambleon a fair coin flip, fair coin.So expected return is zero.What is the standard\ndeviation of that?AUDIENCE: 100%?PROFESSOR: Good.So 100%.", "start":

with some volatility.Let's call it here.What is investing in a start\nup venture capital fund like?Pretty up there, right?So you'll probably get\na very high return,by you can lose all your money.So probably somewhere\nhere, you see.Buying stocks, let's\ncall it somewhere here.Our last application\nlecture, youheard about investing\nin commodities, right?Trading gold, oil.So that has higher volatility,\nso sometimes high returns.So let's call this commodity.And the ETF is typically lower\nthan single stock volatility,because it's just\nlike index funds.So here.Are there any other choices\nyou'd like to put on this map?OK.So let me just look at\nwhat you came up with.Real estate, OK.Real estate, I would say\nprobably somewhere around here.Private equity probably\nsomewhere

standard deviation, right?I hesitate to use\nthe term \"risk,\" OK?Because as I said, we\nneed to better define it.But let's just say you\ntry to minimize thisbut maximize this,\nthe vertical axis.OK,

two.But for this, that's\nactually all possible, right?So then that's where we learn\nabout the efficient frontier?So what is the\nefficient frontier?It's really the\npossible combinationsof those investments you\ncan push out to the boundarythat you can no longer find\nanother combination-- giventhe same standard\ndeviation, you can no longerfind a higher return.So you reached the boundary.And

going to ignorewhat's below this now, right?We don't want to be there.And we want to stay\non the up-right.So let's consider\none special case.So again for that, let's\nwrite out for the two assets.So what is R of P?It's w_1 R_1 plus 1\nminus w_1 R_2, right?Very simple math.And what is sigma_P?So the standard deviation of\nthe portfolio-- or the varianceof that, which is a\nsquare-- we know

line.So here is when\nweight one equal to 0.So you weight everything\non the second asset.Here you weight the\nfirst asset 100%.So you have a possible\ncombination along this line,along this flat

combination.So the two-asset examples seem\nto be quite easy and simple,but actually it's a very\nimportant one to compare.And that will lead me to\nget into the risk paritydiscussion.But before I get

risk-adjusted return.And how many of you have\nheard of Kelly's formula?So Kelly's formula\nbasically gives youthat when you have-- let's\nsay in the gambling example,you know your

you\nconstruct a portfolio,this leads to the next question.It's in addition to the\nefficient frontier discussion,is that really all\nabout asset allocation?Is that how we calculate\nour weights of
