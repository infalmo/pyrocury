[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.Welcome back.So today we'd like to tackle\na problem in Fourier series.And specifically, we're just\ngoing to compute the Fourierseries for a simple function.So the function we're interested\nin is f of t, which we're toldis periodic with period 2pi--\nf of t is 1 from minus pi to 0,and then it's minus\n1 from 0 to pi.So first off, we're interested\nin sketching f of t.Secondly, we'd like to compute\nthe Fourier series for f of t.And then thirdly, we'd like to\nsketch the first non-zero termof the Fourier series.And we can specifically\nsketch this single termon top of f of t.So I'll let you think\nabout this problem for now,and I'll be back in a moment.Hi, everyone.Welcome back.So let's take a look\nat sketching f of t.So for part a, we\nhave our axes, t.And we're told f of t\nwithin some interval.So we might as well plot\nf of t on that interval.So minus pi, pi and\n0, we know that f of tis 1 from minus pi to 0.We're also told that it's\nminus 1 from 0 to pi.And now to fill in the blanks\nor to complete the picture of f,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "we're told that it\nhas a period of 2pi.So note that\nthey've told us whatf looks like over\nthe range of minus pito pi, which is\nthe length of 2pi.So basically what we can do\nis we can use this as a stampand just pick up\nthis entire picture,shift it over one\nperiod 2pi, and justthinking of this picture in\nstamping it in multiple places.So just filling\nthis in it's goingto look like a square wave,\nwhich jumps between minus 1and 1 at every multiple of pi.So this concludes part a.For part b, which is the\nreal meat of the problem,we're interested in computing\na Fourier series for f of t.Now, we can always write\ndown a Fourier seriesfor any periodic function.And specifically in\nthis case, for part b,the periodic function we're\ninterested in has period 2pi.So for the class\nnotes, we've identifiedL with half the period.So in this case,\nL is 2pi dividedby 2, which gives us pi.And just to recall what a\nFourier series is, what we dois we try and take\nour function f of tand write it down as a\nsummation of sines and cosines.So in this case for function\nf of t, which is 2pi periodic,it's going to look\nsomething like this.It's going to a of 0 plus\nsum from n equals 1--and there's going to be\ninfinitely many terms,but in this case we have a\nof n times cosine of n*t.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And it's n*t here because\nwe have period 2pi.Plus b_n sine n_t.So this is the general form.And when asked to compute the\nFourier series of a function,the main difficulty is to\ncompute these coefficients a_nand b_n.However, that\nessentially boils downto working out some integrals.So let's take a look\nat what a of 0 is.So the formula for a_0 is 1\nover 2L-- so in this case,it's 1 over 2pi--\ntimes the integralover 1 period of the\nfunction, from minus pi to pi,of just f of t.So notice how a_0 is just\nthe average of the function.So if we take a look at\nthe function f of t, f of tspends exactly half of its\ntime at 1 and half of its timeat minus 1.So immediately we could\nguess that the average valueof f of t is going to be 0.If you wanted to work\nit out specifically,we would have 1 over 2pi\nminus pi to 0, f of ttakes on the value of plus 1.And then from 0 to pi, f of t\ntakes on the value of minus 1.So we would end up getting\npi minus pi, which is 0.For a_n, the formula is\n1 over half the period.So note how a of 0 is\njust a special case.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "We always have the full period\nin a_0, but in a_n and b_n,the factor that divides the\nintegral is always going to behalf the period times minus pi\nto pi, f of t cosine n*t dt.And I should point out\nthat, in general, we onlyneed to integrate over one\nperiod of the function.So in some sense there's nothing\nspecial about minus pi and pi.It's just very often\nthese are the easiestbounds of integration\nto integrate over.But in practice, we\ncould have used 0to 2pi or any other interval,\nas long as it's exactlyone period of the function.So in this case, I'd\njust like to take a lookat the symmetry of f of t.And we note that\nthe function f of tis actually odd\nabout the origin.So if f of t is odd and cosine\nt is an even function, thenan odd times an even function\nis going to be an odd function.And when you integrate an odd\nfunction from minus any valueto the same positive value, so\nin this case minus pi to pi,we always get 0.So this is actually\n0, because we'reintegrating an odd function\nover a symmetric interval.So lastly, we have the values\nof b_n, which are 1 over pi,minus pi to pi, f\nof t of sine n*t dt.And if we were to look at just\nthe symmetry argument

symmetric bound,\nyou will essentiallyget twice the value\nof the integralfrom 0 to one of the bounds.So b of n in this\ncase doesn't vanish,which means we actually\nhave to do some work.So what we do?Well, we know the value of\nf of t on two intervals,so we're just going to have\nto work out each interval.Minus pi to 0, it takes\non the value of 1.So we have sine n*t.And then from 0 to pi, f of t\ntakes on the value of minus 1,sine n*t dt.And you'll note that these\nintegrals are actuallythe same.So this is negative 2 over\npi, zero to pi, sine n*t dt,which if we integrate is\nnegative 1

cosine n*pi,we see that cosine n*pi\noscillates between minus 1", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and 1.So cosine of pi is negative\n1, cosine of 2pi is 1,cosine of 3pi is minus 1.Dot, dot,

what\npattern emerges in the b's.So b of 1, if I plug in 1,\nI get 1 minus negative 1.It's going to be 2.So I get minus 4 over pi.b of 2 is going to be 1 minus\nminus 1 squared is just 1.So this

that\nhas exactly period 2pi,and it's going to line up\nexactly with this square wave.In addition, minus 4 over pi\nis just slightly larger than 1.So we're going to\nend up with sin,which peaks just slightly\nabove 1 and slightly below 1.It's going to go\nthrough 0, and it'sgoing to go through\neach multiple of pi.So it might look\nsomething like this.So this is the first\nFourier term in the
