actuallytalking about poker strategy, so\nthis should be pretty exciting.So the first thing we're going\nto learn about is position,and this is only\nthree slides long.So positions have\ndifferent names.They're put in two\ndifferent groups,and a lot of how\nwe describe what'sgoing in a particular\nhand is goingto be relevant to where\npeople are sitting.Why?Because people in\na late positionget to act after people\nin an early position.And in general, the\npositions are brokeninto four different groups.There are the blinds,\nwho pay the blindsand are first act on every\nstreet after a pre-flop.There's early position,\nmiddle position,and late position, where all\nthese positions have names,except middle position.Starting in the big blind,\nwe call it under the gun,under the gun plus 1,\nunder the gun plus 2.You could also describe\nthese as seat 1, 2, 3, 4all the way to 9 or 10,\nalthough I don't reallylike that because I they all\nhave pretty unique names,and they're descriptive\nenough to just use those.So middle position is labeled\none, two, and three, and thenaround the button you\ndescribe their relationto the button, where\neither you are the buttonor you are cutting\noff the button.And then some people get a\nlittle crazy by calling thisthe hijack, but I\ntend to not do that,and then as we\neliminate people, weget rid of the least\ninteresting positionsto only keep the\nones with real names.So the reason that I'm\ntelling you this nowis we're going to be\ngoing through hands", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.117}, {"text": "where I talk about\nplayers by their position.The individual person\ndoesn't matter,but it's much to\nunderstand what'sgoing on when I refer to them\nas a cut off, or the button,or whatever.But in general,\nthe later positionis better because you\nget more information.You get to see people\nacting before you.And as a result, the\nmoney flows, in general,to the late positions.The hand that you're\nthe button, you'regoing to make the\nmost amount of money,and you can see that\nin poker tracker.And if you're losing\nmoney on the button,you should seriously\nreevaluate howyou're playing that,\nbecause that's when youmake the most amount of money.Big blinds are an\ninteresting situationbecause they get to see\nthe flop for a discount,because they're compelled\nto pay some sort of bet.So you might think the\nblinds are in a good positionbecause they get a free\nflop, but they're actuallyin a terrible position because\nwhen position matters post flopthey are the first to act\nin every single situation.So even though you\nmight think that you'regetting a discount for\nbeing in the blinds,you're getting a\ndiscount and entryinto a hand where you're\nalmost certainly goingto be at a major\ninformational disadvantage.However, interestingly,\nin short stack situations,early position is\nactually betterbecause you have the\nopportunity to goall in before the\nother person does,and you maintain the equity from\naggression, the fold equity,which we'll talk about later.It's sort of like a\ngame of chicken where--so chicken is a game where\ntwo people drive at each otheruntil one person turns, where\nit's like the an infinitely badreturn if they both don't turn,\nand then one wins if one turnsand one doesn't.So the proper\nstrategy in chickenis to throw your steering\nwheel out the windowso the other person\nknows he only", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.151}, {"text": "has one option if he doesn't\nwant an infinitely big loss.So with position, it works\nvery similar to that,where if you're in a tournament\nwhere neither person wantsto see a showdown,\nneither person wantsto deal with a coin flip\nfor their tournament life,if you're in early position,\nyou have the opportunityto be the aggressor\nand go all in.So you get to discourage\nthe other personfrom entering into it.So let's move on to\nsome basic concepts.So a lot of these things\nare based on odds.So poker is a statistical\ngame, and we'regoing to be talking about\napplications of math to poker.So why does drawing matter?So drawing means you're\ntrying to make a hand.More cards that will\ncome out will give youa really good hand, whereas\nyou don't necessarilyhave a good hand right now.In a really common\nsituation, there'sone guy that has an\nOK hand, and there'sone guy that has nothing\nbut the potentialto have a really good hand.Most of the decision\npoints come downto whether the guy with\nnothing has equity,has an interest in\nmaking his real hand.So really common\nexamples of theseare one person has\na pair or two pair,and one guy has a\nstraight or a flush draw.If we're talking pre-flop,\nsomeone has a pocket pair,and someone else has\nliterally anything else,and they're trying to make\nanything more than whateverthat guy's pairs is.So what the drawer\nhas to to-- the guywithout a real hand-- is\nto decide whether the bethe is facing or whatever\nhas to pay to see more cardsto find out if he makes\nhis hand is worth the cost,is worth what the\naggressor is making him payto see that additional card.And the person who has a\nhand already wants to make itso that the drawer cannot see\nhis card for a positive equity.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.153}, {"text": "He wants to bet so much that\na call is bad, because that'swhere his equity comes from.So he can either bet enough so\nthat he folds-- the other guyfolds-- or bet enough that he'll\ncall and make a huge mistake.Both are equally good.Actually the second\nis probably better.AUDIENCE: You're\nsaying [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: So I'm saying\na drawer is someonewho has a flush draw\nor a straight draw,or basically has no\nreal hand at showdown,but has a reasonable chance\nof, as more cards come out,making a monster hand, like\nmaking a hand which will almostcertainly win that showdown.OK, so let's go\nthrough a scenario.OK, so this seems\npretty straightforward.There's some sort\nof bet pre-flop.I called, and it was heads up.It came with four to a flush,\nfour hearts, and this guy betinto me.And the question\nis, what do we do?That's a big question.And I'm going to be\nusing this format a lotbecause it's easier\nto-- at least for me,it's easier to see, and then\nhopefully it's somethingyou guys will pick up on.I'm only going to include\nrelevant information,and the cases are\ngoing to be writtenthis format where we have\nthe relevant stacks up here.Here are the blinds.This means that small blind\nis $20, big blind is $40,and there's a $10 ante.This is a pot before\nanyone does anything.This is a pot as of a flop.These are my cards.The hero is whoever\nwe care about.The villain is the other guy.And this just shows the\norder of what happens.So here he raised\nto $120 pre-flop.Three big blinds.I call.The flop comes eight of\nhearts, three of hearts,something that doesn't matter.He bets $370, all in.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So my decision is,\nwhat can I do here?And this is a really\ncommon scenario.And what we can do\nis develop the toolsthat we need to make\nthis-- to figure outwhat we want to do here.And rather than\nshould we call, wecan come up with a much\nmore resilient answer.What's the biggest\nbet that we can call?And we're going to\nend up with a solutionset of this, of this area here.That's what we\nwant to figure out.But first we need\nto develop somethingcalled expected value.So expected value is the same\nin poker as it is in math.It's just a probability\nweighted averageof all possible results.So it's win percentage\ntimes win amount minuslose percentage\ntimes lose amount.So in our scenario, we're going\nto add some variables into it.We're facing about\ninto a pot of 380.Our EV is going to\nbe whatever chancewe have to win times a pot of\n380 plus whatever the be is,x, minus our lose percentage,\nwhich is 1 minus win percentagetimes that same variable x.And our threshold for\ncall is when EV equals 0.So pot odds is generally\nwhat we call the relationshipbetween the size of\nthe bet you're facingand the pot that you would\nwin if you call that betand then win the hand.So this is going\nto be the equation.So it's plus EV.It's positive expectation if\nthe chance you have of winningis greater than the call amount\ndivided by the size of the potafter the call.So say that we're\nseeing a bet of $100.We were seeing a bet a little\nbit bigger than that, but justfor example purposes,\nwe'll use $100.So your pot odds\nwould be $100 dividedby $580, where $580 is\nwhatever was in the potbefore plus his\nbet plus your call.You'll win $580 if\nyou win this hand.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.103}, {"text": "So your call is\ncontributing 17% of the pot.And just so you\nguys know, peopleuse pot odds in a different way.They talk about 1 to 4 and\nuse a different notationfor referring to your\nchance of winning.I always thought this\nwas very intuitive,so that's what I'm going\nto be teaching you guys.It's a percentage of the\npot that you can contribute.So if your win percentage\nis more than 17%,this is a plus EV call,\nand this should be fairlyeasy to wrap your head around.And your win percentage\ncan just be calculatedbased on what cards will\nmake you win divided by whatcards are left in the deck.And those are called outs.Cards that result in a win for\nyou based on your best estimateare called an out.So when you're going for a\nflush-- so there are 13 hearts.You already know\nabout four of them.They're either in your\nhand or on the board.There are nine\nhearts left that youcould hit to make your\nflush and presumably win.So your win percentage--\nthis is calculating it outexactly-- is just 1 minus your\nchance of hitting the flushon either one of those cards.So it's 40 out of\n49 times 39 outof 48, which is\nabout equal to 34%.So since this 34%, our chance\nof winning, is more than 17%,the proportion of a call\nthat we're contributing,this makes it a good call.And the fact that this is\nreally big compared to thismakes it a really good call.So this is how I think of it\nin terms of visualizing it.So this whole pie\nis the $580 potthat it would be if you called.This chunk is your 34% pot odds.Now, this chunk can be\ncomprised of the sizeof the bet you're\ncalling and your expectedvalue from calling.So here, the size of the chunk\nis $197, which was 34% of $580.We can contribute\nup to that amount.If we get to\ncontribute less of it,", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "that means that any\nadditional chunk is EV.We are making $97\nfor making this call.Similarly, if we make\na call that's too big,we end up with a negative\nchunk of that pie.So I'm teaching you a\nquick rule for calculatingyour chance of winning any\nhand, and the quick ruleI'm going to use\nis by Phil Gordon.So let's talk about Phil Gordon.So Phil Gordon got-- he\nseems like an OK guy.He got fourth place\nin the main event.He won a World Poker tour.He won two British\nchampionships.He's the head referee\nof the World Seriesof rock, paper, scissors.These guys get into\nreally interesting thingswhen they're not playing\npoker, and he's the author PhilGordon's Little Green Book.So Phil Gordon invented\nthis thing whichcaught on called Gordon's\nrule of two and four,which basically just\nsays each of your outsis worth 2% for\neach additional cardyou get to see for\nthat side of the bet.And it should be fairly\nobvious where 2% comes from.It's just 1 divided\nby 50, and it'sa rough estimate of what each\nout is worth over 49, or 48,or however many cards are left.If you get to see both the\nturn and the river, you use 4%,and that's the whole role.I'm sure someone\nfigured it out before,but he was nice enough\nto coin it and writein his book, which is why\nI'm giving him credit for it.So some examples of these\nare if you have a low pairand you're trying to\nget three of a kindby the turn or the\nriver, you have two outs.And if you're\ntrying to figure outyour chance of making that\nthree of a kind on the turn,you do two outs times 2% for a\ntotal of 4% to make your hand.Simple enough.Other common examples\nare flush draw,which should be nine outs\nto give you odds of 9divided by 47, or about 18%.An inside straight\ndraw is four outsto give you odds 4\nout of 47, or 8%.And you can see this is\nthe exact calculation,but it's really very close\nto just multiplying by 2.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So back to pot odds.Your break even is when EV is 0.That's a common theme that\nwe're going to be talking about.So the bet is x\ninto a pot of $380.Your chance of hitting the\nflush is 9 times 4%, or 36%-ish.we're assuming that we\nget to see both cards.Why do I think we're going\nto get to see both cards?Because he's all in, and\nhe can't bet anymore.So win percentage is 36%.Our exact win rate\nis 34%, showingthat this is pretty close.We didn't actually need\nto do any heavy mathto get a good ballpark number.So the question here is,\nwe're facing a bet of $370.The pot before we\nface that bet is $380.And the question\nis, should we call?Because you're not going--\nyou can solve the thresholdconceptually just to\nget a resilient solutionset, especially when\nyou're doing thingsbefore or after the\nfact, but in real time,we're going to want a rule\nfor how to figure this out.So let's talk through\nthis one, and then we'llgo through the solution\non the next side.So we have to figure out\nwhether to call this.So what are we drawing to?So we're drawing to a flush.So how many cards will\nresult in a flush here?Nine, right.So there are nine remaining\nhearts in the deck,and then we get to\nsee one or two cards.AUDIENCE: Two cards.PROFESSOR: Yep, I agree.So we get to see two\ncards because he's all in.So our chance of winning is\n4% times 9, so 9%, 18%, 36%.So we can call up to 36%.We can contribute up to\n36% of the final pot.So we would contribute $370 into\nthe final pot of 2 times thisplus 1 times this.And just offhand,\nyou can calculate--you can figure out\nthat's around 1/3,because the pot is about\nequal to the size of his bet.So we're contributing a\nlittle bit less than 33%,so we know that this is\ngoing to be a good call.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.129}, {"text": "And that's how you would\ndo this in real time.You'd say you're 36% to win.You're contributing 33% of the\npot, so you decide to call.And that's how you would\nmake this decision.So let's do a couple\nmore examples.These are all\ndifferent situationswhere this type of\nthing might come up.So here's a situation where\nwe have asymmetrical stacks,although the blinds\nare the same.So we have six,\nseven of diamonds.I'm using the four color deck\njust to make it easier to see.Something happens pre-flop\nthat doesn't really matter.On the flop, there'\n$320 in the pot.He bets $150.So what we do here?So what are we drawing to?We're drawing to a straight.So how many outs do we have?How many cards will\nhit that straight?AUDIENCE: Eight.PROFESSOR: Eight, yeah.So we got four nines\nand then four fours--will make us hit that straight.So eight outs total.So what's our chance of\nwinning this hand basedon what we're calling here?AUDIENCE: 32%.PROFESSOR: Yeah, 8%, 16%, 32%.Yep, I agree with that.So based on that,\nwhat do we haveto contribute to\nstay in this hand?What percentage\nof the future pot?AUDIENCE: Less than 1/3.PROFESSOR: Yeah,\nsomething less than 1/3,because if he get exactly\n$320, that would be 1/3.So we know this is\nway less than 1/3,and since we're 32% to\nwin, this is probablygoing to be a good call.So going through the\nquestions-- so wehave an open ended\nstraight draw, meaning wehave eight outs because\ntwo different cardswould result in the straight.Our outs are any\nnine and any four.We have a 33% chance\nof hitting it,and what's the correct play?Call, because $150 out of $620,\nwhere $620 is the pot plus $300is 24%.OK, so that wasn't bad.So those are two common draws.One was a flush draw, and\none was a straight draw.So let's go to something\na little bit different.So we have five\nfive on the button.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.192}, {"text": "He raises into us.I call, and the flop comes\nthree clubs, five, ace, six.He bets $200.OK, cool.So this is a situation\nwhich I'm sure a lot of youmay have run into recently.So what hand are\nwe drawing to here?Why do we think we're behind\nif we have three fives here?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]\ntwo of clubs [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Yeah, he might\nhave a flush, certainlyto the point where I'm not super\ncomfortable with the set hereknowing that it's reasonably\nlikely for someoneto have a flush here, or even\nif he doesn't have a flushand we bet, he's only\ngoing to call us reallyif he has a flush\nor a better hand.So he has a flush--\nwhat are we drawing to?What beats a flush here?AUDIENCE: Full house.PROFESSOR: Full house, good.What else?AUDIENCE: Four fives.PROFESSOR: Yep, four of a kind.OK, so what are our outs here?AUDIENCE: Seven.PROFESSOR: Yep, I agree.Seven outs.What are they?[INTERPOSING VOICES]Yep.So three aces, three\nsixes, one five.So we have seven outs total.So what's our\nchance of hitting--do we count one\nor two cards here?AUDIENCE: One.PROFESSOR: One.Why?Because he has a\nlot of chips behind,and there's no way, if he's\nbetting this on the flop,he's giving us a free\ncard on the turn,unless for some reason he\nthinks we have a flash,but we certainly\ncan't count on that.OK, so what did we say?Seven outs.So we use 2% for the\nnext card, or 14%.So we can call up to\n14% of the future part.The future pot is going\nto be $2100, $2300,so we can call 14% of that.So what's a good\nestimate of that?It's going to be more than\nmy 280 because 14% of $2000is $280, right?", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.381}, {"text": "So he's betting\nmaterially less than that.He's way under betting\nwhatever he has here.If he has a flush,\nhe's not protecting it.If he doesn't have a\nflush, he's losing.So this is a very common example\nof a villain not protectinghis hand.This is a situation where I\nsee a lot of newer playersscrew up.They're betting so little--\nthey're betting littlebecause they don't want\nthe other guy to fold,but they're actually\nlosing valuebecause the other guy folding\nhere would be preferable.They should bet enough that\nhe either folds or he makesa wrong decision if he calls.So we're drawing to full\nhouse or four of a kind, whichyou guys got right.Our outs are three aces,\nthree sixes, and one fivefor seven cards total.Our chance of hitting the draw\nis 14%, so the correct play is?AUDIENCE: Call.PROFESSOR: Yep, the\ncorrect play is call,because he's only asking us for\nto contribute 9% of that pot.Since we're 14% to win,\nthe chunk in that pieis bigger than the 9% chunk\nthat we have to contribute,and the result is this $122\nfree that he's giving us.OK, so I think this\nis my last example.This one should be a\nlittle bit more fun.So this is it.So why is this a draw\nthat we're looking at?We're the first one to act.Why does this matter?Can anyone tell\nwhat's going on here?AUDIENCE: Big blind [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Yeah,\nso the villain hereis all in blind with that $200,\nbecause that's the big blind.So by calling here or by doing\nanything, he is going all in.So really it's like\nhe acted before us,and now we're deciding\nwhether we want to act.So what are we drawing to here?What are we facing?What does he have\nin terms of a range?AUDIENCE: Anything.PROFESSOR: Any two cards.And then so what\nare we drawing to?In general, we're drawing\nto basically anything.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.195}, {"text": "We're hoping that we win\nsome amount of the time,and what percentage\ndo we have to win?First let's start with\nwhat's a reasonable estimatefor the amount we could win,\nthe percentage of the time?So what are some hand versus\nhand percentages that you know?So what's aces versus anything?AUDIENCE: 80%.PROFESSOR: Yeah,\nit's like 80% or 85%.And then if he doesn't have a\npocket pair higher than bothof our cards, you're generally--\neven if you're dominated,you're like 70/30,\nand then the majorityof random versus\nrandom is between 60/40in either direction.So say that-- what\npercentage of the timedo we have to win here for\nthis to be a good call?So what's the size of the\nbet that we're facing hereif we're the small blind?$100, right?So we're contributing\n$100 here to wina pot of $400, which is\ngoing to be on big blindfrom each of us.So if we're more than 25% to win\nhere, this is a plus EV call.And I see a lot of people\nscrew this up for some reason,but you're virtually\nalways ahead of 25% here.So what we're drawing\nto here is anything,and our chance of\nhitting the drawis we're actually about\n40% versus his range.And even the worst heads up\nhand versus any two cardsis 32%, so we're really\ncalling blind there.We are always\nahead of his range.So the correct play is\ncertainly going to need a call,and the EV is like $60.So if we fold this, it's\nworth about $60 chips.So let's talk about\nimplied out odds.So the solution to an\nimplied odds questionis the number of\nchips that we haveto win after hitting our draw.So I'm using that specific\nlanguage because for pot odds", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.23}, {"text": "the solution is whether\nor not you can call,or what's the maximum\nbet you can call.For implied odds,\nit's different.It's the number of chips\nyou have to win laterto make the call good.It's the amount of\nbasically dead moneyyou need to add to the\npot after the fact.So the way that we do that is\nwe take a look at our percentagechance of winning--\nsay it's 20%--and then we figure out what\nsize would the pot have to beto make the bet we are currently\nfacing be 20% of that pot.So here's an example, and\nwe're using easier numbershere because we're\ndividing by percentages.So say we have a flush\ndraw and we're 18% to hit.If the pot is $300 and we\nhave a bet of $180 into us,our call is going to\nbe 27% of the pot.So if we had a 27% chance of\nwinning that would be a breakeven call, but we don't.We have an 19%\nchance of winning.So by pot odds, it\nsays don't call.But to figure out\nwhat the amount isthat we want the\npot to be, we justdivide that $180 by\nthe 18% of our oddsto get this $1000 number.So if the part were $1000,\nwe could make that call.So the solution\nhere is this $340difference, which\nis the actual partafter we call-- the difference\nbetween that and the potthat we need to make\nthis call neutral.That's where this\n$340 comes from.And it has to be in dead money.It has to be money\nthat's added to the potafter we already hit our flush.So to visualize-- so we\nneed that bet of $180from the example I just\ngave to be 18% of the pot.That's what makes it a good bet.As of the time that\nwe make the decision,our bet here represents\n27% of that pot.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.349}, {"text": "However, if we can\nincrease a pot by $340,that bet would be\n18% of that new pot.So that gives us the right\nimplied odds to make this call.And what we need to figure\nout is whether this $340number is realistic-- the\ndifference between this $1000and that $660.So are we following that?Is that making it\neasier to understandwhat we're trying to figure out\nwhen we're doing implied oddsquestion?AUDIENCE: Yes.PROFESSOR: OK, cool.So I think I have two or\nthree examples here justto walk through that idea.So here's a hand.So here's a decision\nwe're facing,and we need to figure out\nwhether this is a good call.So we have plenty\nof chips behind.We all started with\n$1000, and then we'reprobably not winning this hand\nbecause we have middle pair.So we're drawing to two\npair or three of a kind.Our outs are these, which\nare five outs total,which gives us a chance of\nhitting our draw of what?So do we get to see\none or two cards?AUDIENCE: One.PROFESSOR: Right.We get to see one card,\nbecause presumably he'sgoing to bet again.So we multiply by 2% to get a\n10% chance of hitting the draw,and then let's go back to this.So what does the pot\nhave to be to makethis bet 10% of the future pot?AUDIENCE: $1000.AUDIENCE: $900.PROFESSOR: Well, it\nneeds to be $1000,because we're contributing\n$100 of some potthat we have 10% equity in.So it needs to be\n$1000, which meanshow much additional money do we\nneed to add after we call that?So after this call it's\ngoing to be $100, $475, $575,because we're calling $100, so\nthat's going to be in the pot,too.And then it's the delta\nbetween that and $1000", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.334}, {"text": "that we care about.So it's going to be\n$1000 minus $575.We need to draw $425\nin addition at the end.So I have a 10%\nchance of hitting.Our odds are 16%, meaning\nwe can't call it there.However, if we can pull\nout that $100 bet dividedby the 10% odds that we\nneed, it creates $1000 potwith the difference of $575.So we need $425 more on\nthat after we hit our drawto make that a good call,\nwhich in that situationseems reasonable.So he got $100\ninto a pot of $400.Presumably he'll bet like\n$200 or $300 next hand,and then we can re-pop\nhim for anything.Even if it's a min bet,\nwhich he'll presumablybe obligated to call,\nespecially because thisis a very hidden draw, we'll be\nable to make this a good call.So I think this is reasonably\na good call based on Ithink we could get $400,\n$500 more at least.So let's do another\none of these.So I'm going to make these all\nfrom the same position and allthe pre-flop actions\nthe same justto make it simple to\nsee what's going

drawing to a flush.We're drawing to anything else.[INTERPOSING VOICES]So, I would agree we're\ndrawing to a royal flush also.And I'm going to say the\nover pair might not be good.One pair I wouldn't\nconsider a great hand,especially when we're--\nwhat were blinds here?$50, $100?So we have an m of like $50?Something like that.", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.256}, {"text": "So I think our m-- our top\npair is not that great here,but I do think\nthe flush is good.Probably like a king\nhigh flush is good,and then the straight\nis good, too.So how many outs\ndo we have here?So how many outs to the flush?AUDIENCE: Nine.PROFESSOR: Right, so we have\nnine other clubs in the deck.And then how many\nouts to the straight?AUDIENCE: Eight.PROFESSOR: Eight, right.So we have 17 outs, and\nthen how many are overlaps?AUDIENCE: Two.PROFESSOR: Two, right.So let me make sure\nI got that right.So 9 plus 8.17 Minus 2.Yep, 15.So we have 15 outs here.And then how many cards\nare we going to see?AUDIENCE: One.PROFESSOR: We're\ngoing to see one.I really wouldn't\nestimate that we'regoing to see two cards, unless\nsomeone is specifically all in.So use one card here.So we have 15 outs over\none card, so what'sour percent chance of\nwinning on that next card?AUDIENCE: 30%.PROFESSOR: 30%, good.So what would the pot\nhave to be eventuallyto make this a good call with\nour 30% chance of winningthis hand?AUDIENCE: $1800?PROFESSOR: It would\nbe-- so I think itwould be $600 divided by 30%.Right?So what's that?So $600 divided by 3/10.No, I think it's going to be\nmore than that, because we'regoing to multiply by 10/3.So it's going to $6000\ndivided by 3, or $2000.Would you agree with that?So this pot has to\nbe $2000 by the end.Now, what's it going to\nbe when we call here?AUDIENCE: $1425.PROFESSOR: Yeah, let's see.So it's going to be $600--\nhis $600 plus our $600.$1200 plus $275.Yeah, $1475.So how many additional\ndollars do we need in the potafter hitting one of our draws?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Good, right.", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.384}, {"text": "So I think that's right.So drawing to straight or flush.Any ace, any nine,\nseven other clubsthat

an\nadditional $525 after itto make this a good call.So that's it.So that's how you\ndo implied odds.Just make sure you understand\nwhat the future pot has to be,and then you can use\nyour own judgmentfor whether that's a\nrealistic amount to win here.I think here $500 is\ntotally reasonable,because he already bet $600.Even if a flush comes, he's\nprobably pretty obligatedto make at

your win percentage\nof the hand-- the chanceyou hitting your\ndraw, whether that'sgreater than the call amount\ndivided by the pot plus 2 timesthe call amount, because the\nbet amount and the call amountare the same thing.If it is greater, then\nyou make the call.If it's less than, you fold.Implied odds, which we\njust went over-- it'sgoing to be the\nbet amount you'refacing divided by your

this.So this hand happened at\nthe World Series of Pokerlast year when it\nwas 10 handed, whichmeans there's it was one hand\nbefore the final table bubble,where they get to-- how it works\nin the World Series is theyplay down to nine, and then\nthey have a break for threemonths where they build\nup the final table,and they advertise it,\nand they play it live.So this is a situation that\nwas

of the year thinghas gone to his head.He's dealing with a\nlot more attitude now.One of these players\nwill join the likesof John Hewitt, Jordan\nSmith, and Don Bartonas main event 10th\nplace

with a straight,although not all\nthe time, because hedoesn't have the best straight.If a nine comes\nand then this guyhas queen, king-- or\nsorry, jack, queen,he's going to actually lose.So the question is,\nwhat does he do here?This is what it looks like.So our hero here raises $1750.He re-raises $4525 more\nto being all in for $6275.So he's drawn to a flush\nand possibly a straight.So how many outs do we have?So you can count partial outs.You can say I'm going to win\nhalf the time if I get this,just to be conservative.So you can say all\nthese clubs are", "start": 2160.0, "heat":

split,and if he has jack\nqueen, we lose.So I'm not really comfortable\ncalling those complete outs,and in the end, you can see\nit doesn't really matter.But the more\nconservative move is justsaying half the time\nwe'll win with those,and with these nine outs we're\ngoing to win all the time.You can just count\nthem as half outs,or you can count them as 2/3\nouts, or something like that.Anyway,

?]\nestimates are wrong.So this gives us a\nmore clear example.Anyway, so the correct play\nis going to be to call here.It's a little bit\ndifficult to see,but we're going\nto say that what'sin the

winning the\nWorld Series that year.OK, so we have a\nbunch of be carefuls.Do not draw to a hand\nthat may not actuallywin when you hit it,\nwhich means if you'redrawing to a flush\nthat's not even that goodand maybe dominated\nby another flush,you probably shouldn't count\nall those as full outs,or the lower end of a straight\nis really, really bad.It's really common for\npeople to draw to thatand then just go\nbroke, because theythink they made their\nhand, but as it turns out,they made the second best hand.In addition, don't draw\nout to a worse made handthan is already possible.So people refer to\nsomething calleda paired board, which means\ntwo cards on the boardhave the same number.That means that four of a kind\nor full house are possible.So if you're drawn to a straight\nor a flush, you might not even.You might be-- drawing\ndead, is what it's called.You like you might be\n0% to win that hand,so be careful on drawing\non a paired board.In addition, do not assume\nyou get to see both cards.It's really common for\nplayers to think that,OK, there are two cards left.He doesn't seem too aggressive.I'll probably get to see\nboth cards for cheap,and then find out that\ntheir assumptions whencalling the flop ended up being\nreally bad and costing them EV.So very rarely does\nsomeone check the turn.Unless the turn is\nreally scary, like youhit your draw obviously,\nor it looks like you did,no one is was going to\ngive you that for free.Another thing to\nbe careful aboutis don't overestimate\nhow easy itis to extract additional chips.It's really, really obvious\nwhen someone hits a flush draw,because there aren't that\nmany reasons people are goingto call a bet on the flop\nwhen there are two clubs on itand then bet when another\nclub hits on the turn.Flushes are really\nobvious and everyone", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.147}, {"text": "is keeping an eye on that.Straights are less\nobvious because a lotof different boards can have\na straight on it so they can'treally just assume\nthat you're goingto have a straight if there are\nany like four cards that arenear each other by the turn.And sets, like when\nyou have a pocket pairand you hit a third of\nthat pair on the turn,are basically invisible.There's no way they\ncan put you on that.So your implied odds\nfor sets are huge,whereas your implied\nodds on flush drawsare very, very small.In addition, on the other\nend, if you have a made hand,don't bet so little to give them\nthe odds to reach their draw.Basically, most of\nyour flop and turn betsshould be like 2/3\nof the pot justto punish them if they\nwant to chase their draw.OK, so that's it\nfor implied odds.So let's move on to fold equity.So here's an example.So where you guys following\nwhat was going on in that hand?Basically, I had position\npre-flop to make this call.Then on the flop I had an\nopen ended straight draw.He be small enough\nthat I should call.Same thing on the turn.I think he checked behind me\non the turn, and the riverhe checks.Why?Why is he checking\nthe river here?So he's checking\nbecause he's worried.He knows I'm drawing to\nsomething because I flatcalled, and look.I could've been\ndrawing to a flush,and he thinks I just hit it.So this is a perfect\nbluffing opportunity,because we are basically\nrepresenting a flush.So the question is,\nhow often does thishave to work to be a good\nbet versus just checkingbehind and losing nothing?With bluffing, if\nit's a bad bet,we're just going to lose\nmoney most of the time.So we have to figure out,\nwhat proportion of the timedoes this have to win\nto make it worth it?And that's what we're going\nto be looking at here.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.16}, {"text": "The concept that will give us\nthe value of making this betis called fold equity.So fold equity is\nthe value that you'regetting in a hand\nfrom the likelihoodthat the other player\nis going to fold.So with regard to\nfold equity, I'msaying your showdown value,\nwhich is this acronym here,is 0.You can't win at showdown,\nwhich is our situation there.If he calls us, we\ndefinitely, definitely lost.So the formula for\nthis is-- at leastthe EV formula is just-- so it's\na derivation of the normal EVformula that we always see.It's just the pot times your\nchance of winning-- i.e.his fold percentage--\nminus the chance of losing.And you lose that\nbet if you lose,but your risking the\nbet to win the pot.If we have the chance\nto win after he calls,we can add another\nvariable wherejust, instead of us just losing\nthis bet for the amount hecalls of the time,\nwhen he calls,we're going to get some\namount of EV, which is stillpresumably going to\nbe negative, but it'sgoing to be a less negative\nthan just losing the entire bet.So that's the basic formula\nfor semi-bluffing here.Some I'm defining\nbluffing is a betwhere it has\npositive expectationbecause the fold\nequity is more than 0.Just this term,\njust the proportionof the pot that you\nexpect to win from himfolding is greater than\nthe weighted chanceof you losing that bet.That's just going to be called\na bluff, an outright bluff.And I differentiate\nthat from semi-bluffing,where this is actually\nnegative, whereif you have a 0%\nchance of winning,it's actually a bad bet,\nbecause he calls you moretimes than makes that valuable.But a semi-bluff\nactually becomespositive expectation because of\nyour showdown win percentage.Your showdown win percentage is\nsufficiently high to offset it,", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.186}, {"text": "and this is where\nthe value comes from,because you have the\nopportunity to steal pots,but you also the opportunity\nredraw to a winning hand.And that's why in tournaments\nthis becomes somethingthat you're going to be doing\nvery often, because you're notgoing to always have made\nhands, but you're alwaysgoing to have something that\ncould become a made hand,and that becomes good enough.So how often does this have\nto work to be profitable?So I'm just going to\ngive you a formula here.So we're betting $150\ninto a pot of $350 wherewe have no chance of\nwinning if he calls.Our EV, which is just\ntaking it from that formula,is $350 times the chance we\nfold minus $150, our bet,times the chance he calls.So we can solve\nthis for EV equals 0and then solve for fold\nto get this formula.We get $150 divided by\nthe pot plus our bet.So this is our bet,\nbecause the ideais that we are putting $150\ninto that pot for a chanceof winning that whole pot back.He won't add that $150\nto the pot if we win it,so that's the idea there.So it's our bet\ndivided by the potafter we bet to give us our\nneutral EV fold percentage.So that's the chance\nof him foldingthat makes this a good bet.So I think this is pretty cool.You can use this to\ndetermine what's a good bluffand what's a bad\nbluff by just saying,is he going to call this\nmore than 1/3 of the time?And just the EV\ncalculation, lookingat using this formula to prove\nthat we reach a neutral EVis just 30% times this $350,\nthe pot minus 70%, him calling,times our bet.That equals 0.And that's our quick-- I like\nplugging this back into the EVformula just to make\nsure we messed aroundwith the variables properly.So are we OK with this so far?Because we're going to move on\nto something a little bit morecomplicated.In this one, be bet\n$75 like he did before,but we are raising $150.", "start": 2880.0, "heat": 0.154}, {"text": "Why?Why are we raising $150 here\nrather than just calling?Yeah, because we have an\nopen ended straight draw,where even if he calls,\nwe still could win,and that fundamentally\nchanges what weneed to make this profitable.So here, our chance\nof winning is 16%.8 times 2.We get to see just the river.So it's $150 into a pot of $350\nwhere our win percent is 16%.This is still our chance of\ntaking now the pot uncontested,and then the 1 minus f percent,\nthe chance that he calls,is multiplied by our\nmarginal EV, this 16% timeswinning the pot.$500 is $150 $350--\n$150 our bet,$350, the pot--\nminus $150, our bet.I guess a $150 here\nwould be his bet,but still we have a chance\nto $500 or lose $150.One of the reasons fold\nequity is really hardto teach is because there's\nno real intuitive wayto memorize this formula.So what I did here is I\njust solved for EV equals0 for our fold percentage.So we could solve this--\nI just plugged thisinto Wolfram Alpha, and I\ngot the neutral fold percentis just 12%, compared\nto here we needto win this bluff\n30% of the

shows, at\nleast intuitively,what the value is\nbut let's see if wecan figure out exactly\nhow important this winpercentage is.So we're going to have\nto use calculus for this.So when we graph

couple\nof interesting pointson this graph which\nI want to point out.So what's this point here?It's our break even fold\npercentage for having a 0 EV.So the idea is, if he\nfolds, how you read this is,if we have a 16%\nchance of winningif we're drawing to an open\nended straight for one card,if he folds more than\n12% percent of the time,if we're in anywhere in\nthis area, it's positive EVand for anywhere\ndown here it's not.So that's how we're\nreading this graph here.So what about this point here?It's a complete bluff because\nwe have 0% chance of winning,and you recognize this 30%.It's from all the way back here.It's when we had a\n0% chance of winning.So that's that point\nup there, which I thinkis pretty interesting,\nbut it gets even cooler.OK so that's what that is.It's our $150 divided\nby $150 plus $350, whichis our formula for determining\nwhat our break evenfold percentage is\nfor a complete bluff.That's our 30% here,\nbut check this out.So what is this number?It's our pot odds break even.It's the size of the\nbet that we couldcall if he was betting\nto make us neutral EV.That's what this 23% is.It's our $150 divided by\nthe pot after our call.What that means is, if\nhe folds 0% of the time,I, similarly, did he\njust bet, and then wehave the option to call.That makes a 0 EV.So this graph connects all\nof those variables for us,and that lets us derive\nsomething very interestingwith regard to implied odds.We could just figure out\nhow implied odds impactsour fold percentage by\nlooking at this secant line", "start": 3120.0, "heat": 0.132},

fold 3% less\nfor us to break even there.That's what this is telling you.When you have a 10%\nchance of winning,you just reduce\nthis amount by 15%.You multiply it by the\none and a half slope.Although it undershoots\nit by a little bit,it gives you a very,\nvery close estimateto using these implied\nodds in real time.And then so I went\nahead and figured out,OK, so that's for a\nspecific bet size.How's it work if we look at\nfor a much bigger bet or a muchsmaller bet?I found something\nreally interesting.When the bet becomes-- when\nwe go towards infinity,the partial

of the average\nacross win percentages.That's what we discovered here.And what this is\nletting us do isit's less letting us\ncreate a quick rule thatimplements implied odds.So to go over what\nthese

the pot,I have to win 25% of the time.It's a little bit off.It's like 33% of the time,\nbut it's not that bad.So this gives you\na very easy wayto determine when you\nshould bluff or not,and obviously

buffing.", "start": 3480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "But anyway, if he\ncalls 25% of the time,does that make that\na good bet or not?Yes, because that\nmeans he folds 75%of the time, which\nis more

going on?Something happened\non the flop, and thenwhat are we doing here?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Exactly.So we're betting $450\ninto a pot of $775.So the question is,\nis this a good bet?Should we have done this?And we're going to be\nfacing these decisionsall throughout the tournament.So this one is going to be kind\nof complicated, but not really.Let's see what we can\npiece together for now.So what's our chance of\nwinning this one at showdown?So we have 16%\nchance of winning.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: It's hard to--\nI prefer not counting--you can proportion partial\nouts to whatever you thinkyour real chance of winning\nif you hit that is-- say,that's worth 1/3 of an out.But in terms of being\nconservative and makingthis simple, we\ncould just say,

called, what\nproportion of the timedo we need him to fold\nto make this good?$450 divided by $1225.That $1225 is going\nto be $450 plus $775.Is that right?What was the bet?Yeah, $450 plus $775 $1225.I think this is-- $11-- $1225.I think that's right.$1225?OK, so we have a 37% chance\nof-- that's our breakeven if we have no\nchance of winning,but then we get a bonus for\nthe 16% chance of us winning,and then a general estimate\nis going to be 1.5 times,because we're making\napproximately a pot size bet.We're making it a\nlittle bit smallerso maybe this is over\ndoing it by a little bit,but this is at least\ngiving us an OK estimate.This might be a little low.It might be like 18%, but\nwe can't differentiatebetween a margin that small.So the 60% chance is related\nto our chance of winning.We get a bonus that's\nproportional to that.I'm saying 1.5, which seem\nto be about in the ballpark,to give me 13% chance break\neven for that fold rate.So even if he calls 80% of the\ntime, it makes it a good bet,and 80% is a huge\namount considering--I don't remember the situation.He could potentially\nhave nothing here.He definitely showed\nsome sort of weakness,so it's

standard bet.So the question is,\nis this a good bet?And then something we\ncan definitely figure outis what percentage\nof the time doesthis have to be a fold\nto make this a good bet.If showdown win\npercentage is 0, it'sgoing to be $1800 divided by the\npot plus $1800, his bet-- 33%.But if he actually has\na chance of winning--he has an inside straight draw.He has a 10, and then he has\nthe best possible straight.He gets up 8% of the time,\nreducing his break even foldpercentage by approximately 8%.So it's 8 times 1.5, 12.So this minus 12 is at 21%.And then this is\nsolving it out exactly.I gave them half\nouts for an ace.Maybe ace wins 1/2 the time.It turns out that 21%\nis basically dead on.So let's see what happened.[VIDEO PLAYBACK]King, jack, trey.Jacobson ahead so\nwith

could very well be.Billy Pappas makes good\nuse of that scary boardedtake down the pot.[END PLAYBACK]PROFESSOR: OK, so that's\na very common type of bet,which we'll talk about later.That's called a\ncontinuation bet.So he showed\naggression pre-flop.It's checked him on the flop.It's almost always going\nto be the right moveto bet again on the flop,\nbecause you're alreadyindicating that you\nhave a good hand,and then two face cards show up.It's reasonably\nlikely that you'regoing to have at\nleast top pair there,so it's uncommon\nfor the other guyto try to push up against\nyou since presumably youhave at least a pair of kings\nor jacks most of the time.Let's do some be careful abouts.This is a lot of stuff\nI notice from the morerecent tournaments.So don't bet too\nlittle on a bluff.That makes it very\nobvious, and thenit's usually pretty\nclear-- if youbet 1/3 of the pot, which is\nsomething that's generally notcommon for normal\nplayers, it kind ofscreams that you're not\ntoo attached to the hand.And a 2/3 of the\npot bet only reallyneeds to win a small percentage\nof time to be profitable.I get the no one likes\nto lose money on a bluff,but 1/3 bet works much less\nof the time than a 2/3,and you actually get much\nless value out of it.So bet enough.Bet like you had a normal hand.Bet enough that, if someone\nis drawing to something,they don't have the\nodds to make that call.Alternatively, don't bet\ntoo much on the bluff,and I'm making pretty\nwide ranges here sodon't think that I'm\ncontradicting myself here.One of the biggest tells for a\nbluff is someone betting morethan the pot, just because\nit means they didn't actuallythink through the\nnumbers, and they're justlike I want to bet a lot so\nthat makes the other guy fold.But in general, don't bet\ntoo much, and by too muchI mean more than the pot.", "start": 4080.0, "heat": 0.208}, {"text": "And in addition, if\nyou're short stacked,don't bluff an amount\nthat, if he raised,you'd

down nothing.Don't worry about that.One of the best indications\nto me of someonebeing a good player is they'll\nand show down a bad handand just be like, yep.That's how you play poker,\nand that'll be the end of it.So don't worry\nabout-- what you havewhen you bluff is\ncompletely immaterial.So just having a losing\nhand that's really badis no different than having\na marginal losing hand.So don't be afraid of being\nbluffing, especially live.People get embarrassed when\nthey get caught bluffing.Don't worry about it.So semi-bluffing\nis great comparedto bluffing because you have\na chance of winning the hand,but if you're in position,\nsometimes it's betterjust to take a free card.If he shows weakness\nand checks into youwhen you have an open ended\nstraight drawn, in some casesit's just going to be right to\ncheck and get your free card.You have to compare\nyour EV of checkingto your EV of bluffing.And don't bluff calling\nstations because a lotof your value from these guys\nwill come from value betting.The only way you'll\npossibly lose to themis if you try to bluff them.You might be in\na situation whereyou're ready to run\nover calling stations,but you don't have
