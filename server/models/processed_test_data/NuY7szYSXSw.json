before I\nforget, there aresome handouts at the very back.Please raise you hand if you\ndon't have any, then one of uscan actually come\nover and hand youout this sheet, which\ncontain some factsabout the visibility.Thanks a lot.And we will be using these\nthroughout the lecture.So today we're going to\ntalk about number theory.And this is a really different\nway of thinking, actually.But we will use\nthe same conceptsas you have learned before,\nlike induction, and invariance,stuff like that, to\nprove whole theorems.So what is number theory?Well, first of all,\nit's a very old science.One of the oldest\nmathematical disciplines.And only recently\nit actually gotto have some more\npractical applications.So what this number theory--it's actually the\nstudy of the integers.And what are the integers?Well, these are the numbers\n0, 1, 2 3, and so on.So number theory got--Oh, there's some more over here.Another handout over there.So number theory got used\nactually in cryptographyonly about 40 years ago.And at the end of\nthe second lecture,we will be talking about this\napplication into cryptography.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "There are many application\nin

private\ninformation to see it.So this art of\nhiding informationis extremely important,\nespecially nowadays.And number theory actually\nwill help us with this.So number theory is something,\nyou'll be very surprised,that can be used to save--oops.I have to put this on.To save New York City in the\nDie Hard number 3, I believe.So let me start up again.So let's see where it plays.Maybe not.[VIDEO

an\ninteger k, such that a canbe written as some multiple\nm, mainly k times m.So if you look at\nthis definitionwe, for example, have\nthat 3 divides 6,like what we just discussed.There's something\ninteresting going on.Suppose a is equal to 0.Well, any integer will\ndefine a, will define 0.Why is that?Because I can't take\nk to be equal to 0,so this is equal to 0\ntimes any integer

it.So what are the transitions?The transitions are,\nas we have seen, right?We can just fill\none of the jugs.We can empty those.And the other\npossibility is that wecan pour one jug over into the\nother one as much as we can.So let's write all of those out.We can do emptying.Well, how does that\nchange the state?If we have x gallons\nin this jug, and y--and y gallons in that one,\nwe can

gallon\njug, and leave the a gallon jugas it is.So these are these\ntwo transitions.And the pouring of one--of one jug into the\nother is actuallya little bit more complex.So let's have a look.So how does pouring work?Well, suppose we\nstart with x and y.So let's have a look here.Um, I don't know.Suppose we have 2 balls in\nhere, and 2 balls in here.Well, in that case, I can say\npour all of these

left with only 1.A gallon in this jug.So these are two--these are two situations\nthat we need to explain.So let's first do the first\nexample that I just did.I pour everything over\ninto the other jug.So we have 0 gallons\nleft in here,and x plus y gallons\nleft in the other jug.And this can happen if there's\nsufficient space, right?So this can only happen\nif x plus y is at most b.Which is

right?Space left.So we can take b minus y\ngallons out of this oneto fill up this one.So let's do it.We take b minus y\ngets out of the a jug,and put it all in here, and it\nmakes it completely filled

the\nother jug into the first.So let's write all\nthose out, as well.So x, y can actually go\nto x plus y, comma 0.I pour everything\nfrom here to there.And this only holds if\nx plus y is at most

have\nto pour in here?Well, that's a minus x.And we again have\na similar formula.But it now looks a\nlittle bit different.X plus y minus a.And this is only for the case\nwhere x plus y is at least a.OK.So these are all the cases.So maybe there are some\nquestions about this.Is this clear, that we have\nthese different possibilities?Like when we look at\nthese jugs we can eitherempty them, filling them up.Or we can pour say\nonly 1 ball over upto the full capacity\nof this jug.Or we can just pour everything\nover into, say, this jug.So those are the different cases\nthat are now fully describedby this state machine.So now we can start to prove\nthis theorem over here.So how do we go ahead?How are we going to use what\nyou've learned like induction,and invariance?So let's do it.But before,\nactually, we do this,let's take this\nexample that we hadand see how we can describe all\nthe transitions that we justdid, as far as I remember them.So we have that a\nequals 3, b equals 5.Right?We start with empty jugs.We need to filled up the\nfive gallon jug, right?Then we started pouring\nthe five gallon jug as much", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.22}, {"text": "as we could into

one.So we have 2, 0\nas the next state.We filled up-- actually I\nforgot exactly what we did next.But I think we filled\nup the five gallon jug.And then we simply\npoured over as muchas he could from\nthe five gallon jug.And we got 3 and\n4, and here we are.We got 4 gallons.So what we just did is fully\ndescribe this state machine.So let's not try to\nprove this theorem.So as I said, we're\ngoing to use induction.So you always would\nlike to write this outif you solve your problems.What are we going to assume?Well, we assume actually\nthat m defines a,and m defines also b.That's the assumption\nof the theorem,and now we need to prove that\ndefies any result that you canachieve in this state machine.So what's the invariance\nthat we are thinking about?Invariance is going to be--Oops.It's a predicate.And it says something\nlike, if the state xy--", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.234}, {"text": "if this is the state\nafter n transitions--Then we would like to conclude\nthat m

let's do it.The base case is--well, we start with the all\n0s, like the empty jugs.It's-- well, and we also--have paid a little\nbit of extra attentionto what we mean by\ndivision over here.We said that all integers\nactually divide 0.So in particular,\nm. m divides 0.m, 0.So the very initial\nstate, 0 comma 0,is indeed complying to\nis particular invariant.So let's write it out.So we have the\ninitial state 0, 0.We know that m divides 0.And therefore, we\nknow that p 0 is true.So that's great.So the inductive step.How do we start the\ninductive step--step all the time?And we will assume,\nactually, p of n, right?So lets assume that.And now we would like to\nprove p, and then n plus 1.So what do we really want to do?We want to say, well, we know\nthat we reached a certain

formal way.OK.So how do we go ahead?Suppose that x, y is the\nstate after n transitions.Well, what can we conclude?Well, we have the predicate\npn, the invariant.So we know that n divides\nx, and n divides y.And we concluded that\nbecause pn is true.So after another transition--what happens after\nanother transition?So we can conclude\nthat the jugs arefilled by the different\ntypes of numbersthat we see here this\nis state machine.So let's write them out.So after another transition,\num, each of the jugsis actually filled--Um, are filled with--well, either if I've emptied\nit, say

that\nthe only number thatdivides 5 both the three gallon\njug, and the five gallon jugsis actually one.So in our example, we\nwould have that m equals 1.So over here we have\nthat only 1 divides a,as well as 1 divides b.So m equals 1 in our case.But for example, in the three\ngallon jug, and the six gallonjug--Right?We have that m equals 3, like\n3 divides 3, And 3 divides 6.So those are the two cases that\nyou sort of look at right now.But you put into a much\nmore general setting, right,we are distracted away\nfrom the actual numbers.And use a and b as\nrepresentations.Are any other questions?So after another\ntransition, each of the jugsare filled with, well,\neither 0 gallons, if wehave a completely emptied them.Or we have filled the first\na gallon jug, or it can be b.We also noticed that it can be--it can be of x, of course.It can be y, because that's\nthe state that we are in.And we can have x plus y, minus\na, which appears over here.And x plus y, minus b.So these are all the\ndifferent number--possible number of gallons.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.497}, {"text": "The x plus y.That's also present.Is that true?Yeah.That's right. x plus y.So we also have x plus

they?We have that in order\nto prove this-- right?At the top over here, we assume\nthat m divides, and m dividesb.So we know that first of\nall, m divides 0, of course.But we know that m divides a.We know that m divides b.We have concluded\nthat m divides x.And also m divides y.So if you now use some\nfacts about divisibilityon your handout, which\nwe will not prove now.But I think most of them will be\non your problem set, actually.We can conclude that also linear\ncombination of a, b x and ywill be divisible by m.In particular, m\nwill divide x plus y.m will divide x plus y minus\na, and also x plus y, minus b.So we will conclude\nthat m actuallydivides any possible results.So divides any of the above.And now we're done.Why is that?Because we have shown now that\nafter the next

to\nget say 4 gallons outof this-- out of these two jugs.So is that possible?It's not.I see someone shaking his head.Do you want to explain why?AUDIENCE: A and b are\nboth divisible by 11.PROFESSOR: Yeah.AUDIENCE: So any other\nconfiguration will alsohave to be divisible by 11.And 4 is not divisible by 11.PROFESSOR: Exactly.4 is not divisible by 11, so\nthe whole cast got blown up", "start":

GCD of 3 and 5is actually equal to 1.There's no other larger integer\nthat divides both 3 and 5.In other examples are, for\nexample, if we have the GCD ofsay 52 and 44.Well, what's this equal to?Well,

at this\nparticular thing themover here, can we see a\nnice corollary of this?Like a result, if you\nthink about this greatestcommon divisor.Well, the greatest\ncommon divisor off a an bdivides both a and b.So the greatest common\ndivisor of a and bwill divide any result that\nwe can generate by playingthis game with the jugs.So the corollary here is\nthat the GCD of a and bdivides any result.OK,

linear\ncombinations, the s and the tcan be negative, or positive.We really don't care.So for example, we could\nhave like, I don't know,minus 2 times--so for example, 4 is equal\nto minus 2, times 3,

much happening.So let's figure\nout how this works.OK.So let's first formalize this\nparticular trick over here.And how do we go ahead with it?Ah, well, notice\nthat we can rewriteL, which is equal to s\ntimes a, plus t times b.s, you know, we can just add\na multiple of b over here.n times b, say m times a.And we can subtract the\nsame amount over here,minus n times a, times b.So do you see

we can choose m,such that s plus n times\nb will be larger than 0.We can do that.So essentially this proved to\nus that there exists an x prime,and also the t\nprime, such that Lcan be rewritten as\na
