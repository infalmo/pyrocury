And as we know,as you might have\nread in the news,there was really a\nbig worry about whatwill happen to the Euro\ncurrency if there isa spate of sovereign defaults.And in fact, Euro currency\ndid-- in anticipationof the possibility of\ndefault-- it actuallydid depreciate for while\nback in 2011 and 2012.Now it's pretty much back\nwhere it was before that,but it certainly--\nthere was a fearin the market-- which was also\nvery, very obvious in termsof option prices-- that Euro\ncurrency could depreciatesignificantly if, in fact, a\ndisorderly default did happen.Now it didn't happen,\nso that's good.But in other emerging\nmarkets in history,it has happened before.So it's not really\nan empty question.So foreign exchange-- how do\nwe describe it in math finance?Well, we think of\nit as the priceof a unit of foreign\ncurrency in dollars.In our presentation we're\ngoing to denote the spot FXrate, which is the current\nrate of exchange, by S.And here is a sample graph\nof euro-USD FX rates.You can see it looks\nlike a random walk.It's very well described\nin normal circumstancesas random walk.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So one very fundamental property\nthat connects FX and interestrates is the so-called\nFX forwards interest rateparity, which says if I have\na certain amount of money--in this example, $5 million,\nand I can invest it,there's two ways I can\nutilize this money.One way is to just\ninvest it at a dollarkind of risk-free rate.And we're assuming here\nwe have a risk-free rate--the standard assumption.Or we can do something\nlike we can take the money,exchange it into,\nsay, euros, investit using the euro\nrisk-free rate,and then exchange it\nback into dollars.And this is essentially used\nto price FX forward contracts.So FX forward contracts\nare a contractthat allow you to say, look,\nI'm going to agree with you,then in one month's time,\nI'm going to, say, give you4,108,405 euros, and you're\ngoing to give me back$5,170,000.It's essentially an agreement;\nit's a derivative contract.And if you see the-- if you\nhave this forward contract,you can lock in, essentially,\nthrough conversion in euros.So you can lock in an\neffective dollar interest rate.So FX forwards can be\nessentially described fullyby knowing the interest rates\nin each currency and the spot FXrate.Conversely, you can infer\nforeign interest ratesknowing the FX forwards.They're very connected.Yes?AUDIENCE: In this example,\nthere's no mispricing,so you get that same amount.Is that the idea?STEFAN ANDREEV: In this\nexample, there is no mispricing.You get back the same amount.So we are assuming, essentially,\nthere's no arbitrage.We're not assuming,\nbut we're given--", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "if the prices were, indeed,\nif this interest rate-- 4.6%in Euros-- interest rate was\n4.6, in dollars it's 3.4.And here are the current spots,\nwhich is 127 and the forward,125-- if these were, in\nfact, the observable markquantities in the market, then\nthere would be no arbitrage.And there is-- you're basically\nindifferent whether you investthe money in dollars,\nor you go the wayof exchanging into Euros, and\ninvesting in Euros, and thenback into dollars.So in this example, the way\nI've presented, worked it out,there is no arbitrage.Now, if some of these numbers--\nsay the interest rate in Euroswere 4% instead of 4.6, and\nall the other quantities werethe same, then, in fact,\nthere would be arbitrage.And you could make\nmoney by borrowing moneyin dollars and investing.I mean, the purpose\nof this slideis really to\nillustrate kind of hey,if there's no arbitrage,\nhow one would actuallycompare-- how one\nwould actually lookfor arbitrage in this example.This is-- again, this is\na little bit of definitionwhat are compound\ninterest, interest rates.We're going to talk about\ninstantaneous risk-free rates.We're going to, again,\nsay they're risk-free.So basically, we\nknow for sure we'regoing to get our money back.You can think of\nrisk-free rates as the onethat treasuries pay in\nreal life, or the onethat Federal Reserve\nguarantees on deposits.There's various examples\nof risk-free rates.And while, in practice,\ndifferent risk-free ratescan actually be different, so\nthey're not really risk-free.But in our world right\nnow, in our model,we're going to\nassume that there issuch a thing as a risk-free\nrate for every currency,and it's unique.And now, as we talk about our\ndynamics of the FX process,what's really focused\non here is an FX--", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "we're making an FX model.And we want to see-- in\nthe previous example,we saw if you're given a FX rate\nand given some interest rates,here's what the\nFX forward reallyhas to be in order\nto have no arbitrage.Well, now we are\ntrying to describe.We tried to describe or define\na process for the FX currency.Essentially, this kind\nof no-arbitrage conditionleads to having\ncertain constraintson what the stochastic\ndifferentialequation has to be.So in this particular\ncase, the constraintis that the drifts\nof the processhas to be the differential\nin interest rates.So if one currency pays more\nthan the other currency,obviously, people would want\nto invest in that currency.So that in order for\nno arbitrage to exist,there has to be an expectation\nthat the currency thatpays more would depreciate\nin the future, otherwiseit would be an arbitrage.So if it doesn't depreciate,\nif you can kind of say,hey, this currency\nwon't depreciate,then you can just always\ninvest in that currency thatpays higher interest rates and\nmake money-- which, in fact,many people do.But again, that's a-- they're\ntaking a certain risk.They're taking the risk that\nthe currency will depreciate.So what do we actually want?What we want is to say--\nwe want to essentially--and for the arbitrage\nconditions from before-- whichis to say that my forward rate\nhas to be essentially the spotrate-- well, this\ncondition here hasto be observed, essentially.And what does that mean?It means that my forward\nrate has to be my spot--AUDIENCE:

"start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "essentially, the interest\nrate differential.If that is true, than\nin the previous set up,there will be no arbitrage.And why is that?Well, that's because\nthe amount of moneyI earn on the domestic\nleg is e to the rd.The amount of money I earn on\nthe foreign leg is e to the rf,but then I multiply\nby the forward,and that has to equal\nto the e to the rd.So this is a standard.This is a the most\nbasic dynamic FX modelthat people use in industry.It's referred to as the\nBlack-Scholes FX model.And the stock price-- you've\nseen stochastic models before.Usually, you see the stock price\nwhen people talk about options.In that case, this drift is just\nthe risk-free interest rate.Well, here in FX, it's a\ndifferential of interest rates.Otherwise, it's very similar.So FX has some\ninteresting properties.So we're gonna talk\nabout the game.Before we go to the\ngame, one question:can FX exchange rate\never be negative?What do you guys think?Can the dollar-euro\nexchange rate be negative?Any ideas?No, it's hard, because\nwhat does negative mean?It means I have to pay you\nmoney to give you euros.Why would you?You have to pay

one reason why\nI wrote my SDE as a kindof a log-normal process.You recognize this by\nthe form dS over S.So the changes in the FX are\nproportional to the valueof the FX.So the process can\nnever become negative.OK, so it can never\nbecome negative,but how big can it get?And the answer is,\nit can get very big.I mean, we have currencies,\nnotably some currencylike Zimbabwean dollars,\nthat traded-- I don't know,I mean, I actually don't know\nwhat Zimbabwean dollars tradeat, but I think it's\nsomewhere in the billionsof Zimbabwean dollars\nper dollar, so something.It's a really extreme

course before, right?So let's go back to our game.So our game is, we\nhave assumptions.My assumptions are\nnot to be realistic,but to make it simple.Let's assume that our dollars\nand euros exchange rate is one,so we can exchange\none Euro for $1.Clearly not exactly the case,\nbut let's make that assumption.And we also assume\nthat the FX forwardsis 1, which basically\nmeans that the

question is, which\ngame would you prefer to play,or do you not care?So in each case, you kind\nof win, lose same number.So I want to see hands.Who wants to play game A?Come on guys, wake up.Who wants

country-- of a big country\nthat has its own currency--is Argentina, 2001.And when it defaulted, the\nArgentinian peso skyrocketed.Here is the graph\nof the price series.So if you had an FX

to have\nsomething whichsays FX has to\nmove upon default.And then we're going to\nconstruct a complete market.Then we're going to define some\nsimple dynamics on our exchangerate and on

whether credit\ndefault has occurred or not.And the payoff is\nin units, anything,like foreign currency.A typical example would\nbe a credit default swapdenominated in Brazilian reais.Or that happens-- a\ncredit default swapon Brazil denominated\nin Brazilian reais.Now, common sense is that\nwhen Brazil defaults,Brazilian real is not\ngoing to cost very much.It's not going to be\nvery valuable, just as wesaw on the graph with the\nArgentinian peso, which totallydevalued, it would\ndevalue as well.Now Brazil is a very big\neconomy, strong country.So right now, people are\nbuying a lot of their bonds.People are investing in it.Still, it has credit risk.And you can buy-- you can\ntrade the credit risk.You can trade credit\ndefault swaps in dollars.And you can also\nenter into contracts", "start": 4920.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "that essentially\nquanto the credit riskinto Brazilian currency itself.And to be able to really\nprice this, you can do it.We've done it for many years\nwithout having a jump model.But then your hedge\nratios are not very good.And you cannot really\nexplain the prices you seein the market.So we are essentially\nimplementing infrastructureto-- we've already\nimplemented this modelor a version of this\nmodel, but we'reimplementing infrastructure\nto kind of reallyput it in production.As you can see in\nthis model now,your FX process\ndepends on credit.So it actually-- calibration\nand all these thingsbecome a little bit more tricky.Which I don't want to worry\nabout for your final project,but I think it would be a\nvery interesting exerciseto take something like\nthat, and basicallywork out all the steps.It does get a little\nbit more complicated,because now you have to--\nif you're doing Ito's lemma,you've got to do it both\nfor diffusive processesand for a jump\nprocess, so you'regoing to have two terms\nin your Ito's lemma.But you've seen them both.They're in your class notes.If you're so inclined,\nyou can do it.And you can-- once\nyou solve the model,then you can kind of\ncheck your results.You can actually build a\nMonte Carlo simulation,or actually run a\nbunch of paths whereyou simulate both the default\nand the diffusive part,and see if your prices\narrived at analytically matchwith your expectations\ncomputed by Monte Carlo.This will be a good-- it's\nalways a very good checkto see if--

other way around.OK, so in real life,\nas we went over--I mentioned a couple of\ntimes during the lecture--our models are more complicated.We have stochastic interest\nrates, stochastic hazard rates.So currently, we assumed\nthat our hazard rate, h,is a fixed number.h can be stochastic as well.It can have its\nown distribution,and typically that's what we\nuse in our models-- stochasticeffects.So when I say stochastic, both\njump and diffusion processes.And then if you\nget really fancy,then you can start putting\ncorrelations between interestrates, FX and hazard rates.So in particular, having\na jump of FX on defaultnaturally introduces\na correlationbetween credit and FX.When credit occurs, FX devalues.So clearly, there's going\nto be a correlation.But there also could be a\ncorrelation between the hazardrates themselves and FX.So it's another\nsource of correlation.And these correlations would\nproduce different effectsin the market.So basically, you can, if\nyou have enough data points,you'd be able to\nsay, well, this modelseems like it describes the\nmarket better than that model.Both of them produce\nquanto effects, though.And whether we use analytic\nsolutions or Monte Carlo,they're different approaches to\nprice derivatives and computerisk.It depends, really, on\nhow complex your model is.And for certain\nmarkets, you'd ratherhave a

think there's probably\na question or twothat people might have.AUDIENCE: I was wondering\nif we could now answer whichof the Italian bets was better.STEFAN ANDREEV: Which what?AUDIENCE: Which of the\nbets that we initiallywere considering on the\nItalian bonds was better?Could we answer that now?Because we haven't, I think.STEFAN ANDREEV: Yeah.Yeah, let's go back.Which Italian bonds was better?What was that?OK, so let's try to\nanswer that together.And we can answer it\nwithin our model, right?So in reality, there's\nall kinds of factorsgoing into the price.So there's supply\nand demand, liquidityin euros, liquidity in dollars.Well, let's say if you're\ntrying to invest in euros,or trying to invest in\ndollars, if I investin dollars, if a\ndefault happens,I lose essentially-- let's\nsay the recovery was zero.So I lose all my\nmoney in dollars.I thought I had some\namount of money in dollars.Default occurs.I lost my dollars.Same thing in euros.", "start": 5280.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "If I invest in euros, if\ndefault occurs, I lose my euros.So how much do I lose\nin a case of eurosand in the case of dollars?So if I invested euros, you\nsay, well, if a default happens,my euros are maybe\nnot as valuable.So euros are not as\nvaluable, so I lost my euros,but what I lost was not as\nmuch, because already it'salso the value of the lot.Conversely, is we saw, because\nof the compensator drift--remember, if you have a\njump that makes the currencydevalue upon\ndefault, the currencywill tend to appreciate\nif default doesn't happen.Because we want the-- the\nexpected value of the currencyhas to be-- that's determined\nby interest rates parity,the first thing we talked\nabout-- the interest ratedifferential.So that is kind of an\nironclad arbitrage conditionthat we have to follow.So if you want your FX forward\nto really-- the expected valueof your FX to remain fixed by\nthe interest rate differential,and you know that upon default,\nyour currency would devalue,that means if the\ncurrency does not devalue,it's going to appreciate.Because if a default\ndoes not happen,the currency would appreciate\nrelatively speaking.So in our case, when\nwe're buying bonds,we only get paid if\ndefault does not occur.So you would\nrather, essentially,buy the bonds in\nthe currency that'sgoing to relatively\nappreciate, essentially.Suppose interest rates\nwere zero in both cases.You would rather buy the bond\nwhere FX would appreciate itdefault does not occur.Because if it occurs, you get\nnothing in any case, right?But if it doesn't occur,\nwhen you get paid,you want something that would\nappreciate versus somethingthat would not.So the dollar,\nfor example, let'ssay the dollar doesn't move\nversus other currencies", "start": 5400.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "when the euro default happens.So you'd rather\nget the euro bonds.AUDIENCE: If you want\nto estimate recovery,can you use a\nbunch-- I mean, notnecessarily factors\nalready in the model,but outside factors like\nmacroeconomic factorsto predict the expected\nvalue of recovery?STEFAN ANDREEV:\nAbsolutely, yeah.Recovery is something that\nwe cannot really price,necessarily, because\nusually we have bonds.And the bond price-- you can say\nwe model default, probabilityof default versus\nprobability of non-default.But now if you introduce\na second variable, whichis the recovery, now you have\nessentially both probabilityof defaults and recovery\namount as variables.And you have only price\nas your data point.And you can have\ninfinitely many solutions.So typically, what\nhappens is youfix the recovery at something.Now what do we use\nto fix the recovery?Well, for sovereign\ncountries we use 25%and for corporates we use 40%.But these numbers--\neverybody knowsthat they're kind\nof just conventions,really, more than anything.We don't really believe that\nrecovery is really 40% or 25%.It varies a lot by corporation.And there are studies\nby credit agenciesabout how much recoveries--\nwhat are the recoveriesfor various bonds.And this 25% for\nsovereign is basedon some study like that\nthat went over the last 50years, looked at the\nrecoveries of sovereigns,of which there are not\nthat many every year.But if you look at 50\nyears, there's quite a few.And then they made\nsome statements--some recover higher,\nsome recover lower,but on average,\nthey recover 25%.If you remember in Greece,\nwhat happened in Greece,how much did bondholders in\nGreece get for their bonds?Now, they didn't really\ndefault, technically.Well,

do\nsome settlements.So how much did people recover?Well, it depends who you are.If you took the original deal,\nmaybe you got $0.20, $0.25,$0.30 on the dollar.Maybe you got $0.20\non the dollar.But now if you hold\nout-- if you held out,apparently you got a\nlittle bit more eventually.So it's a little bit\nof a fuzzy concept.But it's not something--\nyou usually makean assumption of what it is.AUDIENCE: And in a\nrelated question,so how would we also\nestimate the other constantslike the hazard rate and the J?STEFAN ANDREEV: So once\nyou fix the recovery rate,then you can take\nthe bond price.And because bond\nprice theoreticallyis e to the minus hT, you can\nestimate h from the bond price.So if you observe a bond\nprice in the market,you can say, I'm\ngoing to estimate h.So let's say I'm going to take\nsome benchmark bonds whichI know the price of, and\nI'm going to estimate hfor each of these bond prices.And I'm going to\ncreate a curve, whichis going to be my hazard curve.And then I take another\nderivative or bondthat I don't know the price of,\nand I can use the same curveto price it.So essentially by doing\nthis, what I'm saying is,I'm going to replicate\nmy derivativeusing these benchmark\nbonds as much as I can.That's the assumption\nthat I'm making.AUDIENCE: And how\nlong [INAUDIBLE]", "start": 5640.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "if multiple
