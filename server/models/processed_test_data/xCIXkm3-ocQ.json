[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Hi.Welcome to recitation.My name is Martina, and I'll\nbe your recitation instructorfor some of these\nlinear algebra videos.Today's problem is\na straightforwardsolve the following\nlinear systemwith four equations\nand four unknowns,using the method of elimination.The system is x minus y minus\nz plus u equals 0, 2x plus 2zequals 8, minus y\nminus 2z equals -8,and 3x minus 3y minus\n2z plus 4u equals 7.And although you might\nknow different waysto solve the system\nat this point,the method of\nelimination is goingto show up a million\ntimes during these videos,so it's really important\nto get it right.So I suggest you try solving\nthis system now, usingthe method of elimination as\nit was described in class.I'm going to leave you\nalone with the problem.You should pause the\nvideo, solve it yourself,and then come back and compare\nyour solution with mine.And we're back.So the method of elimination,\nif you remember it from class,consisted of replacing this\nsystem with an equivalentsystem-- equivalent meaning\nthey have the same solution--by a series of row operations.Row operations are not\nsupposed to change the solutionto the system.And they're, for\nexample, exchangethe order of two equations.Multiply an equation\nwith a nonzero number,and add a nonzero multiple\nof one equation to the other.So let's do that.As we're going to do this\nseries of arithmetic operations,we don't really want\nto copy the namesof the variables and the\nequality signs every time.So we're going to keep the\nimportant information whichare these numbers.these coefficients\nhere, we're goingto keep that\ninformation in a matrix.So let's write a matrix.Each row is going to\ncorrespond to an equation,and each column is going to\ncorrespond to an unknown.So the first row\nis 1, -1, -1, 1.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "The second row, corresponding\nto the second equation,is 2, 0, 2, 0.And you want to be very careful\nto put 0's on the right spotshere.The third equation is\n0-- I haven't left myselfenough room-- 0, -1, -2, 0.And the fourth\nrow, correspondingto the fourth equation,\nis 3, -3, -2, 4.And as we care about the\nright-hand side as well,we're going to copy this\ninformation as well,and get the augmented\nmatrix of the system.0, 8, -8, 7.OK, and now let's try\nreducing this matrixto an upper triangular one.We start with the\nfirst column, and we'regoing to use this\nnumber, called a pivot,to get rid of all\nthe numbers under it,so to get 0's here and here.A way to do it is-- well,\nto get rid of this 2,I have to multiply\nthe first row by -2,and add it to the second one.Writing this here is\nnot strictly necessary,but I like to do a\nbit of bookkeeping,because I'm prone to\nmake a lot of errorswhile doing this simple\narithmetic operations.And then if I get\nto the end, figureout I made a mistake\nsomewhere, this bookkeepingmakes it easier to\nbacktrack and find the placewhere I made this mistake.So we replace this matrix\nwith another matrix.The first row stays the same.1, -1, -1, 1, 0.The second row gets replaced\nby the second row minus 2 times", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "the first row.The aim of that is to get\na 0 here, so that's good.Next, on this position\nhere, we get -2 times -1,which is 2, plus 0 which is 2.-1 times -2, which is\n2, plus 2, which is 4.-2 plus 0 which is -2.And 8 minus 2\ntimes 0 which is 8.The third row\nalready has a 0 here,so I can just copy it over.0, -1, -2, 0, -8.And to get a 0 here, I'm going\nto multiply the first row by -3and add it to the fourth row\nand get 0, -3 times -1 is 3,minus 3 is 0.-3 minus 1-- oh, sorry-- 3 minus\n2 is 1, and -3 plus 4 is 1.And there we go.The first column looks\nlike a first columnof an upper triangular matrix.Now let's do the same\nto the second column.This is going to be our\npivot, the number that we useto get rid of numbers under it.And we see that to\nget rid of this numberhere, we will need to\nmultiply it with 1/2.So multiply the whole\nsecond row with 1/2,and add it to the third row.The matrix that we get will\nhave the first row the same.It stays the same.1, -1, -1, 1, 0.The second row stays the same.0, 2, 4, -2, 8.The third row gets\nreplaced by the third row", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "plus 1/2 times the second row\nand becomes 0, 0, 2 minus 2which is 0, -1 plus 0 which is\n-1, and 4 minus 8 which is -4.And the fourth row already has\na 0 here so I just copy it over.0, 0, 1, 1, 7.And now let's look\nat this matrix.It has the first two columns\nas they're supposed to be,0's under the diagonal.And now we want to get a 0 here.Normally what I would do is\nto circle this number here,multiply it by something\nso that I get a -1,and add it to this\nrow to get a 0 here.But that's not going to work.You might remember from lecture\nthat 0's can never be pivots.Or you can just try finding\na number such that 0times this number\nequals -1, and seeingthat such a number\ndoesn't exist,because you're always\ngoing to get 0.So we can proceed\nas we did until now.But is there another\nway to get a 0 here?There is a very\nsimple row operation,which consists just of switching\nthe third and the fourth row.It certainly doesn't change\nthe solution of the system.So let's do that.And let's get the next matrix\nwhich is 1, -1, -1, 1, 0.0, 2, 4, -2, 8.Then we put the fourth row here.0, 0, 1, 1, 7.And we put the third row\nhere, 0, 0, 0, -1, -4.And there it is.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "This is an upper\ntriangular matrix.So in the same way as at the\nbeginning, we had a systemand then wrote the\nmatrix representing it,this matrix also\nrepresents a system.And this system has the same\nsolutions as the initial systembut is much easier to solve.Now let's write this\nback as a system,and let me do that not starting\nfrom the first equation,but starting from\nthe last equation.So the last equation\nhere reads -uequals -4, which\nis, as equations go,a pretty easy one to solve.The solution is u equals 4.Now let's go back to\nthe third equation.The third equation\nreads y-- no, I'msorry-- z-- the third column\ncorresponds to z-- plus uequals 7.But we know what's u now.So, it reads z plus 4 equals 7,\nwhich just becomes z equals 3.The second equation is 2\ntimes y plus 4 times z,but z is 3, minus 2 times\nu, but u is 4, equals 8.And from this, one can easily\ncompute that y is equal to 2.And finally, the first equation\nreads x minus y minus z plus uequals 0, or x equals 1.And this is our solution.x, y, z, and u equal\n1, 2, 3, and 4.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "This finishes the problem,\nbut I would very stronglyencourage you now to\ntake this solutionand plug it back into\nthe original systemand check if it's\nreally a solution.And that's all I\nwanted to say today.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}]
