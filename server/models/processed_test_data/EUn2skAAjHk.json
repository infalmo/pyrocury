[{"text": " then layer chromatography or TLC is a common analytical technique used in organic laboratories TLC can be helpful when you are trying to identify the components of a mixture or assess the purity of a sample it is also used to monitor both reactions and purifications it can take some time to become a pro at TLC but this video should help to familiarize you with the basic technique TLC plates are composed of a thin layer of a polar adsorbent either silica or alumina which has been bound to a plate of solid support generally plastic or glass in most cases a fluorescent powder is also mixed in with the adsorbent to aid with visualization as you will see later in this video a sample is applied to a TLC plate using a thin glass spotter micropipettes such as the ones shown here can be used and are conveniently commercially available however in many laboratories TLC spotters are prepared by heating and poling capillary tubes or disposable Pasteur pipettes one benefit of making your own spotters is that these homemade spotters are usually thinner than commercially available micropipettes you can watch the advanced thin layer chromatography video for a demonstration of this procedure once a TLC plate has", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.106}, {"text": " been spotted with a sample it is developed in a developing chamber that can easily be assembled from a glass jar with a lid a piece of filter paper and five to ten milliliters of an appropriate developing solvent before you get started make sure you also have a pair of tweezers a pencil and a ruler close at hand assembling the developing chamber is very straightforward first slide the filter paper into the jar so that it is flat against the wall next pour an approximately 8 millimeter layer of the appropriate developing solvent into the jar tilt the jar to moisten the filter paper and close the lid to prevent evaporation you should end up with a layer of solvent no more than 5 to 8 millimeters deep the moist filter paper ensures that the air in the chamber is saturated with solvent vapor it prevents evaporation of solvent from the TLC plate during development once you have put together your developing chamber it is time to prepare the TLC plate in this video plastic fact alumina plates will be used for more information on preparing glass plates you can watch the advanced TLC video before you start there are a few things to remember always use a pencil and never a pen to mark your TLC plates ink is soluble in organic solvents and will be developed along with your sample make sure that you always mark and spot your sample on the dull and not the shiny side of the TLC plate remember the dull side is coated with the adsorbent even though", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " you should be wearing gloves while handling TLC plates it is important that you do not touch the face of the plate with your fingers oils from your skin or other contaminants can adsorb to the plate and affect your results before you can apply your sample to a TLC plate it is important to mark the plate so that you can keep track of where the sample is applied one way to do this is to draw a straight line approximately one centimeter from the bottom of the plate draw small ticks through the line at each point where you will apply a spot of sample it is important that the spots are not too close to the edge of the plate or evaporation from the sides of the plate will result in inconsistent result it is also important that the spots are not too close together or you will end up with overlapping spots after you develop the plate applying your sample to the plate is probably the trickiest part of TLC and it may take some practice before you can consistently apply the right amount of sample in a small enough spot your TLC sample should be fairly dilute containing approximately one to two percent of the desired compound if the sample is too dilute you will not be able to visualize the spots if the sample is too concentrated you will observe large streaky spots on your final plate to spot the plate dip the glass spotter into the sample and touch it lightly and quickly to the plate wait briefly for the solvent to dissolve before spotting again generally one two three spots will suffice it is crucial that you do not leave the spotter on the plate for too long or you will end up", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " with large diffuse spots it's difficult to separate mixtures on a TLC plate when the spots are too big try to keep the spots one to two millimeters in diameter the smaller the better once you have applied your sample and the spots have dried it's time to develop the plate using your tweezers pick up the plate and place it in the developing chamber make sure that the solvent level is below the spots on the plate otherwise you will end up with your sample dissolved in the developing solvent replace the cap to prevent evaporation of solvent off of the plate and try not to let the edges of the plate touch the filter paper this will disturb the capillary motion of the solvent on the plate keep a close eye on the solvent front do not let the solvent get closer than 5 to 10 millimeters from the top of the plate when the solvent front gets too close to the top evaporation from the top of the plate becomes a problem the spots keep moving up the plate but the solvent front appears to stop this leads to incorrect RF values when the solvent front has reached an appropriate height remove the plate and immediately draw a line at the solvent front this line will be necessary for the calculation of RF values when the compound of interest is brightly coloured no extra steps need to be taken to visualize the spots however most organic compounds are colorless and cannot be seen on a TLC", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " plate with the naked eye fortunately most TLC plates contain an additive that causes the plates to fluoresce under ultraviolet light certain UV active compounds are capable of quenching this fluorescence as a result they appear as dark spots on the glowing TLC plate UV lamps such as this one are commonly found in laboratories for just this purpose just place your plate under the lamp turn it on and mark the spot with a pencil a number of TLC stains have also been developed to aid in the visualization of spots that cannot be seen under a UV light you can watch the advanced thin layer chromatography video for a demonstration of a few of these staining procedures TLC data is described in terms of RF values under a specific set of conditions a particular compound should always exhibit the same RF let's quickly run through the procedure for calculating an RF value first measure the distance from where the spot started on the plate to where it ended up always measure from the center of the final spot we'll call this distance a next measure the distance from where the spot started to where the solvent front ended up we'll call this distance B do not measure from the bottom of the plate this is a common mistake that will lead to incorrect RF values the our F value is defined as the ratio between the distance the spot moved a and the distance the solvent moved B this value is dependent on the polarity of the compound and the polarity of the developing solvent polar compounds will have lower RF values than nonpolar compounds under the same developing", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": " conditions this series of plates illustrates the effect of solvent polarity on RF as the polarity of the developing solvent is increased from left to right the spot moves further up the plate the value of a gets larger while the solvent front B stays the same increasing the polarity of the developing solvent generally increases the RF values of all of the spots it is a good idea to use a developing solvent that gives you RF values between zero point two and zero point eight this will generally give you the most effective separation when you have more than one compound in your sample for example a mixture of two compounds was spotted and developed in hexanes a non-polar solvent the final plate shows only one spot with a very low RF the same mixture was developed and ethyl acetate a polar solvent and once again the final plate shows only one spot this time with a very high RF when a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate was used as a developing solvent the two spots were resolved notice that both spots are near the center of the plate TLC is frequently used to compare the identity of two compounds in a perfect world TLC data would be consistent from plate to plate and chamber to chamber unfortunately small deviations and development conditions affect the observed RF values as a result it is most convincing to compare RF values of different samples on the same TLC plate for example you know that the unknown sample marked with a question mark consists of either compound
