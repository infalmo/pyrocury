I used that title, and the older book called it \"The Society of Mind.\" The books are not quite the same. They overlap a bit in material, but they're sort of complementary. I like the old one better, because the chapters are all one page long. And they're moderately independent. So if you don't like one, you can skip it. The new book is much denser, and it has a smaller number of long chapters. And I think it's--", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.79}, {"text": " over the years, I got lots of reactions from young people in high school, for example. Almost all of whom liked \"The Society of Mind,\" and found it easy to read, and seem to understand it. There are lots of criticisms by older people who maybe some of them found it harder to put so many fragments together. Who knows? But most of this class, most of the things I'd like to say are in those books. So it's really like a big seminar, and my hope is that everyone who comes to this class would have a couple of questions that they'd like to discuss. And if I can't answer them, maybe some others of you can. So I like to think of this as a super seminar, and normally, I don't prepare lectures. And I just start off asking if there are any questions. And if there are not, I get really pissed off. But anyway, I'm going to start with a series of slides. So why do we need machines?

There's a better list in a book by the Astronomer Royal Martin Rees of England. Anybody know the title? AUDIENCE: \"Our Final Hour.\" PROFESSOR: Yes, \"Our Final Hour.\" It's a slightly scary title.

So I assumed that the US had somehow made a big underwater tanker with 20,000 tons of TNT, and some few grams of radium or something, and blown it up in the harbor. And first, it flew an airplane over, dropping some little thing. And this was to fool the Japanese into thinking that we have an atomic bomb. But when they did it, again, over Nagasaki, that wasn't feasible. And when I was in grade school, Sometimes, if I said something very bright, I would hear a teacher saying, maybe he's another J.

Many years later when I was at Princeton in graduate school, I met the Robert Oppenheimer, and that was a great pleasure. And in fact, he took me to lunch with a couple of other people I admired, namely, Girdle and Einstein, which was very exciting. Except I couldn't understand Einstein, because I wasn't used to people with a strong German accent. But I understood Girdle just fine. And after that lunch was over, I went and spent about a year learning about Turing machines, and trying to prove theorems about them, and so forth.

But you really should read, just skim through some of that, and you'll find that this is a really smart guy. We don't know if he wrote this stuff, or if it were compiled by his students, like a lot of Feynman's writing is and Von Neumann's writing is edited from notes by their students.

Somewhere in the society mind, I think I quoted Lucretius about translucent objects. And he says, they have the particular appearance, because the rays of light bounce many times before they get to the surface. So you can't tell where they started. And I don't find in eastern philosophy theories that say, here's what, I think, and here's a reason why. I've looked at Buddhist stuff, and it's strange lists of psychological principles. Every one of which looks pretty wrong, and they make nice two dimensional diagrams. But no evidence for any of them, so I don't know whether to take it seriously.

It seems to me that science began a little bit in China, a little bit in India. In the Arabic world, they got up to the middle of high school algebra, but then-- AUDIENCE: That's the foundation. PROFESSOR: What? AUDIENCE: That's the foundation. PROFESSOR: Well, but it wasn't as good as Archimedes, who got to the beginning of calculus. So if you look at most cultures, they never got to the critical point of getting theories, doing experiments, discussing them, and then throwing them out. And so if you look at Buddhist philosophy, it's 2,500 years old. If you look at Greek physics, yes, Archimedes almost got calculus, and he got lots of nice principles.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: No, it's more-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Sure, OK. Do you have a theory of why science didn't develop for so long? In most cultures, it might be religion, which is a sort of science that doesn't use evidence, and in fact, kills people who try to get it. So there are systematic reasons why most cultures failed, and maybe somebody has written it. Is there a book on why science disappeared, except once? It's rather remarkable. Isn't it?

And she mentions that this was spread by rats and fleas or something. And 30% or 40% of the population of many countries in Europe died, and the next generation had a lot of furniture.

And they'll make it for about $0.50 or $1 per nucleotide. So for a couple of hundred dollars, you can make a virus or a few hundred. So one possibility is that some high school student makes some smallpox only gets it wrong, and it kills everyone. So there are lots of disasters like that, and no one knows what to do about that.

And there was a researcher who lived a few blocks from us whose dog had cancer. So its father-- I don't know what you call the owner of a dog. --sneaked some penicillin out of the lab and gave it to the dog, who died anyway. But he said, well, nobody's tried penicillin on cancer yet. Maybe it will work. And a lot of people were mad at him, because he probably cost some human its life.

And somebody mentioned that curve stopped the last few years for other reasons, but anyway, if you extrapolated, you'll find that the lifespan is going to keep increasing. How much we don't know-- another problem is that you might discover enough about genetics to get rid of most of the serious diseases. Maybe just 20 or 30 genes are responsible for most deaths right now. And if you could fix those, which we can't do yet, there's no way to change a gene in a person.

So anyway, I think it's very important that we get smart robots, because we're going to have to stem the population. And I hope people will live longer and blah, blah, blah. So these robots have to be smart enough to replace most people, and how do you make something smart? Well, artificial intelligence is the field whose goal with has been to make machines that do things that we regard as smart, or intelligent, or whatever you want to call it.

The first form of the general purpose computer appears really in the 1920s and '30 with the work of a mathematician, Emil Post at NYU, who I happen to never meet. But we had some friends in common, and he had the idea of production rules. And basically, rule based systems and prove various theorems about them. Then Kurt Girdle showed that, if you had something, like a computer or a procedure that had the right kinds of rules, it could compute all sorts of things. But there were some things it couldn't compute, unsolvable problems, and that became an exciting branch of mathematics. And the star thinker in that field was Alan Turing, who invented a very simple kind of universal general purpose computer. Instead of a random access memory, it just had a tape, which it could write on, and read, and change symbols. And it would go back and forth. And if it's in state x at, say, symbol y,", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " it will print symbol z over the x and move to the left or right and just a bunch of rules like that, where it was enough to make a universal computer.

And a couple of general purpose light computers, very simple ones, were built in the 1930s and more in the 1940s. And in the 1950s, big companies started to make big computers, which were rooms full of equipment. But as you know, most programs could only do some particular thing, and none of them were very smart. Whereas a human can handle lots of kinds of situations.

And the problem that I imagine that you're dealing with is this. My favorite example is I'm thirsty, so I see that glass of water. And I do that and get it. Actually, I am.

If you assume those are both chairs of the same size, and you know that this chair is about twice as far away as that, although, you don't-- well, and how far away they are pretty much by the absolute size. If you have two eyes that work well, then, if something is less than 30 feet away, you can make a pretty good estimate of its distance by focusing both eyes on some feature. And your brain can tell how far apart your eyes are looking, so there's 12 different things. It's more than you need. Lots of people are missing half of those.

See if you can think of an example, where a person has even more 12 of these. But it's pretty amazing, isn't it? It's more redundancy. This is too hard to read, but somehow, I found it in Aristotle essay the idea that you should represent things in multiple ways. You might describe a house.

The second one is a structural description, how it's made. And Aristotle says, which is the better description? And he dismisses the material one or the functional one is not rather the person who combines both in a single statement. And then I found a paragraph by Fineman, who says, every theoretical physicist who is any good knows six or seven different ways to represent exactly the same physics.

If you look at one of my favorite books, it weighs about 20 pounds. It's the book on the nervous system by Kandel and Schwartz. And the index to that book is quite a lot of pages long, and it mentions 400 different structures in the brain. So the brain is not like the-- well, I shouldn't make fun of the liver. Because for all I know, the liver has 400 different many processes for doing things. But the brain has distinguishable areas that seem to perform several hundred different functions. And with a microscope, at first, they all look pretty much the same. But if you look closely, you see slightly different patterns of how the most layers of the cortex of the brain, most", "start": 1980.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " parts of it have six layers, and each has a population of different kinds of cells. There are a lot of cross connections up and down and sideways to other. They're arranged in columns of between 400 and the 1,000 cells, and you have a couple of million of those. And there are lots of differences between the columns in different areas, and we know some of the functions. In most cases, we don't know much about how any of them actually work with the main exception of vision, where the functions of the cells in the visual cortex are fairly well understood at low levels. So we know how that part of the brain finds the edges and boundaries of different areas, and textures, and regions of the visual field. But we do not know even a little bit about how the brain recognizes something as a chair, and an overhead projector, and a CRT screen, and that sort of thing.

Now the first sort of things I was interested in was, in fact, how to simulate simple kinds of nerve cells. Because in the 1950s, there was about almost 100 years, really more like 50 years of science discovering things about neurons and nerve cells, the axons, and dendrites that they use to communicate with other neurons.

There was no oscilloscope yet, but there were very high gain galvanometers, which could detect pulses going along a nerve fiber.

And by 1920 or '30 with the cathode ray tube appearing mostly because of television, but it became possible to do a lot of neurophysiology by sticking needles in brains. The vacuum tube appears around 1900, and you can make amplifiers that can see millivolts and then microvolts. So in the beginning of the 20th century, there was lots of progress. By 1950, we knew a lot about the nervous system, but we still don't know much about how you learn something in the brain. It's quite clear that the things called synapses are involved. The connections between two neurons become better at conducting nerve impulses under some conditions, but no one", "start": 2250.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " knows how higher level knowledge is represented in the brain yet.

And in particular, there was a theory called k line's, knowledge lines, or something that came partly from me and partly from a couple of other researchers named David Waltz and Jordan Pollock. That's a sort of nice theory of how neural networks might remember higher level concepts. And for some reason, although that kind of work is from around 1980, which is 30 years ago, it has not hit the neuroscience community. So if you look at the emotion machine book or the society minded in Amazon, you might run across a review by a neurologist named Richard Restak, who says that Minsky makes up a lot of concepts, like K-lines, and micronemes, and stuff like that, that nobody's ever heard of.

What do you suppose is my reaction to that? Who is supposed to get the evidence? So it seems to me that there's a strange field in neuroscience, which is that it doesn't want new ideas, unless you've proved them. So I try to have conversations with them, but get somewhat tired of it. Anyway, in this course, I'm taking the opposite approach, which is that we don't want a theory of thinking.

I forget with the third one is. Oh, equal reaction is equal and opposite. If two things collide, they transfer equal amount of momentum to both. There was a little problem up to Newton's time.

Anyway, what's happened in artificial intelligence, like most fields, is that people said, well, let's try to understand thinking and psychology. And let's use physics as our model, so what we want is to get a very small number of universal laws. And a lot of psychologists struggled around to do that, and then they gradually separated. So that there were some psychologists, like Bill Estes, who worked out some very nice mathematical rules for reinforcement based learning, got a simple rule.

But they weren't good enough. So here's a whole list of things that happened in the early years of cognitive psychology when people were trying to make theories of thinking, and they were imitating the physicists.

Because if two of them are combined in something, like a exclusive or a manner, you know, I just put the light pen in a pocket. It's either in the left pocket or a right pocket. It can't be both. That's an x or. That will cause a lot of trouble to a learning machine. And if there are a hundreds variables, there's no way you could decide which of the two to the 100th Boolean combinations of those variables you should think about.

If any one of the variables is missing, there won't be any correlation of the phenomenon with the others. Anyway, that's a long story, but I think it's worth complaining about. Because almost all young people who start working on artificial intelligence look around and say, what's popular? Statistical learning, so I'll do that.

Well, I have three of my colleagues who aren't musical, but they dance. So they may-- it may be that-- I don't know the answer. It's interesting. The theory-- the first theory in my paper is that when you have a lot of complicated things happening, then the only way to learn is to represent things that happen, and then look at the differences between things that are similar, and then try to explain the differences, right? I mean, what else is there? Maybe there's something else. So in order to become intelligent and understand things, you have to be able to compare things. And to me, the most important feature of what's called music is that it's divided into measures-- bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bup, bah, bah. And measures are the same number of beats, or whatever they are.", "start": 6120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " And so now you can say da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

So you're taking things that were in different times, and you're superimposing those times. And now you can see the difference. And the reason you can see the difference is that you have things called measures. And the measures have things called beats. And so things get locked into very good frames. Now there's some Indian music which has 14 measures for a phrase. And some of the measures go seven and five. And I can make no sense of that stuff whatever. And I've tried fairly hard, but not very. So I don't understand how Indians can think. Any of you can handle Indian music?

Yeah, my friends who seem amusical, they probably-- maybe there's something different about their cochlea. Or maybe they have absolute pitch in some sense, which is a bad thing to have.

And if you're-- and the opposite would be true. I read music criticism sometimes. And maybe the reviewer says, and after the second and third movement, he finally returns to the initial key of E flat major-- what a relief.

It's a set of sensors from which our brains can get information about the world, and instead of actuators, in which we can display our state. So in that light, it's almost as if our brains are really independent on our body itself. It can adapt to any sort of body if we happen to hook it up that way. And it just so happens that we've been hooked up to this body since birth, that we have such good mental models of how to use this body. And I guess an example of-- from experiments that support this theory might be how, when people have limbs amputated, it takes them a while to forget that they have the limb.

Let's say three. So when you put a certain input, it goes from-- couldn't find the chalk. So here are three states. And here's a certain input that means if you're in that state, you go to this.

In other words, imagine that there's a little world inside your brain, which is very small and only has three states. And you have actions that you can perform on it. And you have an inner eye which can see which of the three points of that triangle you're on. Then you could learn, by experience, that if you go left, left, left, you're back where you were. But if you go left, right, left, right, you're back where you are. And if you go left, left, right, that's like going one left. In other words, you could imagine a brain that starts out-- before it connects itself to the real world, it starts by having the top level of the brain connected to a little internal world which just has three or four states.
