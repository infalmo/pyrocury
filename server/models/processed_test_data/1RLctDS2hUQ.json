F(a).That's it.That's the whole theorem.And you may recognize it.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Before, we had the\nnotation that Fwas the antiderivative,\nthat is, capital Fwas the integral of f(x).We wrote it this way.This is this\nindefinite integral.And now we're putting\nin definite values.And we have a connection\nbetween the twouses of the integral sign.But with the definite\nvalues, we get real numbersout instead of a function.Or a function up to a constant.So this is it.This is the formula.And it's usually also written\nwith another notation.So I want to introduce that\nnotation to you as well.So there's a new notation here.Which you'll find\nvery convenient.Because we don't always\nhave to give a letter fto the functions involved.So it's an abbreviation.For right now there'll be\na lot of f's, but anyway.So here's the abbreviation.Whenever I have a difference\nbetween a function at twovalues, I also can\nwrite this as F(x)with an a down here\nand a b up there.So that's the\nnotation that we use.And you can also, for\nemphasis, and this sometimesturns out to be important, when\nthere's more than one variablefloating around in the problem.To specify that\nthe variable is x.So this is the same\nthing as x = a.And x = b.It indicates where\nyou want to plug in,what you want to plug in.And now you take the top\nvalue minus the bottom value.So F(b) - F(a).So this is just a notation, and\nin that notation, of course,the theorem can be written\nwith this set of symbols here.Equally well.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.133}, {"text": "So let's just give a\ncouple of examples.The first example\nis the one that wedid last time very laboriously.If you take the function F(x),\nwhich happens to be x^3 / 3,then if you differentiate\nit, you get, well,the the factor of 3 cancels.So you get x^2,\nthat's the derivative.And so by the\nfundamental theorem,so this implies by the\nfundamental theorem,that the integral from say, a to\nb of x^3 over - sorry, x^2 dx,that's the derivative here.This is the function we're\ngoing to use as f(x) here -is equal to this function\nhere, F(b) - F(a), that's here.This function here.So that's F(b) - F(a), and\nthat's equal to b^3 / 3 -a^3 / 3.Now, in this new\nnotation, we usuallydon't have all of these letters.All we write is the following.We write the\nintegral from a to b,and I'm going to\ndo the case 0 to b,because that was the one that\nwe actually did last time.So I'm going to set a = 0 here.And then, the problem we\nwere faced last time as this.And as I said we did\nit very laboriously.But now you can see that we\ncan do it in ten seconds,let's say.Well, the antiderivative\nof this is x^3 / 3.I'm going to evaluate it\nat 0 and at b and subtract.So that's going to\nbe b^3 / 3 -

x(a) Exactly.The other one is approximate.OK, again this is\ncalled a Riemann sum.All right, so that's the intro\nto the fundamental theorem.And now what I need to do\nis extend it just a bit.And the way I'm going to\nextend it is the following.I'm going to do it on\nthis example first.And then we'll do\nit more formally.So here's this example\nwhere we went someplace.But now I just want to draw\nyou an additional picture here.Imagine I start here\nand I go over to thereand then I come back.And maybe even I\ndo a round trip.I come back to the same place.Well, if I come back\nto the same place,", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.257}, {"text": "then the position is unchanged\nfrom the beginning to the end.In other words, the\ndifference is 0.And the velocity, technically\nrather than the speed.It's the speed to the right\nand the speed to the leftmaybe are the same,\nbut one of themis going in the positive\ndirection and one of themis going in the\nnegative direction,and they cancel each other.So if you have this\nkind of situation,we want that to be reflected.We like that\ninterpretation and wewant to preserve it even\nwhen-- in the case whenthe function v is negative.And so I'm going to now extend\nour notion of integration.So we'll extend integration\nto the case f negative.Or positive.In other words, it\ncould be any sign.Actually, there's no change.The formulas are all the same.We just-- If this v is\ngoing to be positive,we write in a positive number.If it's going to be negative,\nwe write in a negative number.And we just leave it alone.And the real-- So here's--\nLet me carry out an exampleand show you how it works.I'll carry out the example\non this blackboard up here.Of the sine function.But we're going\nto try two humps.We're going to try the\nfirst hump and the one thatgoes underneath.There.So our example here is\ngoing to be the integralfrom 0 to 2pi of sin x dx.And now, because the fundamental\ntheorem is so important, and souseful, and so\nconvenient, we justassume that it be true\nin this case as well.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.355}, {"text": "So we insist that this is going\nto be -cos x, evaluated at 0and 2pi, with the difference.Now, when we carry\nout that difference,what we get here is\n-cos 2pi -

In other words,I lied to you before when I said\nthat the definite integral wasthe area under the curve.It's not.The definite\nintegral is the areaunder the curve when\nit's above the curve,and it counts negatively\nwhen it's below the curve.So yesterday, my geometric\ninterpretation was incomplete.And really just a plain lie.So the true geometric\ninterpretationof the definite integral\nis plus the areaabove the axis,\nabove the x-axis,minus the area below the x-axis.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.433}, {"text": "As in the picture.I'm just writing\nit down in words,but you should think\nof it visually also.So that's the setup here.And now we have the complete\ndefinition of integrals.And I need to list for you\na bunch of their propertiesand how we deal with integrals.So are there any\nquestions before we go on?Yeah.STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Right.So the question was,\nwouldn't the absolute valueof the velocity\nfunction be involved?The answer is yes.That is, that's one\nquestion that you could ask.One question you\ncould ask is what'sthe total distance traveled.And in that case,\nyou would keep trackof the absolute value of\nthe velocity as you said,whether it's\npositive or negative.And then you would get the\ntotal length of this curve here.That's, however, not what the\ndefinite integral measures.It measures the net\ndistance traveled.So it's another thing.In other words, we can do that.We now have the\ntools to do both.We could also-- So if you\nlike, the total distanceis equal to the\nintegral of this.From a to b.But the net distance is the\none without the absolute valuesigns.So that's correct.Other questions?", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.233}, {"text": "All right.So now, let's talk about\nproperties of integrals.So the properties of integrals\nthat I want to mention to youare these.The first one doesn't\nbear too much comment.If you take the cumulative\nintegral of a sum,you're just trying to get the\nsum of the separate integralshere.And I won't say much about that.That's because sums come\nout, the because the integralis a sum.Incidentally, you know\nthis strange symbol here,there's actually a reason\nfor it historically.If you go back to\nold books, you'llsee that it actually looks\na little bit more like an S.This capital sigma is a sum.S for sum, because\neverybody in those daysknew Latin and Greek.And this one is also\nan S, but gradually itwas such an important S\nthat they made a bigger.And then they stretched it out\nand made it a little thinner,because it didn't fit into\none typesetting space.And so just for typesetting\nreasons it got stretched.And got a little bit skinny.Anyway, so it's really an\nS.

can\nfactor constants out of sums.So if you have an integral like\nthis, the constant factors out.But definitely don't try to\nget a function out of this.That won't happen.OK, in other words, c\nhas to be a constant.Doesn't depend on x.The third property.What do I want to call\nthe third property here?I have sort of a preliminary\nproperty, yes, here.Which is the following.And I'll draw a picture of it.I suppose you have three\npoints along a line.So then I'm going to\ndraw a picture of that.And I'm going to use the\ninterpretation above the curve,even though that's\nnot the whole thing.So here's a, here's\nb and here's c.And you can see that\nthe area of this piece,of the first two pieces\nhere, when added together,gives you the area of the whole.And that's the rule that\nI'd like to tell you.So if you integrate\nfrom a to b, and youadd to that the\nintegral from b to c,you'll get the\nintegral from a to c.This is going to be just\na little preliminary,because the rule is a\nlittle better than this.But I will explain\nthat in a minute.The fourth rule is\na very simple one.Which is that the integral\nfrom a to a of f(x) dxis equal to 0.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.186}, {"text": "Now, that you can see very\nobviously because there'sno area.No horizontal movement there.The rectangle is\ninfinitely thin,and there's nothing there.So this is the case.You can also interpret\nit a F(a) - F(a).So that's also consistent\nwith our interpretation.In terms of the fundamental\ntheorem of calculus.And it's perfectly reasonable\nthat this is the case.Now, the fifth property\nis a definition.It's not really a property.But it's very important.The integral from a to b of f(x)\ndx equal to minus the integralfrom b to a, of f( x) dx.Now, really, the right-hand side\nhere is an undefined quantityso far.We never said you\ncould ever do thiswhere the a is less than the b.Because this is\nworking backwards here.But we just have a convention\nthat that's the definition.Whenever we write\ndown this number,it's the same as minus\nwhat that number is.And the reason for\nall of these is againthat we want them to be\nconsistent with the fundamentaltheorem of calculus.Which is the thing that\nmakes all of this work.So if you notice the left-hand\nside here is F(b) - F(a),capital F, the\nantiderivative of little f.On the other hand, the\nother side is minus,and if we just ignore that,\nwe say these are letters,if we were a machine, we didn't\nknow which one was bigger thanwhich, we just plugged them in,\nwe would get here F(a) - F(b),over here.And to make these two\nthings equal, what we wantis to put that minus sign in.Now it's consistent.So again, these\nrules are set up so", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.201}, {"text": "that everything is consistent.And now I want to\nimprove on rule 3 here.And point out to you - so\nlet me just go back to rule 3for a second - that now that\nwe can evaluate integralsregardless of the order, we\ndon't have to have a < b,b < c in order to make\nsense out of this.We actually have the possibility\nof considering integralswhere the a's and the\nb's and the c's arein any order you want.And in fact,

here.Because otherwise, all of our\nformulas are going to mess up.We won't always\nbe able to check.Sometimes you have\nletters rather thanactual numbers here,\nand you won't knowwhether a is bigger than b.So you'll want to know that\nthese formulas work and areconsistent in all situations.OK, I'm going to\ntrade these again.In order to preserve the\nordering 1 through 5.And now I have a sixth property\nthat I want to talk about.This one is called estimation.", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.134}, {"text": "And it says the following.If f(x) <= g(x), then the\nintegral from a to b of f(x) dxis

have a < b.You need it.Because we flip the signs when\nwe flip the order of a and b.So this one, it's essential\nthat the lower limit be smallerthan the upper limit.But let me just emphasize,\nbecause we're dealingwith the generalities of this.Actually if one of\nthese is negativeand the other one is\nnegative, then it also works.This one ends up being, if\nf is more negative than g,then this added up thing is\nmore negative than that one.Again, under the assumption\nthat a is less than b.So as I wrote it it's\nin full generality.Let's illustrate this one.And then we have one more\nproperty to learn after that.So let me give you an\nexample of estimation.The example is the same as\none that I already gave you.", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "But this time, because we\nhave the tool of integration,we can just follow our\nnoses and it works.I start with the\ninequality, so I'mtrying to illustrate\nestimation, so Iwant to start with\nan inequality whichis what the hypothesis is here.And I'm going to\nintegrate the inequalityto get this conclusion.And see what conclusion it is.The inequality that I want\nto take is that e^x >= 1,for x >= 0.That's going to be\nour starting place.And now I'm going\nto integrate it.That is, I'm going\nto use estimationto see what that gives.Well, I'm going to\nintegrate, say, from 0 to b.I can't integrate below 0\nbecause it's only true above 0.This is e^x dx greater than or\nequal to the integral from 0to b of 1 dx.Alright, let's work out\nwhat each of these is.The first one, e^x dx, is,\nthe antiderivative is e^x,evaluated at 0 and b.So that's e^b - e^0.Which is e^b - 1.The other one,\nyou're supposed to beable to get by\nthe rectangle law.This is one rectangle\nof base b and height 1.So the answer is b.Or you can do it by\nantiderivatives, but it's b.That means that our inequality\nsays if I just combine thesetwo things together,\nthat e^b - 1 >= b.And that's the same\nthing as e^b >= 1 + b.", "start": 1920.0,

to just\nrepeat this process.So let's repeat it.Starting from the\ninequality, the conclusion,which is sitting right here.But I'll write it in a form\ne^x >= 1 + x, for x >= 0.And now, if I\nintegrate this one,I get the integral from 0 to b,\ne^x dx is greater than or equalto the integral from\n0 to b, (1 + x) dx,and I remind you that we've\nalready calculated this one.This is e^b - 1.And the other one is\nnot hard to calculate.The antiderivative\nis x + x^2 / 2.We're evaluating\nthat at 0 and b.So that comes out\nto be b + b^2 / 2.And so our conclusion is that\nthe left side, which is e^b -1 >=

e^b.So that's it for the\nbasic properties.Now there's one tricky property\nthat I need to tell you about.It's not that tricky,\nbut it's a little tricky.And this is change of variables.Change of variables\nin integration,we've actually already done.We called that, the last\ntime we talked about it,we called it substitution.And the idea here,\nif you may remember,was that if you're faced\nwith an integral like this,you can change it to, if you put\nin u = u(x) and you have a du,which is equal to\nu'(x) du-- dx, sorry.Then you can change the\nintegral as follows.This is the same as\ng(u(x))

limits over here\nare in the same relationshipas u(x) is to this\nsymbol u here.In other words, u_1 =\nu(x_1), and u_2 = u(x_2).That's what works.Now there's only\none danger here,there's one subtlety\nwhich is, this only worksif u' does not change sign.I've been worrying a little\nbit about going backwardsand forwards, and\nI allowed myselfto reverse and do all\nkinds of stuff, right,with these integrals.So we're sort of free to do it.Well, this is one case where\nyou want to avoid it, OK?Just don't do it.It is possible, actually,\nto make sense out of it,but it's also possible to

where you're worrying\nabout the sign change,the right strategy is,\nwhat you suggested works.And in fact I'm going to\ndo an example right nowon this subject.But, the right strategy is\nto break it up into pieces.Where u' has one sign\nor the other, OK?Let me show you an example.Where things go wrong.And I'll tell you how\nto handle it, roughly.So here's our warning.Suppose you're integrating\nfrom -1 to 1, x^2 dx.Here's an example.And you have the temptation\nto plug in u = x^2.Now, of course, we know\nhow to integrate this.But let's just pretend we\nwere stubborn and wantedto use substitution.Then we have du = 2x dx.And now if I try to\nmake the correspondence,notice that the limits\nare u_1 = (-1)^2,that's the bottom limit.And u_2 is the upper limit.That's 1^2, that's\nalso equal to 1.Both limits are 1.So this is going from 1 to 1.And no matter what it is,\nwe know it's going to be 0.But we know this is not 0.This is the integral\nof a positive quantity.And the area under a curve is\ngoing to be a positive area.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.443}, {"text": "So this is a positive quantity.It can't be 0.If you actually plug it in,\nit looks equally strange.You put in here this u and then,\nso that would be for the u^2.And then to plug in for dx,\nyou would write dx = 1/(2x) du.And then you might\nwrite that as this.And so what I should put in\nhere is this quantity here.Which is a perfectly\nOK integral.And it has a value, I\nmean, it's what it is.It's 0.So of course this is not true.And the reason is that\nu was equal to x^2,and u'(x) was equal to 2x, which\nwas positive for x positive,and negative for x negative.And this was the sign change\nwhich causes us trouble.If we break it off into its\ntwo halves, then it'll be OKand you'll be able to use this.Now, there was a mistake.And this was essentially\nwhat you were saying.That is, it's possible to see\nthis happening as you're doingit if you're very careful.There's a mistake\nin this process,and the mistake is\nin the transition.This is a mistake here.Maybe I haven't used\nany red yet today,so I get to use some red here.Oh boy.This is not true, here.This step here.So why isn't it true?It's not true for\nthe standard reason.Which is that really, x = plus\nor minus square root of u.And if you stick to\none side or the other,you'll have a coherent\nformula for it.One of them will be the plus and\none of them will be the minusand it will work out when you\nseparate it into its pieces.", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.41}, {"text": "So you could do that.But this is a can of worms.So I avoid this.And just do it in a place where\nthe inverse is well defined.And where the\nfunction either movessteadily up or steadily down.", "start": 2880.0, "heat": 0.439}]
