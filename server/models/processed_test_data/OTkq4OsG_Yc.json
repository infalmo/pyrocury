this is going to be\nMonday, Wednesday, Fridayfrom 3:30 to 5:00.I just got a room for a\nreview session on Tuesday,Thursday for anyone who needs\nto catch up a little bit.The class is here, 4370.I'm Kevin Desmond.I'm going to be the instructor.Paul Mende is the\nfaculty advisor.And this is worth\nthree H credits.The game play aspect--\nso this is what I did.And I think this is really cool.So Poker Stars gave us our own\nprivate league for only MITpeople in this course.And my goal here is\nto separate peoplewho are fairly new from people\nwho are very competitive,because I don't want someone not\nto pass the course because theyhappen to be not\nthat great at poker.So I created this thing\ncalled the Beginners' League.And these are going\nto be Daily Turbos.Turbos means they're\nfast-ish tournaments.And to get the game play\ncredit, you can cash,you can make money\nin one of them,or you can play in 10 of them.So those who are struggling\ncan get this game play creditby playing 10 tournaments, which\nis about a 10-hour commitment.Let's go into the\ngame play aspect more.So Poker Stars created\nthis private league for us,which is really cool.So Poker Stars is generally\nconsidered the most reputableonline poker site.That's why we use them.So they have two\ndifferent types of games.So they have real money\nand play money games.Now if you're in the US,\nyou can't do real money.It used to be something\nthat was very gray area.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.193}, {"text": "And then there was one\npoker site which turned outto be legitimately like a\nPonzi scheme, and as a result,now poker in the US is like\nmuch more black and white,definitely not OK\nfor real money.However, their play money\nscene is pretty resilient,and that's what we're\ntaking advantage of here.The Poker Stars play\nmoney scene is broken downinto two different things.They have public games, where\nyou can just go and playfor play chips against anyone\nin the world, which is cool.And you can do that,\nand I recommendyou give it a shot just to\nget used to the software.In addition, you\ncould do home games,which is what we're\ngenerally going to be doing.That's what they call\ntheir private leagues.So in the private leagues,\nin their home games,they have this showcase.And you might notice\nas soon as you log inthat the MIT League, Poker\nTheory and Analytics,is already at the top.That's not just for us.That's for everyone.Anyone in the world who\nlogs into Poker Starsand looks at home games\nhas the MIT Leagueat the top, which I\nthink is really cool.So to access this, I'll send\na more specific instructionslater.I gave you guys just the\npasscode of what you need.But to actually get\nthere, what you need to dois, you log into Poker Stars.You go to this button,\nwhich is a little house,to access home games.And then you want\nto join a game.And what you do is, you put\nthe Club ID, which is 557832.You put the invitation\ncode, which you're allgoing to have on Stellar.And then you put your real\nname, preferably the one that'slisted in the course,\nbecause I actuallyhave to approve everyone\nthat joins the league,and I can't do it just based\non someone's screen name.And I guess you have to\nagree to some sort of termsand conditions.So let's talk\nabout hand history.So a lot of analytics\nare going to be based offof hand histories, which are\njust text files that PokerStars gives you to the extent\nthat you indicate that you wantto save them down.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.151}, {"text": "So these are kind of\njumbled messes of text.Each line just shows\none thing that happens.And you might get\nused to reading it,or might not,\ndepending on how muchyou're going to scrutinize it.But more importantly,\nyou can usethese in all the data\nanalytic programsthat we're going to use.In particular, Poker\nTracker runs off of that.You'll load just thousands\nof hands into Poker Tracker,and it'll do analytics for you.It knows exactly what's going on\nbased on that format, which isgenerally considered universal.And then for the sake of\nvisualizing these hands--if you just read\nit, that's fine.But then if you want\nto show other people,I'm recommending we use\nsomething called the UniversalHand History Replayer, which\nis something that's free.And what it does, it just reads\nthe hands, and it plays them.It animates what happened as\nif you were seeing it for real.So the deal with\nhand histories is,if you're a real money player,\nPoker Stars dedicates databasesof hand histories so\nthat, if you want,you can request all your\nhand histories at any time.For play money players, they\nlet you capture your own handhistories if you want, but they\ndefinitely don't save them.So the reason I'm\nshowing you this now,and I'm going to email\nit out to you later,is if you lose your\nhand histories,so you don't capture\nthem in time,you'll never get them back.So make sure you're actually\ncapturing hand histories,because we're going to be using\nthat for a lot of the analysiswe do.OK, so let's talk\nabout the league.And honestly, I\nthink this leagueis going to be really cool.Usually the\nevolution of a playeris they're terrible at\npoker, and then theystart becoming good at\nplaying against bad people.And then when they actually\nstart playing for real,they get crushed\nagain because they'reused to playing against\nother bad people.So this will actually\nhopefully getyou used to playing\nagainst other people whoare playing correctly, which is\nnot something you can commonly", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.103}, {"text": "learn just from playing\naround with your friends.In addition through playing\nin these online leagues,you can collect stats\nthat you could neverget from playing live.And I think this is why the\nlive tournament scene isdominated by online pros.It's because no live pro\ncan get as many handsor analyze their play in the\nway that you can do online.It's not even comparable.So this is given-- even if your\nwhole intention is to only playlive the entire rest your life,\ndoing this type of analyticswould give you a chance to\nlearn at a much faster rateand learn things that\nyou would never see live.So every week we're going to\nhave a major tournament, whichis basically going to be\nthe same structure, maybea little bit slower, than\nthe ones we do daily,except they're going\nto have real prizes.So Akuna is giving us, for\ntheir first tournament,Beats headphones.And Apple TV, Bose speakers\nand a lot of gift cards.And then for their\nsecond tournament,they're giving us\nall of those thingsplus an iPad Air\nand an iPad Mini.But we're not done yet.Because this class is\nfocused on playing live,we're going to end the\nclass with a live tournamentsponsored by Optiver\non the 31st, whichis the day after the\nlast day of the class.So after the league's\nover, and after youguys are good at poker,\nyou'll have an opportunityto play each other in a live\ntournament, where their prizepool is all of the Akuna\nprizes, plus a PlayStation4, plus an iPad, plus a\nKindle, and plus a GoPro.I want this to reflect\nthe type of things", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "an online, multi-table\ntournament player would do.How it normally works is,\nduring the week, and basicallyevery single day, there\nis a uniform amountof tournaments that will\njust run every single dayat the top of the hour.And these pros will\njust grind those out.They'll get used\nto the structure.And that's where they'll\nkind of grind their teeth.And then on the\nweekends, that's whenyou get a lot of the square\nmoney, a lot of the newer guyswho only play poker\non the weekend.And those are more gimmicky,\nidiosyncratic tournaments,but also the highest value.So that's why I'm producing the\ntournament structure like this,where the bulk of\nyour tournamentswill be very similar\nto each other.But then the tournaments\nthat really matterwill be completely different,\nat least relatively different.So that's why I'm doing that.That'll make you\nget a feel for whatthese guys have to go through.So let's talk about turbos.Turbos let you focus on\npre-flop decisions, whichare the area where I\nthink there is the mostto learn among people\nwho are new at poker.Basically, all of\nyour value that you'relosing in tournament is\nfrom screwing up pre-flop.No one gets that right live\nbecause it's really difficultto be able to feel comfortable\ndoing what's generallyconsidered right.And we're going to spend\na lot of time on pre-flop.But these turbos encourage\nyou to do that sort of thing,because live is a\nlot of pre-flop,and you're going to be doing\nthat in the turbos online, too.In addition, no\none wants to spendsix hours doing a tournament.So I'm making these\nturbos so you canbe in and out in 45 minutes.And then you boot up\nanother tournament,or you can be done with\npoker for that night.In addition, you have\nthe opportunity--you can play as many\ntournaments as you want.It's common for pros to do\nsomething called multi-tabling", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "which is they'll do multiple\ntournaments at the same time.For the beginners, I'd probably\nrecommend you just do one.But for the regular\nleague, have at that.you want to do like all four\ntournaments at the same time,go ahead, to the extent\nthat they overlapwith each other a little bit.OK.So that's the end\nwith the prize league.So the schedule is, we're\ngoing to go through whatI'm calling basic\nstrategy, whichare the basic axioms that we're\ngoing to be using in orderto analyze the decision\nmaking process in poker.Then we're going to be\ndoing pre-flop analysis.And we're going to be doing\na lot of this, because thisis really where the\nvalue add is going to be,is getting this right.I think the way\nthat we can tacklethis thing is kind of a\nway I recommend that youlearn anything complicated.So we're going to\nbreak this downinto three different sections.Fundamental concept, practice,\nwhich are actually implementingthose concepts when you have\n10 seconds to make a decision,and then more advanced stuff.With regard to\nconcepts, I'm goingto call this the basic\nframework for decision making.It's being unexploitable.You want to get to the level\nwhen you sit down at a table,every pro in the room\ndoesn't turn and go,I want to sit at\nthat guy's table.You want to be a\nslightly winning playerway before you want to\nbecome a huge winning player.In order to let you\nknow the type of thingthat we're learning, I'm going\nto label the slides with this,to indicate that this\nis like a basic concept.Learn this thing\nbefore you move on.The advanced stuff\nis, once you learnhow to do things-- which how\nto do things is pretty broad--", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "we're going to learn minor\nadjustments that we can doto get quite a bit\nof extra money,like how to grind out that\nadditional half big blindan hour out of our opponents.So any real deviations\nfrom what we normallydo, in addition to meta game.Meta game is always\nfun, like anythingnot related to the\nhand to hand decisionmaking process, like\ntable selection,or bankroll\nmanagement, or decidingwhether or not to play.That stuff is really\nfun, and that'sto be indicated\nby this ace here.OK.So I'm going to label those\nslides for anything that'sconsidered advanced, and stuff\nyou should only really dowhen you get the concepts down.And then a lot of\nthis class is goingto be focused on practice, which\nis how to actually implementthese concepts on a day to\nday basis when you're actuallyplaying, especially live.We are not going to have\nall the information.We're not going to\nhave calculators,and we're not going to have that\nmuch time to make a decision.So how to apply these in real\ntime, making rules of thumb,figuring out what\nyou can just ignoreand what you have\nto definitely do,and then some the\npsychology stuff relatedto actually performing\nlive is goingto be what I'm calling\npractice, whichis going to be indicated by\nthat poker chip with a P in it.Let's talk about what I'm\nbringing to the table here.So this course is\nprimarily goingto be from my perspective.And the decisions about what\nI'm going to teach you here,and the value calls\nI'm making, isgoing to come from what I\nconsider the appropriate wayfor someone to play poker.So my background is that I\nwas an online multi-table", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "tournament grinder, not\nbecause I was a great pro,but because I sat\nmore than I played.I was definitely a\nperson who did notplay every single tournament.I told you the World\nSeries of Pokerhas like 25 different\ntournaments.10 are Texas Hold'em.And then they have an Omaha\ntournament, and a horsetournament, which is\na combination of fivedifferent games.And what is common is\nthat any pro who plays oneplays them all.I consider that ridiculous\nfor someone who's actuallyinterested in making any sort of\nmoney or career playing poker.So I'm definitely someone\nwho prefers identifyingvalue and monetizing it.So anyway, that's\nthe perspectivethat I'm going to be\nteaching this course from.I like ROI.It's a great efficiency metric.Usually you try to maximize\nyour ROI up until the pointwhere it's below\nsome sort of hourlythat you set for\nyourself, because oneof the ways you supplement ROI\nis by moving down in stakes.Usually lower stakes\nare easier games.You should have a\nhigher win rate.But that win rate's multiplied\nby a much lower number.So usually you're going to move\naround in stakes until you havea good ROI, but hopefully above\nwhat you consider your lowestamount that you can feel\ncomfortable earning.In addition, I want to\nfocus on live tournamentsbecause who knows what's\ngoing to happen to online?Whereas I think live\ntournaments are very social,they're very public.Everyone knows who\nwins live tournaments.So I'm going to teach in\na way such that focuseson these types of values.OK.So let's move on to some\nof the concepts and toolsthat we're going to learn.So we're done learning about\nwhat we're actually going", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "to be doing during this class.So let's learn a\nlittle bit about poker.So first thing is, we're going\nto be using PokerTracker a lot.So I'm going to\nemail out exactlyhow to install this thing.PokerTracker has\ndonated 115 licensesto their product for us.And then our next\nlesson, on Wednesday,is going to be Joel\nFried teaching ushow to use this thing and going\nthrough some of the analytics.So one other thing\nthat I like usingis the Universal Replayer.And what this thing does is it\njust visualizes hand histories.So you'll feed it a hand\nhistory in a text file.It animates it.It probably does other\nthings, but it's free.And this thing's been\naround for a while.I've not even sure if\nit's supported anymore.But it's a thing\nthat I'm used to.So this is what it looks like.So you give it a\nhand, and then itreproduces what you might\nhave seen if you actuallyplayed that hand.So let's move on to a concept.So stack size.So this might seem\nfairly simple,but we ought to make sure we're\ntalking about the same thingwhen we go through this.So your stack size,\nit's the valueof the chips in front of you.So that's fairly normal.But we have this thing called\neffective stack size, whichis what we're usually going to\nbe talking about when we referto stack, which is the\nminimum of your stackor the next biggest\nstack after you.And the way to\nthink about this isthe number of chips you could\npossibly lose in this one hand.That's what your\nrelevant stack size is.And the way you make decisions\nwill depend on your effectivestack much more\nthan anything else.So an example of\nthis would be, sayyou're in a heads up situation\nwhere you're the hero here", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "on the small blind.Big blind has,\nwhatever, 300 chips.And you have some amount\nof chips with queens.So if you have 1,500\nchips, and so doeshe-- say blinds are like 10/20--\nyou have, what, like 50 timesthe blinds combined here.So this is a pretty\ndifferent hand than aces.Why?So say that you raise with\nqueens, and then he raises you.So you raise to 60, he raises\nyou to 200, you raise to 600,and he pushes to 1,500.Your queens are probably not\nreally that good anymore.It matters how many\nchips you have here.However, if you have 300\nchips, you raise with queens,and then he pushes over,\nyou can't fold that.You might as well have aces,\nand it makes your hands,the way you play hands,\nmaterially different.That's why chip size\nmatters in general.When the chip stack\nis low, you'replaying these two hands\nbasically identical.You're saying-- you're\njust playing this range.However, when we're talking\nabout effective chip stack,it's the same thing, where\neven if you have 1,500and he has 300, if you\nraise, he's going to push.You don't have the opportunity\nto do that back and forthanymore.So you might as well\nhave 300 with regardto your decision making here.That's why we're looking\nat the effective stack,because it really matters who\nhas the least number of chips,because that determines when\nthe action is going to be over.So really, I like this\ndefinition the most,", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "the most amount of chips that\nyou can lose in the hand.It's a lot more, I think,\nsimple to think aboutthan this min formula.OK.And then we're almost always\ntalking about effective stack.Let's talk about Dan Harrington.So Dan Harrington is a player\nwhose style I very much like.His nickname's Action\nDan, which the consensusis, he just kind of gave\nhimself, because he'sconsidered Mr. Fundamental, like\ntight aggressive ABC player.So this playing style, this\ntemperament, tight aggressive,is something that is used to\ncharacterize basic playingstyles.So let's quickly go\nthrough what those are.So there are two\ndifferent axes here.There's how often\nyou bet, where betmeans you are\nraising the stakes,so either you bet or you raise.And then here's\nhow often you call.Either you call a lot or\nyou call not that much.You can get a good feel for\nthe type of person someoneis by what box they fill in.So these have names.So someone who's\ntight aggressive,you would just refer\nto them as Tag, whichis like what Dan Harrington is.You bet when you have\ngood hands and youfold when you have bad hands.Another possibly winning\nstrategy is loose aggressive,Lag, where you certainly bet\nwhen you have good hands,but you will see a lot\nof cards before you'llgive up on a hand.You're definitely\nwilling to call a lot.These, type passive, are\nnot pronounceable words,so the community generally\ncame up with different wordsto describe these.So a tight passive\nperson is weak.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "They're someone who you\ncan completely run over,because they fold when\nthey have a bad hand,they check when they\nhave a good hand.I guess they would\nbe called rocks.You never need to worry about\nhaving a big losing nightagainst these guys.So someone who's type\npassive is generallyconsidered playing\nsub-optionally.And then the loose\npassive peopleare described-- this icon,\nwhich I forget what it's from.I think it might be from an\nold version of PokerTracker,or maybe it was on Party\nPoker or something.But everyone loved\nseeing this icon whichyou could label people as,\nbecause a loose passive personis what?They are a calling machine.That's what that\nstands for, and itmeans that when you\nhave a hand, theywill call all of your bets.You will extract\nvalue out of them.But when they have\na hand, they'reOK with letting you\nlook at your drawsto make a decision about whether\nby the river you have a handor not.There's virtually no\nway that these guysare making money in poker.I think it would be, like\nover a realistic sample size,there's no type of player who\ncould fit in this quadrantand be good enough on any\nother metric to actuallybe making money in poker.So in general how\nwe look at this is,we would call this\nTag guy solid ABC.That's what I'm recommending\nyou guys play as.Tag players, as a\nquadrant, are goingto be the biggest winners.Lag players, someone\nwho's very aggressiveand plays a lot of\nhands, could possiblybe a pretty good winner.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "It depends on the\ntype of game, and thentheir opponent and their\nability to pick spots.But there are a lot\nof big Lag winners.There are not a lot\nof big weak winners.And there are not\na lot of callingmachines, loose passive\nplayers, who are not big losers.So anytime you see-- this is\na definition of someone who'sa complete fish, a huge\ndonater to the game.And your ability to\nrecognize this type of thingwill help you find\ngood games to play,when you see someone\ndoing this kind of thing.Anyway, back to Action Dan.So Dan Harrington is a\npretty good poker player.He's been around the block.He won the main event\nback in 1995, when it had,like, 300 people in it.He has two World Series of Poker\nbracelets and one World PokerTour title.But anyway, so\nHarrington popularizedthis thing called\nthe M-ratio, whichwas invented by someone else.So the M-ratio was invented by\nthis guy Paul Magriel, who'sa backgammon theorist,\napparently one of the bestbackgammon players in the\nworld, commentator for the WSOB,World Series of Backgammon,\nand eight WSOB final tables.Anyway, so he's supposedly\nreally, really goodat math, even by MIT standards.But he invented this\nthing called the M-ratio,but then it never caught\non until Harringtonstarted doing it.All right, so\nHarrington's M-ratiois your effective stack\ndivided by the sumof the blinds and the empties.So you'll hear\npeople talk about,like, oh, I had 10 big blinds,\nor 15 big blinds or whatever,to talk about their chip stack.But that has a\nfundamental problem.It has a lot of\ndifferent problems.One is, it doesn't\ntell the story.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So the usual blind levels\nare like 1/2 or 2/4,where the big blind is\njust twice the small blind.So that's the assumption.But if you're at a blind\nlevel that's like 1/3 or 3/5,the number of big\nblinds you have is notindicative of anything.It's not indicative of how\nmany hands you can see,or how much you care about\nwinning a pot pre-flop.So using the blinds\nis bad, in additionto, once you start having,\nlike, if you're 50/100 blindsand you have an ante of 25, you\nhave basically half the stackyou had before, in\nrealistic terms.Just to get big blinds doesn't,\nin fact, earn antes at all.And that's a major problem\nreferring to it like that.So using M seems to\nmake a lot more sense.So what it is, is it's basically\nthe percentage of your stackthat is the blinds in the ante.So it's like how\nmany rounds of pokeryou can survive if you just\nfold every single hand.Of course, you're\nnot going to do that.Although I think that's what\nhe's actually getting at,because he uses M to\nrefer to when you haveto make a move, which is not\ngenerally how I recommendyou do it.I think it's more important,\nbecause it means how importantthe blinds are to your stack.The only reason anyone\nplays any hand of pokeris because someone\nwants to win the blind.So even if you have\nkings, to some extent,if you could win the\nblinds, 99% of the timeyou would just do that.You don't really all\nthe time want someoneto go up against you.So the blinds are really\ndriving the decision makingprocess, at least pre-flop.And the percentage\nthat those blindsare of your stack matter a lot.If they're 1% of your\nstack, if your M is 100,the blind basically\ndon't matter at all.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Whatever happens\nafter the blindsis going to materially\nimpact your decision.Where if your M is 2, and the\nblinds are half your stack,winning those seems\nreally important.You should do whatever you\ncan to kind of maximizeyour chance of winning that.So that's why M is\na good ratio here.And then, in addition,\nfor tournaments,it makes it much easier\nto talk about handswithout having to worry\nabout all the different partsof the tournament life cycle.If you have 1,500 chips\nand it's 50/100 blinds,you can basically make\nthe same decisionsas if you have 10 times as\nmany chips at a level that's10 times as high blinds.You could just\ndivide in your headand basically make\nthe same decision.You don't need to\nworry about doinganything different as a\nresult of having more chips.So Harrington\ninvented or brought upa bunch of other things\nthat never really caught on.He invented a thing called\nthe queue ratio, whichis your stack size divided\nby the average stack sizein the tournament.So I guess you might use this\nto get an idea of how far behindyou are in the tournament.Like if your queue\nis 5, you don'tneed to be that aggressive.But if your queue\nis .2, you havea lot of catching up to do\nbefore you're realisticallygoing to be anywhere\nnear the money.I don't really make\ndecisions based on that.I think the community doesn't.So it never really\ncaught on for anything.I've never actually\nheard anyone use that.So he came up with\nthis thing calledeffective M, which\nmakes sense, if youlook at M from his perspective.Effective M, it's your M\ndivided by-- you multiply by howshorthanded your table is.And it gives you the\nequivalent of the numberof 10-handed tables\nyou could survive.It just means that,\nsay you have 10 Ms,", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "you could survive\n10 rounds of blinds.If you have three\npeople at your table,you can't survive for\nanother like six hoursbecause you actually pay\nthe blind every other hand.That's what\neffective M is doing.It reduces your\nM proportionally.Since he's looking at this\nfrom the perspective of whenyou need to start making\nmoves, it kind of makes sensethat your M would be reduced\nif you're shorthanded.But I look at M from the\nperspective of how valuable itis in terms of blinds.So I don't really use that.I don't know anyone who really\nuses effective M either.But he invented them, and maybe\nthey'll catch on eventually.So I think that's going\nto be done for today.Thanks, everyone, for\na good first lecture.", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.1}]
