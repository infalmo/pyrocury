[{"text": "A few years ago,with my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier,I invented a new technology\nfor editing genomes.It's called CRISPR-Cas9.The CRISPR technology allows\nscientists to make changesto the DNA in cellsthat could allow us\nto cure genetic disease.You might be interested to knowthat the CRISPR technology came about\nthrough a basic research projectthat was aimed at discovering\nhow bacteria fight viral infections.Bacteria have to deal with viruses\nin their environment,and we can think about a viral infection\nlike a ticking time bomb --a bacterium has only a few minutes\nto defuse the bombbefore it gets destroyed.So, many bacteria have in their cells\nan adaptive immune system called CRISPR,that allows them to detect\nviral DNA and destroy it.Part of the CRISPR system\nis a protein called Cas9,that's able to seek out, cut\nand eventually degrade viral DNAin a specific way.And it was through our researchto understand the activity\nof this protein, Cas9,that we realized that we could\nharness its functionas a genetic engineering technology --a way for scientists to delete or insert\nspecific bits of DNA into cellswith incredible precision --that would offer opportunitiesto do things that really haven't\nbeen possible in the past.The CRISPR technology\nhas already been usedto change the DNA in the cells\nof mice and monkeys,other organisms as well.Chinese scientists showed recentlythat they could even use\nthe CRISPR technologyto change genes in human embryos.And scientists in Philadelphia showed\nthey could use CRISPR", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.366}, {"text": "to remove the DNA\nof an integrated HIV virusfrom infected human cells.The opportunity to do this kind\nof genome editingalso raises various ethical issues\nthat we have to consider,because this technology can be employed\nnot only in adult cells,but also in the embryos of organisms,including our own species.And so, together with my colleagues,I've called for a global conversation\nabout the technology that I co-invented,so that we can consider all of the ethical\nand societal implicationsof a technology like this.What I want to do now is tell you\nwhat the CRISPR technology is,what it can do,where we are todayand why I think we need to take\na prudent path forwardin the way that we employ this technology.When viruses infect a cell,\nthey inject their DNA.And in a bacterium,the CRISPR system allows that DNA\nto be plucked out of the virus,and inserted in little bits\ninto the chromosome --the DNA of the bacterium.And these integrated bits of viral DNA\nget inserted at a site called CRISPR.CRISPR stands for clustered regularly\ninterspaced short palindromic repeats.(Laughter)A big mouthful -- you can see why\nwe use the acronym CRISPR.It's a mechanism that allows cells\nto record, over time,the viruses they have been exposed to.And importantly, those bits of DNA\nare passed on to the cells' progeny,so cells are protected from viruses\nnot only in one generation,but over many generations of cells.This allows the cells\nto keep a record of infection,and as my colleague,\nBlake Wiedenheft, likes to say,the CRISPR locus is effectively\na genetic vaccination card in cells.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.535}, {"text": "Once those bits of DNA have been inserted\ninto the bacterial chromosome,the cell then makes a little copy\nof a molecule called RNA,which is orange in this picture,that is an exact replicate\nof the viral DNA.RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA,and it allows interaction\nwith DNA moleculesthat have a matching sequence.So those little bits of RNA\nfrom the CRISPR locusassociate -- they bind --\nto protein called Cas9,which is white in the picture,and form a complex that functions\nlike a sentinel in the cell.It searches through all\nof the DNA in the cell,to find sites that match\nthe sequences in the bound RNAs.And when those sites are found --as you can see here,\nthe blue molecule is DNA --this complex associates with that DNAand allows the Cas9 cleaver\nto cut up the viral DNA.It makes a very precise break.So we can think of the Cas9 RNA\nsentinel complexlike a pair of scissors\nthat can cut DNA --it makes a double-stranded break\nin the DNA helix.And importantly,\nthis complex is programmable,so it can be programmed to recognize\nparticular DNA sequences,and make a break in the DNA at that site.As I'm going to tell you now,we recognized that that activity\ncould be harnessed for genome engineering,to allow cells to make\na very precise change to the DNAat the site where\nthis break was introduced.That's sort of analogousto the way that we use\na word-processing programto fix a typo in a document.The reason we envisioned using\nthe CRISPR system for genome engineeringis because cells have the ability\nto detect broken DNAand repair it.So when a plant or an animal cell detects\na double-stranded break in its DNA,", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.681}, {"text": "it can fix that break,either by pasting together\nthe ends of the broken DNAwith a little, tiny change\nin the sequence of that position,or it can repair the break by integrating\na new piece of DNA at the site of the cut.So if we have a way to introduce\ndouble-stranded breaks into DNAat precise places,we can trigger cells\nto repair those breaks,by either the disruption or incorporation\nof new genetic information.So if we were able to program\nthe CRISPR technologyto make a break in DNAat the position at or near a mutation\ncausing cystic fibrosis, for example,we could trigger cells\nto repair that mutation.Genome engineering is actually not new,\nit's been in development since the 1970s.We've had technologies for sequencing DNA,for copying DNA,and even for manipulating DNA.And these technologies\nwere very promising,but the problem was\nthat they were either inefficient,or they were difficult enough to usethat most scientists had not adopted them\nfor use in their own laboratories,or certainly for many\nclinical applications.So, the opportunity to take a technology\nlike CRISPR and utilize it has appeal,because of its relative simplicity.We can think of older\ngenome engineering technologiesas similar to having\nto rewire your computereach time you want to run\na new piece of software,whereas the CRISPR technology\nis like software for the genome,we can program it easily,\nusing these little bits of RNA.So once a double-stranded\nbreak is made in DNA,we can induce repair,and thereby potentially achieve\nastounding things,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.628}, {"text": "like being able to correct mutations\nthat cause sickle cell anemiaor cause Huntington's Disease.I actually think that the first\napplications of the CRISPR technologyare going to happen in the blood,where it's relatively easier\nto deliver this tool into cells,compared to solid tissues.Right now, a lot of the work\nthat's going onapplies to animal models\nof human disease, such as mice.The technology is being used to make\nvery precise changesthat allow us to study the way\nthat these changes in the cell's DNAaffect either a tissue or,\nin this case, an entire organism.Now in this example,the CRISPR technology\nwas used to disrupt a geneby making a tiny change in the DNAin a gene that is responsible\nfor the black coat color of these mice.Imagine that these white mice\ndiffer from their pigmented litter-matesby just a tiny change at one gene\nin the entire genome,and they're otherwise completely normal.And when we sequence the DNA\nfrom these animals,we find that the change in the DNAhas occurred at exactly the place\nwhere we induced it,using the CRISPR technology.Additional experiments\nare going on in other animalsthat are useful for creating models\nfor human disease,such as monkeys.And here we find\nthat we can use these systemsto test the application of this technology\nin particular tissues,for example, figuring out how to deliver\nthe CRISPR tool into cells.We also want to understand betterhow to control the way\nthat DNA is repaired after it's cut,and also to figure out how to control\nand limit any kind of off-target,or unintended effects\nof using the technology.I think that we will see\nclinical application of this technology,", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.563}, {"text": "certainly in adults,within the next 10 years.I think that it's likely\nthat we will see clinical trialsand possibly even approved\ntherapies within that time,which is a very exciting thing\nto think about.And because of the excitement\naround this technology,there's a lot of interest\nin start-up companiesthat have been founded\nto commercialize the CRISPR technology,and lots of venture capitaliststhat have been investing\nin these companies.But we have to also considerthat the CRISPR technology can be used\nfor things like enhancement.Imagine that we could try\nto engineer humansthat have enhanced properties,\nsuch as stronger bones,or less susceptibility\nto cardiovascular diseaseor even to have propertiesthat we would consider maybe\nto be desirable,like a different eye color\nor to be taller, things like that.\"Designer humans,\" if you will.Right now, the genetic informationto understand what types of genes\nwould give rise to these traitsis mostly not known.But it's important to knowthat the CRISPR technology gives us a tool\nto make such changes,once that knowledge becomes available.This raises a number of ethical questions\nthat we have to carefully consider,and this is why I and my colleagues\nhave called for a global pausein any clinical application\nof the CRISPR technology in human embryos,to give us timeto really consider all of the various\nimplications of doing so.And actually, there is an important\nprecedent for such a pausefrom the 1970s,when scientists got togetherto call for a moratorium\non the use of molecular cloning,until the safety of that technology\ncould be tested carefully and validated.So, genome-engineered humans\nare not with us yet,", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.557}, {"text": "but this is no longer science

intended impacts\nof a scientific breakthrough.Thank you.(Applause)(Applause ends)Bruno Giussani: Jennifer, this is\na technology with huge consequences,as you pointed out.Your attitude about asking for a pause\nor a moratorium or a quarantineis incredibly responsible.There are, of course,\nthe therapeutic results of this,but then there are the un-therapeutic onesand they seem to be the ones\ngaining traction,particularly in the media.This is one of the latest issues\nof The Economist -- \"Editing humanity.\"It's all about genetic enhancement,\nit's not about therapeutics.What kind of reactions\ndid you get back in Marchfrom your colleagues in the science world,when you asked or suggestedthat we should actually pause this\nfor a moment and think about it?Jennifer Doudna: My colleagues\nwere actually, I think, delightedto have the opportunity\nto discuss this openly.It's interesting that as I talk to people,my scientific colleagues\nas well as others,there's a wide variety\nof viewpoints about this.So clearly it's a topic that needs\ncareful consideration and discussion.BG: There's a big meeting\nhappening in Decemberthat you and your colleagues are calling,together with the National Academy\nof Sciences and others,what do you hope will come\nout of the meeting, practically?JD: Well, I hope that we can air the viewsof many different individuals\nand stakeholderswho want to think about how to use\nthis technology responsibly.It may not be possible to come up with\na consensus point of view,but I think we should at least understandwhat all the issues are as we go forward.BG: Now, colleagues of yours,like George Church,\nfor example, at Harvard,", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.611}, {"text": "they say, \"Yeah, ethical issues basically\nare just a question of safety.We test and test and test again,\nin animals and in labs,and then once we feel it's safe enough,\nwe move on to humans.\"So that's kind of the other\nschool of thought,that we should actually use\nthis opportunity and really go for it.Is there a possible split happening\nin the science community about this?I mean, are we going to see\nsome people holding backbecause they have ethical concerns,and some others just going forwardbecause some countries under-regulate\nor don't regulate at all?JD: Well, I think with any new technology,\nespecially something like this,there are going to be\na variety of viewpoints,and I think that's\nperfectly understandable.I think that in the end,this technology will be used\nfor human genome engineering,but I think to do that without careful\nconsideration and discussionof the risks and potential complicationswould not be responsible.BG: There are a lot of technologies\nand other fields of sciencethat are developing exponentially,\npretty much like yours.I'm thinking about artificial\nintelligence, autonomous robots and so on.No one seems --aside from autonomous warfare robots --nobody seems to have launched\na similar discussion in those fields,in calling for a moratorium.Do you think that your discussion may\nserve as a blueprint for other fields?JD: Well, I think it's hard for scientists\nto get out of the laboratory.Speaking for myself,it's a little bit\nuncomfortable to do that.But I do think that being involved\nin the genesis of thisreally puts me and my colleagues\nin a position of responsibility.And I would say that I certainly hope\nthat other technologieswill be considered in the same way,just as we would want to consider\nsomething that could have implicationsin other fields besides biology.BG: Jennifer, thanks for coming to TED.JD: Thank you.(Applause)", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.534}]
