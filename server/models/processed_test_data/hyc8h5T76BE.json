we'd take a\nlook at the annual financialsof this business.At the end of 2007, the net\nrevenues for Lehman Brotherswas $19 billion.This is a firm that earned $19\nbillion in revenues in 2007.We're not talking about\na small little shop here.This is a major\nfinancial institution.And if you look at their\nprofits, their net income,$4 billion of net\nincome in 2007.And 2007 was not a great\nyear, so $4 billion of incomeis a pretty impressive number.And if you look at their\nlong-term capital, the capitalbase, we're looking\nat $145 billion.And if you take a look at\ntheir assets under management,the assets under management,\nin billions, is $282 billionof assets under management.Now, at the end of\n2007, would anybodyhave forecasted that\na company like thiscould be gone nine

key to what's\ngoing on and whythis might have happened\nis this number right here,the net leverage ratio.That net leverage\nratio tells yousomething about how much\nexposure Lehman Brothers

number,although in recent years,\nit's much less than that.For example, when I first\nbought my home way back in 1988,my first home, when I\nmoved here to Boston,I actually only\nhad to put 5% downbecause I was able to get a\njumbo loan and, in addition,purchase mortgage insurance\nso that the bank waswilling to lend me quite a bit\nmore than they usually would.Now, let's take the 20%\ndown

around a lot.For example, let's do a\nsimple back-of-the-envelopecalculation.Suppose house\nprices fall by 10%.That's only 10%, right?That's not a huge number.It's significant,\nbut it's not

those kinds of\ninvestments were low enoughthat the leverage\ndidn't scare me at all.And in fact, I\ndidn't lose money.I held that house for\nabout five or six yearsand bought another\none, and it was

rates\nbecause they wantto reduce the pressure\non the system for exactlythese kinds of issues.They want to reduce the\nkind of default rates.And by keeping\ninterest rates low,they actually are going\nto be able to encourageliquidity and reduce\nthe kind of pressurethat we've been seeing.Yeah, question.AUDIENCE: I was\ngoing to ask whathappens if you put your 5%\ndown, and the value of the housegoes down, say, 25%,\nit's been only a year.You feel like you're not\ngoing to get-- it's nevergoing to come back up.Can you literally just go to\nthe bank and say it's yours?ANDREW LO: Well, that depends\non what you signed when you gotyour mortgage from the bank.Most mortgage contracts are\nknown as non-recourse loans,meaning that they've got\nyour house as collateral,but that's all they've got.They don't have\nyour firstborn, theydon't have your pinky finger.And depending on where\nyou borrow, in some cases,you may have to give that up.But no, the fact of the\nmatter is the most

point when\nthe market recovers,we're going to see\nthat come back again.And so you will be\nable to borrow again.Yeah.AUDIENCE: Given that the\ninterest rates are now goingup, does that mean\nthe [INAUDIBLE]----ANDREW LO: Going down.AUDIENCE: Despite the fact that\nthe financial cut [INAUDIBLE],,the actual interest rate\nthat homeowners are payinghasn't changed.ANDREW LO: Right.AUDIENCE: So does that mean\nthat those with good creditare effectively subsidizing\nthose with bad credit?ANDREW LO: Well, yes and no.I mean, I think that\nthe subsidizationthat you're talking about really\nhappens very, very indirectly.The fact that there are\nlarge numbers of defaultsultimately may mean that it's\nharder to get a subprime loan.So the folks that\nare actually goodcredits, but don't meet the\nprime borrowing rate criteria,yes, they will suffer.But at equilibrium-- by\nequilibrium I mean when supplyequals demand--the price is the\nprice is the price.So it depends on what

sense, it'snot as if taxpayers\nare footing the billfor the particular interest\nrate shifts that are going on.Taxpayers may end up\nfooting the bill for whathappened with Bear Stearns,\nwhat happened with FannieMae and Freddie Mac.And that's one of the reasons\nwhy, over the weekend,when the Fed was approached\nby Lehman Brothers and said,hey, you've got to\nhelp us out here,the Fed said, you know

as ?] they do,what's the negative part?Inflation?ANDREW LO: Yes.We're actually going\nto talk about thatin this next segment--inflation.If the Fed cuts\nrates, one could arguethat the reason we're\nin the mess that we areis because the Fed\nhad kept the Fed fundsrate so low for so long\nthat even after the stockmarket crashed with the\ninternet bubble bursting,the housing market\ncontinued on with its bubblebecause it was still\nso cheap to borrow.And I'm sure I've\nmentioned beforethat when I was an assistant\nprofessor at the Wharton Schoolback in 1986 looking\nto buy a house,the 30-year fixed was at 18%.18% for a 30-year\nfixed mortgage.I didn't do it because I\ncouldn't afford it at the time,but think about\nthat versus today.Mortgage rates are maybe at\na recent high of 6%, 7%, 8%.That's not bad, relative\nto historical standards.OK, so yes, I mean, I\nthink that's the concernthat if we keep\ninterest rates too low,that's going to\nencourage inflation.And inflation will\nhave its own costs.Anybody who's from any\nLatin American countrywill know the ghost of inflation\nis tremendously frightening.And we don't want to let\nthat get out of hand.If you remember\nback to the 1970s,we had some inflation in the\nUS that was a real problem.So we're going to talk about\nthat in just a couple minutes.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Any

exactly\nmean that Lehman Brothers arebankrupt?Because everybody, I guess\nit's not a written one,but if I have some\nmoney deposited there,will they give it back to\nme because I am a

has\nbigger exposure than Lehman.The difference is\nthat Merrill Lynchhas other sources\nof revenue thatare able to let it get\nthrough this situation a bitmore gracefully.But the problem is we\ndon't

let me let me give\nyou the short answer now.The short answer is that within\nthe next two or three months,Wall Street will be frozen.They're going to be a deer\ncaught in the headlights.They won't know what's going on.They won't know what\ntheir hiring plans are.They won't know the\nnumber of slots.There's resumes\nflying back and forth.So it's going to be a bit of\nchaos for the next two or

two or three months,I actually think this\nis a fantastic timeto get into the industry.Because when you have\nthese kind of dislocations,opportunities get created.And opportunities for\npeople that are smart,that are hungry, that are\nwilling to work hard--I mean, that's exactly\nthe kind of situationthat you want to be in.When things are going\nwell, they don't need you.They're going to

taking\nthem so much of your time,but I think this is relevant and\nwill be useful for what we'regoing to be talking about next.Let me turn to what we ended\nwith in the last class, whichis the inflation topic.Last class, you'll recall, we\ntalked about the two formulasthat you're going\nto know very wellby the end of this\ncourse, perpetuitiesand annuities and compounding.And where we ended

exactlywhat the idea is.It's really meant to capture\nthe fact that the purchasingpower of your money can\nvary over time, irrespectiveof the time value of money.And let me explain it this way--at a particular point in\ntime, let's say time t,you've got a certain\namount of wealth, wt.And the value of the kinds of\nthings that you like to buyis given by an index.Call it I sub t.So you could think about that\nas the price of the basketof goods that you enjoy.OK?So this will include consumer\nitems, food, clothing.As well, it may include other\nitems-- leisure, entertainment,and so on.And the fact that you have\na certain amount of wealthdoesn't really tell\nyou how happy you are.It's really how much\nyou're able to consume.How you use that wealth that\ntells you how happy you are.",

goingto have a different\namount of wealth.Hopefully bigger.And presumably, you're going\nto be able to consume more.Well, that's presuming\nthat the prices of what youlike to consume don't change.But if those prices do\nchange, then in fact,you might not be really\nbetter off in any way.And so in order for you\nto tell whether or notyou're better off\nor worse off, youneed to know not only\nhow much wealth you have,but how much that wealth can\nbuy you in terms of the stuffthat you like to consume.So the idea behind inflation\nis to measure the purchasingpower of your dollar.And that's completely different\nfrom time value of money.Time value of money simply\nsays that people are impatientand they prefer money\nnow to money later.But inflation is a comment\nabout the purchasingpower of that dollar\nnow versus later.And it can go either way.In other words, it's possible\nthat a dollar next yearwill buy you more\nthan a dollar todaybecause if prices decline, as\nthey have right now for energy,for example.Energy is below $100 a barrel.Just a few months ago,\nit was at $130 a barrel.So if we had a winter\na few months ago,that would have been really bad\nbecause home heating oil

when you're looking\nat your portfolio,you might ask the\nquestion what'smy return on my portfolio.And the way you\ncalculate that returnis look at your wealth at time\nt plus k divided by your wealthat time t, subtract 1 from it.And that's your return, right?That's often called\nthe nominal returnbecause it's in\nname only, meaningit's the actual\nnumber of dollar billsthat your wealth will grow to.So if you've got\n$1,000 this year,next year you've got\n$1,100, your nominal returnfor your wealth is 10%.That's the number\nof dollar billsyou'll have more than\nyou had this year.10%

focusing on nominal\nreturns or real returns, OK?And ultimately, as a consumer,\nwhat you all care aboutis real returns.You want to know whether you're\ngetting better off in termsof what you can really consume.So how do you do that.Well, first of all, you\nhave to change the units.Sorry, question?AUDIENCE: Why pi?ANDREW LO: Why that letter?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]ANDREW LO: Oh, no, no, no.I'm

no approximation.In fact, your inflation rate,\nyour real rate of return,is zero, right?10% minus 10% is zero.Where the approximation\nhappens iswhen you have something\na little bit different.For example, suppose the\ninflation rate were 10%and suppose your nominal\nrate of return was 15%.According to this\napproximation, what'syour real rate of return?5%, right.It's not exactly 5% because

you do.And that is simply to keep\ntrack of whether you're usingnominal or real cash flows.And then to use nominal or\nreal discount rates to match.In other words,\nnominal cash flowshould be divided by\nnominal discount rates.And real cash flow should be\ndenominated by real discountrates.Most of the cash flows that you\nwill get in your analysis willtypically be nominal.Nominal meaning that's

lecture.And for special cash flows like\nannuities and perpetuities,we've got closed form solutions.Formulas, which you can program\nup in Excel to figure out.The kind of risks\nthat we're goingto focus on later on in this\nlecture and in the lecturesafter we talk about\nuncertainty is inflation risk.We talked about that, right?The fact that when you buy\na bond or you sell a bond,if the purchasing\npower changes, that'sgoing to introduce a\nnew kind of unknownthat we need to grapple with.Credit risk.That's a major form\nof risk that we'redealing with in\nfinancial markets todayand that we're likely to be\ndealing with for years to come.You might like to borrow\nfrom me or lend to me,but what about credit issues.How do you know\nthat I'm still goingto be around a year from\nnow, two years from now.Timing, which we'll come back\nto a little bit later on.Liquidity.And then of course,\nwhat currency.If we're doing\ninternational borrowing,we have an extra dimension of\nrisk, which is fluctuationsin the exchange rate, OK?So for the next\ncouple of lectures,I want to keep life simple and\ntalk just about riskless debt.Riskless in terms of\ndefault. So in particular I'mgoing to be talking about\nUS government bonds.All right?And I'll come back\nto risky debt later.But for now, let's just focus\non the debt that will notdefault because you can always\nprint up dollars to pay offyour creditors, right?Those dollars may\nnot be worth as muchas you would like them to be\nif you do too much of that,", "start": 3840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "but for now, we're not\ngoing to focus on default.OK so the first kind\nof bond that we'regoing to try to price is what's\ncalled a pure discount bond.This is a bond that is different\nfrom a coupon bond in the sensethat there are no coupons.So it only pays off\none payment at the end.And the reason it's\ncalled the discount bondis because it is\nwhat it sounds like--the price of the bond today\nis going to be at a discountfrom the face value.If the face value is $1,000\nand there's nothing in between,then the price of the banters\ncan't be greater than $1,000because money today is worth\nmore than money next year.So the price today is going\nto be lower than $1,000.It's going to be a\ndiscount over $1,000, hencethe term pure discount bond.Now there are pure\ndiscount bonds out there.US treasury bills\nare examples, wherethere's one payoff at the\nend and nothing in between.But awhile ago,\nfinancial engineerscame up with a rather\nbrilliant idea,which you may not think is\nso brilliant because it'sso painfully obvious.The government issues\ncoupon bonds as well.And typically, for\nlonger maturities,like five years,\n15 and 30 years,there are no pure discount bonds\nfor those longer maturities.When the government issues them,\nthey issue them with coupons.But you can imagine\na situation wheresomebody would like to have\na discount bond for 30 years.And so some clever\nfinancial engineer said,hey, here's what\nI'm going to do.I'm going to buy up a lot of\nthese treasury coupon bondsand I'm going to issue\ndiscount bonds thatmatch exactly the coupon\npayments from my treasurybonds.In other words, I'm\ngoing to take the couponsand strip them and offer them\nup as separate securities.", "start": 3960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And I'm going to\ncall these STRIPS.And these STRIPS, which\nstands for separate tradingof registered interest\nand principal securities,created a huge market\nfor essentiallywhat are government\nbonds, but thathave been
