purificationtechniques efficiently\nand effectivelyis key to becoming a\nsuccessful experimentalist.Recrystallization is\none powerful methodfor the purification\nof crystalline solids.This video will outline the\npurification of naphthaleneby recrystallization.The technique of\nrecrystallizationinvolves five main steps.First, an appropriate\nsolvent is determined.Recrystallizations\ncan be carried outusing either one or a\nmixture of two solvents,depending on the\nsolubility of the sample.Next, the sample is\ndissolved in a minimal amountof the proper solvent.At this point, the\nsolution can be decolorizedand insoluble contaminants\ncan be removedby performing a hot filtration.The resulting solution\nis then cooledto induce crystallization.And finally, the\npurified crystalsare collected by filtration,\nwashed, and dried.This video will first\noutline the general procedurefor carrying out a one\nsolvent recrystallizationof naphthalene followed\nby instructionsfor adapting the procedure to a\ntwo solvent recrystallization.Choosing an appropriate\nsolvent for a recrystallizationis a very important step.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.14}, {"text": "You won't get acceptable results\nif you

recrystallization.[ALARM BLARING]MAN: Caution.Organic solvents are flammable.Never heat over an open flame.PROFESSOR: To set\nup a water bath,place a large crystallizing\ndish about half fullwith water on a hot plate.Add some boiling stones\nand turn on the heat.Don't turn it up all the way.Start halfway and\nadjust from there.To perform a\nsolubility test, placeapproximately 20 milligrams of\nyour compound in a test tube.Add a half of a milliliter\nof the appropriate solventand swirl.Wait a couple of\nminutes and then makenote of whether or not\nthe compound dissolves.For example, at\nroom temperature,naphthalene is insoluble\nin ethanol and waterbut soluble in\ntoluene and acetone.If there is still solid\nremaining, clamp the tubeand heat it in the water\nbath until the solvent boils.Swirl the tube and\nmake note of whetheror not the compound dissolves.After heating, naphthalene\nis still insoluble in water,but it is now soluble\nin hot ethanol.Now that you have
