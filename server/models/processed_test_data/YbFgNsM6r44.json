Walter Lewin,to help you understand\nthe physics of wavesand vibrations.Now you may well ask, why\nspend so much effort on wavesand vibrations.And the answer is very simple.If you take any system,\ndisturb it from equilibrium,from a stable equilibrium,\nthe resultant motionis waves and vibrations.So it's a very\ncommon phenomenon.Not only is it that very\ncommon, understanding wavesand vibrations\nhave very importantpractical applications.And furthermore, the\nfact that they exist,that this phenomenon exists,\nhas tremendous consequenceson our world.If waves and vibrations were\ndifferent or didn't exist,you wouldn't recognize\nour universe.What is the role I am\nplaying in this course?To answer that question,\nI have to remind youwhat is the scientific method.In essence, the scientific\nmethod has two components.The first, you\nlook around and youdescribe what you see in the\none and only language thatcan be used, or we\nfind that can beused for the\ndescription of nature.That this mathematics, in terms\nof mathematical equations.The second aspect is\nsince the universe", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.222}, {"text": "is describable in terms\nof mathematical equations,we can solve those equations.And that means predict\nresult of situations,of experiments, which\nwe've never seen before.Again, this is important\nfor two reasons.One, practical-- to be able\nto predict what will happen.But the other far\nmore important isthat it is the way we have,\nthe objective way we haveof checking whether our\nunderstanding of the universeis correct or not.If the predictions do not give\nthe right-- do not correspondto what one actually sees,\nyou know, your theory,your understanding is wrong.My role is related\nto the second part.In other words, what I would\nwant to help you learn,take a given situation,\nconvert it into mathematics,solve it, and predict\nwhat will happen.We call that problem solving.OK.Let me immediately start\nwith a concrete example.What I have here,\ndescribing a situation whichwe would like to understand.Imagine you have\nan ideal spring,a spring that obeys Hooke's law.As I've shown here is the\nspring constant k, length,natural length l0, and your\nsuspend it from the ceiling.Imagine that you take\na mass, a small mass,m, and you attach\nit to that spring.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "At some instant of time, and in\nthe proceeds of attaching it,you may stretch the string.So the spring may at this\ninstant not be stretched.But let's assume\nwhile you're attachingand you've stretched\nthe spring a little bit,you're holding it, all right.At that instant, it's\nvelocity is 0, stationary.You let go.The question is,\nwhat will happen?Can you predict what will be\nthe motion of that particle?You know, you've\nseen this often.But a priori, it's not\nobvious what will happen.The spring may pull the mass up.The mass may pull\nthe spring more down.It may oscillate.Everything, until you've\nunderstood what's going on, youcannot predict the outcome.So let's assume that at\nsome instant of time,we call that time t, it's\nas shown on the right.In order to be able\nto describe this,I have to tell you\nwhere these masses areat these various times.So I will define a\ncoordinate system.This is a one\ndimensional situation.So I only need one coordinate.And I'll call it the y.My y will be up.All right.Now I also have to measure\nthings from some location.So I need to define what\nI mean by y equals 0.And I will define y\nequals 0, the positionwhere if the mass is at that\nlocation, the force of gravitypulling it down and the\nspring force pulling it upcancel, so that there is no\nnet force on the particle.So y equals 0 is the\nequilibrium position.And then the position\nof the springwhen it has no mass attached\nis the distance y0 from that", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "at t equals 0, the position\nI will say is y initial.That's some number.So that's a known quantity.All right.And that any other instant time,\nI defined it as y equals t.That is the physical situation\nI wish to understand.I want to know what\nhappened with that spring.So now I will translate\nthat into mathematics.I will now try to give you\na mathematical descriptionof that situation.So we know that we are dealing\nwith forces and masses.So to describe that, we\nuse Newtonian mechanics.So here is now my\nmathematical description.The mass is a point m, of mass\nm, on which two forces act.There is the force fs due to\nthe spring and the force fgdue to the fact that this mass\nis in the gravitational field,and therefore there is\na gravitational forceon this mass, fg.OK.We call this a force diagram.Or some people call it\nthe free body diagram.Now this mass, because\nof the force acting it,its motion will change.And it will have\nan acceleration,which I will call a of t.And by the way, that of course\nis the second derivativeof y with respect to dt.It's a vector.It's in the y direction.And in order so I don't\nhave to write things overand too many things\nin these equations,I will define the symbol\ny with two dots on itas the second derivative\nof y with respect to time.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "y dot is the first\nderivative-- in other words,the velocity, et cetera.And by the way, you may notice\nI'm going very slowly here.I'm doing that intentionally.I'm going to go here in gory\ndetail every part, you know,because often I know\nthat when one goesto a lecture, or studies\nin a book, et cetera,you look at some step\nfrom one step to another.And you can't figure it out.The reason for it often is not\nthat you are not smart enoughto do it, is but the\nbecause the teacheror whoever wrote\nthe book, et cetera,is so familiar with\nthe material he willdo several steps in\nhis head or her head,and you don't know about it.For this first\nexample, I will tryto avoid anything of that kind.Later on, I'll go faster.And I'll do the same\nas everybody else.But the moment, as I say,\nI'm going in gory detail.OK.So this is the diagram,\nthis free body diagram,of the situation.And I know from\nNewtonian mechanicsthat if there are forces\nacting on that mass,that mass will have\nan acceleration, whichwill be equal to the\nnet force acting on it,divided by the mass, the\ninertia, of that system.So that is what a will be.I further know the\nforce is vector,so the net force\nacting on this massis the sum of those,\nthe vectorial sum,of those two forces.So f is the sum of the\nforce due to the springand due to gravity.Next, we also know\nsomething about the spring.I told you at the\nbeginning that I'mconsidering an ideal spring.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "So for the purpose\nof this problem,I'm assuming I have this\nfictitious thing, a springwhich essentially has\nno mass, massless,which obeys exactly Hooke's law.And here I can't help\ndigress and point out to youthat that's a terrible misnomer.There is no Hooke's\nlaw of nature.It is an empirical relation\nwhich tells you the forcethat the spring exerts when you\nstretch it a certain distance,all right.But anyway, it's\nstuck historically.It's Hooke's law.So Hooke's law,\nfrom Hooke's law,I know what will be the force,\nfs, when the situation is asshown over there,\nall right, at time t.So at this time, this\nextension of this springwill be, of course, y0 minus yt.OK.And so I get that the\nforce due to the springwill be the spring constant\ntimes its extensionat that instant of time.It is a vector.And y0 is a bigger number than\nyt, this is a positive number.Therefore, the stretched\nspring will pull the mass up.So this is in the y direction.This is plus.How about the\ngravitational force?Well, that is, of\ncourse, the minus mg,the force of the\ngravitational field on that.And it's minus in\nthe y directionhere, because it's\npulling this mass down.OK.Now what else do we know?We know that we could get\neverything done very carefully.We know that we\ndefined y equals 0to be the equilibrium position.Therefore, when y is 0, we know\nthat the second derivative of y", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "is 0.It's not accelerating.So that's a condition\nwe must not forget.Another thing we know that\ninitially, in other words,at t equals 0, the position\nof that mass is y

continue now\nusing this informationand try to reduce it to the\nminimum set of equations.From a equals fm, from this,\nI get that the accelerationis the total force divided by m.I can now replace\nthese two forcesfrom the information\nI wrote over there.And so that is equal, 1\nover-- this is f over m.It's 1 of m times\nthe net force, whichis the force due to the\nspring minus the forcedue to the gravity, OK.So from this, I can now actually\nwrite an algebraic equation,rather than the vector one.Notice - ha ha.I have noticed myself\neven something.Here this has to be\nin the direction of y.OK.This is a vector equation,\nbut all the partsare in the same direction,\nin the y direction.Therefore, I can rewrite this\njust the equation for the one", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "component and not bother to\nwrite the y hats throughout.So this equation I've rewritten\nnow just removing y hat.So this is how the mass\nwill be accelerating.Unfortunately, it's\na single equation,but I have more than\none unknown in it.Because I don't know y0.And I don't know y of t.Clearly, I won't be able to\nsolve that equation, all right.But at that stage, I go\nback to the informationI told you at the beginning.We defined y equals 0\nto be the place wherea y double dot, the\nsecond derivative, is 0.Therefore, I can write\nthat at position.When y of t is 0, this is 0.So 0 is equal to 1 over\nm, into ky minus mg.And I immediately from\nthis get that ky0 is mg.Therefore, I have\nfound what y0 is.OK.Great.So there's only\none unknown here.So using this\ninformation in here,I end up immediately\nwith this equation,that the second derivative\nof y with respectto time, the\nacceleration of the massis equal to minus k\nover m times y of t.At this stage, I will really\nfind this quantity, k over m.For the time being, you can look\nat it as just for convenience,less to write on the board.But later, you see this\nwill help us understandhow to deal with\ndifferent situations.But for the time\nbeing, you can justthink of this as a\nconvenience, so I", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "can write less on the board.And I end up finally\nwith one equation.The second derivative of\ny with respect to timeis equal to minus a constant,\nthat's k over m, right,times the value of y times t.This is the equation of\nmotion for this mass.It tells me in mathematical\nform how the motion of that masschanges with time.I can now actually\npredict what willhappen in this\nparticular situation.Because I know what was\nthe motion of it at time 0.I know that at time 0, the\nposition was y initial.And the velocity was 0.These three lines are completely\nequivalent from the pointof view of understanding\nthe motion of the massto our original description.This is a physical\ndescription of the situation.This is a mathematical\ndescriptionof the same situation.So we've achieved step one.We've translated a\nphysical situationinto a mathematical one.Let me now try\nfrom this, I shouldbe able to predict\nwhat this mass will do.OK.I'm now switching into\nthe world the mathematics.As I just am\nrepeating here, I'vegone away from

math.That's the role of the\nmath department, all right.So how do I solve that equation?And let me tell\nyou how I solve it.I am make use of the\nso-called uniqueness theorem.I know, or the\nmathematicians have told me,that if I find a solution to\nthat equation which satisfies--if I find a solution which\nsatisfies that equation,and if it has the right\nnumber of arbitrary constant,then I have found the one\nand only general equation,which is a solution of that.Let me be concrete.y of t equals to a cosine omega\nt plus phi, where A and phi arearbitrary, are arbitrary.They are some arbitrary numbers.But a number is there.This can be 7 and this\ncan be 21 degrees,or whatever, but any number.This equation satisfies\nmy differential equation.", "start":

that equation.It has the right number\nof arbitrary constants,that two arbitrary\nconstants in here.And therefore, this\nis the only solutionin the universe\nof that equation.OK.Now, so being a\nphysicist, I don'tcare how I got the solution.Once I had the\nsolution, if I knowit's the only one\nthat exists, I'm home.Now you can say well, I\nsuppose I didn't guess it.Well, there are many ways.You go on the web and find it.You go in the book and find it.You ask your friends\nwhat it is, all right.That's mathematics.And once you've found the\nsolution, we can go on.All right, so this is the\nsolution of that equation.Next, if that's\ny, what is y dot?What is the rate of change of t?That's going to equal minus\nomega 0 A sine omega 0 tplus phi, OK.Can I predict what will happen?All

minus omega 0 A sine phi.OK.Therefore, I immediately\nconclude that phi is 0.OK.Next, I know-- so now\nthat I know that phi is 0,I can go back to this equation.This is now 0.And we know that y at

will\nbe the motion of this.What's going to\nhappen to this ruler.Is it going to start spinning\naround this, like this forever?What will happen?So I will try to translate\nthis problem into

forcesthrough a single\npoint mass and forces.Now we are doing a Newtonian\ndynamics for rigid body motion.You know that if a rigid body\nis in the gravitational field,the gravity acts force fg.We can

a\ntorque about p becauseof the gravitational force.And as a result, there's going\nto be the acceleration, whichas we've said over there,\nis theta double dot of t.Now, we know that torques gives\nrise to angular acceleration.Let me define that we will take\nclockwise motion, clockwisemotion, clockwise\nrotations to be positive.So any rotation, this angle,\nfor example, I am sorry.I
