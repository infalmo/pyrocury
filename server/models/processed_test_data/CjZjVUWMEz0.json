materials,and I think it's just\nabout the right time.That you guys know\nenough about radiationinteracting with\nmatter and everything,and stopping power,\nand processing,to actually make sense of\nnuclear materials and radiationdamage.And this is my whole\ntheme, so happyto come talk to\nyou guys about thisand show you why I\nthink it's interesting.Because it all goes--this slide kind of gets onto it.It starts off with the\nsingle-atom atomic defectsthat make up the basic\nbuilding blocks of damageand ends up with things that\nbreak in nuclear reactorsunder radiation.And so to understand\nthe whole thing,you've got to know everything\nfrom the single atomson the sort of\nfemtosecond scale,all the way up to\nthe engineering scalewhere things evolve over\nyears or even decades.So we'll be talking--first, probably\ntoday, we're goingto go over a material\nscience primer.So who here has had any\ncourses in material science?No one.That's good because I'm\nassuming that there is a--see, no one knows anything here.I know there's a couple material\nscientists in the class,and I'll apologize ahead of\ntime if it's a bit of a review.But we'll be going mostly\nthrough what are materialsand what are the defects\nthat change their materialproperties, and\nhow do they behave.That'll take us\nthrough about today.So then tomorrow, we can see how\nradiation causes those defectsand actually changes\nmaterial properties.So there's a whole laundry\nlist of different waysthat materials\nfail, and most folksare concerned with\nall of these--everything from simple\noverload, which means youstress something too\nmuch and it just breaks,to all the different\nforms of corrosion.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.68}, {"text": "That's a whole field in itself.And then there's\nthe things that justwe have to worry about\nbecause they're only activatedwith radiation damage.And in this case, this isn't\nquite ionization by radiation,but it's actual radiation\nslamming into nucleiand moving atoms\nout of their place.And we've got one figure\nthat we had recentlyin a paper that sums up the\nentire multi-scale pictureof radiation damage, from the\nfemtosecond to, let's say,the megasecond scale.Or I think it's more than that.Maybe gigasecond would be\nthe right word for that.And all the way down from the\nangstrom to the meter scale.And I want to walk you\nthrough sort of a lens scaleby lens scale depiction\nof radiation damage.It all starts with knocking\natoms out of place.We've mentioned\nthis a little bitwhen we talked about\nnuclear stopping power,and this is where it\nactually comes into play.Sometimes an incoming\nneutron or photon or ioncan displace an atom\nfrom its original site,and we call that a physical--\nit's a displacement.And then that atom comes\noff with quite a bitof kinetic energy and can\nknock into a whole bunchof other atoms.Now this loss of the solid\ncrystalline structure,you can't really tell what the\noriginal structure looked like,right?It actually comprises a\nvery small, localized zoneof melting called\na thermal spike.If you think about,\nall these atomsare vibrating at\nfractions of an eV--at thermal energies,\nlike the thermal neutronswe talked about in the reactor.Then you hit them\nwith an MeV neutron.They might transfer\n100 keV of energy.And a bunch of these\natoms will thenbe moving about at, let's\nsay, a few hundred eV.That's way beyond\nliquid temperature.So actually, it's been\ntheorized that there'sa little pocket of atoms around\nthree to five nanometers widethat reaches, like, 10,000\nKelvin for a very, veryshort amount of time--less than a picosecond.Because almost\ninstantly, those atomsknock into the ones\naround them, and this", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.507}, {"text": "is how the process of\nheat transfer occurs.And so, very quickly,\nyou get what'scalled the quench, where\nmost of those atomsvery quickly knock\ninto other ones,slowing down, finding their\nequilibrium positions again,but not every one.You can see there's a few\nplaces where the atoms are stillout of their original location.And it's those residual\ndefects that actuallycomprise radiation damage.And as those defects build\nup, they start to move.They can diffuse.They can be transported\nballisticallyby more radiation damage.They can move by all sorts\nof different mechanismsand eventually find each other,\nforming what's called clusters.So a bunch of those missing\natoms could find each otherand make a hole,\nwhich we call a void.A bunch of the extra\natoms shoved inbetween the other\nones can form thingscalled interstitial clusters.We say interstitial because\nit's like in the spacein between where you'd\nnormally find some atoms.So let's say you had a whole\nbunch of those missing atomscome together, forming a void.This is an actual Transmission\nElectron Microscope,or TEM, image of a void--pockets of vacuum in materials.Notice anything interesting\nabout its shape?AUDIENCE: It's, like, rounded.PROFESSOR: It's rounded, but\nwhat's most striking to meis it isn't actually round.So you would expect a void or a\nbubble to be kind of spherical,right?That's the minimum energy\nconfiguration of most things.Not so when you have a\nlittle pocket of vacuum.It's where crystallinity\ncomes into play.And these voids can end up\nforming superstructures.What curious thing\ndo you notice here?For this whole\nensemble of voids.Yeah?AUDIENCE: It seems like\nthey're all in line.PROFESSOR: They are all\nin the same direction.Kind of funny.That's definitely not\nan accident, right?That's not like they're\nrandomly aligned.There's a reason\nfor this, that we'llgo into in a couple slides.Yeah?AUDIENCE: What's\nthe size scale here?PROFESSOR: The size scale?", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.331}, {"text": "I think these are on the\norder of 20 nanometers or so.Yeah, I cropped these images\njust to get points across.Let's see if it says\nin the older one.Not quite.Yeah, but these voids can get\nupwards of tens of nanometers.As small as single atoms.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Sorry, what is this?PROFESSOR: This is\nthe accumulationof radiation defects\ninto what's called voids.Yeah.Don't worry, we'll go over\nit in more detail again.And if you get little pockets\nof vacuum in your material,you're not creating\nor destroying mass.You're just moving it.So those voids, where that mass\nwas has to go somewhere else,and you actually get\nthings that swellin the reactor on their own.They don't change mass\nbut they change volume.They just kind of puff up\nlike Swiss cheese, sometimesupwards of 20% or 30% changes\nin diameter and lengthfor some tubing.Now if you're depending\non these fuel rodsbeing a certain space\napart in a reactorand they start to swell,\nsqueezing out the coolant,you lose the ability\nto cool the reactor.Because then how can you\nget water around somethingwhere the tubes have\nthen swelled together?There's lots of other bad\nthings that can happen,which we'll get into.And so then that's the\norigin of void swelling.From single missing\natoms called vacancies,they can cluster\ninto voids whichthen cause physical dimensional\nchanges of materialson the scale of\ncentimeters to meters.And that's why we say it's\nthis full multi-scale pictureof radiation damage.But to understand,\nwhat is damage,you have to know what is\nan undamaged structureto begin with.So it doesn't make sense to say,\nhow does a structure change,if you don't know\nhow it behaves.So I want to give a very quick\nprimer to material science.And apologies to any material\nscientists in the roombecause this is going\nto seem really basic,but this is a very quick\nintro to this whole field.I want to go over quickly,\nwhat is a crystalline solid?A perfectly undamaged\nmaterial wouldbe a set of atoms lined up\nin a very regular latticeand of regular array, where you\nmove over a certain distance", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.344}, {"text": "and you find another atom.And this extends forever\nand ever and ever,all the way out to when\nyou reach the free surface.And so this is what we would\ncall an undamaged material.A pristine, perfect,\nsingle crystal.By crystal, I mean\nan arrangementof atoms in a certain direction.So notice here, all of the atoms\nare lined up in, let's say,some cubic xyz way.That's what we would call\none crystal or one grain.You'll hear both of those.And you'll notice also that\nthe arrangement of the atomstends to determine what the\nphysical objects look like.Or we like to say\nthat form followsstructure in material science.So for materials\nlike pyrite, whichfollows a simple cubic\nstructure, that's the crystalsyou pull out of the ground.They mimic their\natomic configurationsin physical\ncentimeter-sized space.For gold atoms, they adopt a\nslightly different structure.It's still cubic\nbut there is atomsshoved into the cube faces.It's what we call\nFace-Centered Cubic, or FCC.And you start to see\ncube-looking structuresall over single\ncrystals of gold.Another one, gypsum.It's got a very different type\nof structure called monoclinic,where none of the sides of\nthis parallelogram are the sameand there are some funny angles.But if you look at the\narrangement of the atomsand the actual crystals\nof gypsum that grow,you see a striking similarity,\nwhich I find pretty neat.I also want to mention, what\nis the absence of structurein material science?We call that something\nthat's amorphous.Amorphous means without form.So for example, crystalline\nindium phosphidewould have this regular\nstructure like this.You move over a\ncertain distance,you see another green atom,\nand so on and so on and so on.In an amorphous material,\nit can still be a solid,but there is no fixed distance\nbetween any certain typesof atoms.And radiation can cause a\nlot of this amorphization", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.435}, {"text": "by knocking the atoms about\nand having them freezein random configurations.This is one of the ways\nthat radiation damage canembrittle materials because--well, we'll get into that.So now let's talk\nabout the defectsthat can be created\nin a perfect crystal.The simplest ones, we\ncall point defects.They're zero-dimensional\nbecause they're justsingle atoms out of place.You can have what's called\na vacancy, where if you had,let's say, a face-centered\ncubic lattice of atoms,where you have atoms on every\ncube corner and every face,if you just pull\none out somewhere,we refer to that as a vacancy.A missing atom.It had to go somewhere,\nthough, and we'llget to where it is\nin just a second.So it might be kind of hard\nto conceptualize, how do weknow that there are missing\natoms in all these little cubesor lattices?We do have direct evidence.They're what's called\nquenching studies,where you can measure the\nresistance or resistivityof a piece of material\nafter heating itto a certain temperature.Because it turns out that the\nhotter you make something,the more of those vacancies\njust naturally occur.You won't actually ever\nfind an absolutely perfectsingle crystal\nanywhere in nature,unless you go to zero\nKelvin for infinite time,then the atoms arrange\nthemselves thusly.There's always some amount\nof atomic vibration going on.And there's actually some\nthermodynamic energy gainto having a few defects\nin your structure.And that number of\ndefects increaseswith increasing temperature.Once you get to the melting\npoint of a material,or like right before something\nmelts, you can have up to 1in 10,000 atoms just missing.Moved somewhere else.We call that the\nthermal equilibriumvacancy concentration.And we can measure that using\nthese resistivity measurements,where you heat materials up to\nhigher and higher temperatures,cool them down suddenly\nin, like, liquid nitrogenor liquid helium, and measure\nthe change in resistivity.The more defects there are,\nthe harder it is for electrons", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.368}, {"text": "to flow through.And the only thing that could\nreally be responsible therein a single element\nwould be vacancies.So we do know that\nthese really exist.They can also cluster up.It turns out that\nevery time you havea vacancy in a material,\nthe other atomsmove in a little bit towards\nit, relaxing the pressure theyfeel from the atoms nearby.And one way for a whole\nbunch of vacanciesto lower the stress of the\nwhole atomic configurationis to cluster together.So if you have a whole\nbunch of vacancies,they may not allow as\nmuch stress accommodationas if they were separate,\nwhen they're together.Now you might ask, what\nhappened to the original atoms?You can't just take atoms\naway and then go nowherebecause you can't just\ndestroy matter, right?Unless you turn it\ninto energy, whichis what we do in\nnuclear engineering.So in the material\nscience world,they end up as what's\ncalled interstitials,where you kind of have a\nvacancy created from somewherethat knocks that\natom out, and itgets stuck in the next biggest\nspace between some other atoms.And we refer to those\nas interstitials.And those can cluster up, too,\nto reduce their total stressin the lattice.They can cluster up into\nwhat's called split dumbbellinterstitials.Instead of having one\nextra atom shoved in here,you might rearrange\na couple so there'stwo atoms in the center\nof a cube instead of one.And that tends to be a lower\nenergy or a more stableconfiguration.So let's look a little bit at\nthe energetics of these pointdefects because\nunderstanding how they moveand why will tell us a lot about\nhow radiation damage happens.So it turns out\nthat interstitialsare very hard to make.It's really hard\nto shove an atomwhere it doesn't want to be.But once you get it there,\nit moves very easily.Let's draw a quick,\nsimple cubic latticeto do a little\nthought experimentand explore why that might be.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.35}, {"text": "Let's say I want to shove\nan interstitial atom in herebetween these other atoms.Well their electron\nclouds are going to repel,and it's going to push\nall the nearby atoms awayby just a little bit.And these ones might\npush the other atoms awayby just a little bit,\nstretching out the lattice,or adding some\ncompressive stresswherever that interstitial is.But then how would it move?What's the biggest\nbarrier it hasto overcome to get to the\nnext adjacent location?Well, which direction\nwould it go?Would it go this way?Probably not.There's an atom in the way.So it's going to find the\npath of least resistanceto try to get over here,\nbecause like we've talked aboutbefore, all atoms\nare always in motion.Vibrating.Some of them will\nbe energetic enoughto squeeze through\nthese two atomsand get over to the next site.And that turns out to be\na pretty easy process.We can look at the energy\nrequired for an interstitialto move.We notice it's really small\nfractions of an electron volt,whereas creating them takes\ntwo or three electron volts.In atomic land, that's a\nvery high energy penalty.Now let's look at vacancies.They're quite the opposite.They're rather easy\nto make but they'revery hard to move,\ncompared to interstitials.Notice that the\nenergy of movementis about the same as the energy\nof formation for vacancies.To take an atom out\nor to pluck it out,you have to break every\nbond between nearby atoms.So you actually have to put\nenergy in to break those bondsand then remove the\natoms somewhere else.Now these things are\nusually made in pairs,so if you think about\nhow much energy would ittake to cause a single radiation\ndamage event where you haveone vacancy, which let's say\nwould have been right here,and one interstitial, it takes\nthe sum of these two energies--", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.299}, {"text": "usually about four\nelectron volts.That's not something\nthat tends to happenchemically or from stress\nor from something like that.But radiation coming\nin with hundreds of keVor even MeV neutrons,\nanything's on the tablebecause it's high enough energy.Yeah?AUDIENCE: What would take\nabout three or four eV?PROFESSOR: So it would\ntake about three or foureV to make a pair of a\nvacancy and an interstitial.If you just add these two up.It comes usually to about three\nor four eV, or electron volts.And that's a very\ndifficult thingto do in sort of chemical world,\nwhere reactions might proceedwith fractions of\nan electron volt.But when you have MeV\nneutrons coming in,they do whatever they want.They'll do whatever they will.So someone actually\nasked me yesterday,what sort of materials can\nyou put in the way of neutronsto stop them from doing damage?And the answer is,\npretty much nothing.Fast neutrons tend to travel\nabout 10 centimeters, evenin things like steel\nor water, and they'regoing to hit what\nthey're going to hit.There's not much you can do\nbut put more things in the way.And we can only get to a certain\ndensity with regular matter.And I think osmium has\nupwards of, like, 22 gramsper cubic centimeter density.That's not enough\nto stop neutrons,even over a\nconsiderable distance.Unless you had, like,\nliquid neutron star,that you could pack nuclei in\nat a way higher number density,not much you can do.So moving up in the\ndimensions, there'sanother type of defect\ncalled a dislocation, whereit's actually energetically\nfavorable to slidean extra half-plane of atoms\nin between two sets in herein the crystal lattice, creating\na sort of bulged-out structurelike you see right here.And dislocations are one of\nthe most important defectsin material science\nand radiation damage.They're what I like to call\nthe agents of plasticity.If you deform a material\nenough that it doesn't just", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.293}, {"text": "spring back, then most likely,\nyou were creating and movingdislocations in the material.If you think about a\ncouple of different waysto cause deformation--let's bring our\nperfect lattice backwithout all these\nextra notations.If you want to slide or shear\ntwo planes of atoms across,and they're all\nbonded to each other,what do you\nphysically have to do?How can you get these atoms\nto slide across each other?What sort of energy do\nyou have to put into it?Yeah?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] energy.PROFESSOR: Yep.Because all these atoms\nare bonded to each other,if you want them\nto move, you haveto break every\nbond on that plane.That's a lot of\natomic bonds to breakand it's extremely unlikely\nthat that would happen.In fact, if you broke\nan entire plane of bondsin some material like this, what\nwould you physically do to it?You'd snap it in half.That would be fracture.So if you broke every\nbond down this plane,you would then have two\npieces of this fuel rod.That's usually a pretty\nhigh-energy thing to try to do.So instead, if you\nshove an extra halfplane of atoms in\nthere, and the bondsare kind of funny like so,\nright at that extra half-planelocation, then what you can\nactually do is break one.Let's say you break this\none, form the next one,then break this one\nand form the next one.And for a few\natoms to move over,you only have to break a\nline of bonds, not a plane.So it's much less\nenergy-intensive to get", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.162}, {"text": "a dislocation to move than to\njust break something in half.Now you might ask, well, then\nwhy do things actually break?Whether or not things\ndeform or breakis a balance between this\nprocess, which we call slip,and breaking an entire plane of\natoms, which we call fracture.So this one's called slip.The other mode is fracture.We would rather materials to\nform in systems like reactorsby slip, just\nmoving a little bit,then just breaking altogether.Unfortunately, when enough\nradiation hits materials,you can fracture things\nin a brutal manner,and we'll see what happens then.There's a couple\nkinds of dislocations.One of them is called\na screw dislocation.So imagine you had a whole\nbunch of sheets of atoms,and you made a cut\nhalfway through that sheetand then moved every\nplane up by one position.You then got what's called\na screw dislocation--kind of a spiral parking\ngarage of atoms surroundingthat core right there.You can also have what's called\nan edge dislocation, whichis like the one I've\ngot here on the boardright here, where you just have\nan extra half plane of atomsshoved in right there.So there's two types, and they\nmove in two different ways.The edge dislocation behaves\nlike you may physically expect.If you kind of push like\nthis on two planes of atoms,it moves in the\ndirection you push it.Screw dislocations\nare kind of screwy.If you push like this,\nit moves perpendicular.Not going to get into\nwhy, but just remember,screw dislocations are\nfairly screwy in the waythat they behave.Not quite intuitive.But that's OK.We don't have to\nworry about those.And the way that\nthey actually move,like we showed right here, is\nby what's called glide, or slip,where dislocations can slide\njust by one plane of atomsor one atomic position\nin a mechanism that", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.124}, {"text": "looks something like this.Where, as that\ndislocation moves,you only have to\nbreak a line of bondsand then reform a\nline of bonds, whichis a much easier\nprocess than breakingan entire plane at once.It's like you have to\nbreak the square rootof the same number of bonds.I'm going to skip ahead\nthrough some of that.There's one other mechanism\nof dislocation movementthat's important to\nus in radiation damageand that's called climb.This is when you\nstart to think about,what happens if you have\na dislocation, which we'llgive this symbol right here,\nand you also have a vacancy,let's say created\nby radiation damage.If that vacancy can\nmove, it's goingto find the most stressed-out\npart of this lattice.Most likely, the\nvacancy will move here.In other words, the atom\nwill move over there,leaving this vacancy over there.It's kind of funny to\nthink, like, what does itmean that a vacancy moves?Has anyone ever done\nanything with semiconductorsand talked about electron\nand hole movement?OK, yeah.So what does it really mean\nfor a hole to move, right?A hole's not a thing.A vacancy's also not a thing.It's an absence of an atom.But here, we can say\nthat the vacancy movesin this direction when the\ncorresponding atom movesin the exact opposite direction.And then what\nyou've actually doneis moved your dislocation up.Instead of moving in\nthe slip direction,you've now moved it in a\nperpendicular direction.This is usually not\npossible without thingslike radiation damage or\nvery high temperature.And then, to make\nthings even crazier,you can also have\nwhat's called loopsof dislocation, some videos\nof which I'll actuallyget to show you.You can have a dislocation that\nhas part edge character, partscrew character.If you look at how the\natoms are arranged here,you're looking from\nsort of the top-down.You can see that\nthere's an extra half", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.198}, {"text": "plane of these white atoms\nshoved in in the black ones,and this right here

push in this direction\non an edge dislocation,it moves that way.When you push this direction\non a screw dislocation,it moves that way.So when you stress out\na dislocation loop,it just grows.You're not actually creating\nor destroying matter,but what you're doing is causing\nthis small loop of extra halfplane of atoms to grow further\nand further until it actuallyreaches some obstacle or\nthe outside of a crystal.And these dislocations\ncan actuallyfeel the force from each other.If I draw a clean one because I\nthink it'll be easier to see--if I draw a small\nlattice of atomshere and then a dislocation\ncore right there.So that's our dislocation core.This region of space right\nhere is compressively stressed.There's more atoms in that\nspace than there want to beand so it's kind

up.Those dislocations\ntend to line upin energetically-favorable\ndirections, and in this grain,they're all this\nway, and in the twin,they're all lined up like that.And then finally, there's\nthe most intuitive defect,inclusions.A 3-D piece of some other\nmaterial inside whatwould otherwise be\na pure material.This one, I actually pulled\nout of the rotor that powersthe Alcator fusion reactor.I was asked to do some\nanalysis to find out,is the structure of\nthat rotor changing,because General Electric who\nwas insuring this rotor said,we don't want to\ninsure it anymore.Thanks for the premiums, but\nwe're not insuring it anymore.And we said, why?And they said, oh, it's\nstructurally unsound.So we said, oh yeah?We'll be back in a year\nand we'll talk about it.And we did a lot of\nthis work to find outthat, actually, the structure\nhadn't really changedsince 1954 when it was made.But what we did also\nsee is we could pop outlittle precipitates\nof manganese sulfide.", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.139}, {"text": "So there's always\nsulfur in iron,and sulfur tends to\nbe a bad actor when itcomes to material properties.You throw manganese\ninto iron to scoop upthat sulfur in the form of\nthese little precipitatesor inclusions, which we\nwere able to see perfectlywhen we did an x-ray\nmap, just like the one wedid after the first exam.It's like we were looking at\nChris' copper silver alloy,mapping out where is\nthe copper and silver.I made this image the\nsame way, mapping out,where is there iron,\nmanganese and sulfur.That's how you can\ntell what it is.And so dislocations and\ndefects can actually interact.Let's say this is\nthe interactionof a 1-D defect, a dislocation,\nwith a 3-D defect, a void.If you have a material\nthat's deforming plastically,very smoothly, and isn't\ngoing to undergo fracture,you want the dislocations\nto be able to move.If you put anything in their\nway, they tend to get stuck.It's not easy for\nthat dislocationto shear through a whole\nbunch of extra atoms.And in some cases, you can\nstop that motion and favorfracture over slip.So any time you\nmake slip harder,it means that you're making\nfracture more likely.I didn't say you're\nmaking it easier,but you're making\nit more likely.And you would\nprefer for materialsto deform a little bit by a slip\nthan just break by fracture.So I think now is a good point\nto go over a few key materialproperties.All of these are sometimes\nused to describe the same thingin colloquial speech.That is wrong.Has anyone here thought\nthat, let's say,stiffness or toughness or\nstrength meant the same thing?No.OK.A few people.It's OK.Because it's used wrong all\nthe time in colloquial speech.These actually refer to\ndifferent material propertieswith different units.And we're going to go into\na little bit about what theyare and then show\nyou a few videos", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.118}, {"text": "to test your intuition about\nthe differences between them.So first, I want to mention\nwhat you're seeing right here.It's called a\nstress-strain curve.Stress is simple.Stress is just a force\ndivided by an area.And usually, the\ncriterion for willa material deform\nor will it breakis does it reach\na certain stress.It doesn't matter just how\nmuch force you put on it,but it's like, how\nmuch force per atomor how much force per area\ndetermines whether bondsare going to break.And so on the y-axis is stress.Let's say the amount of force\nper area we're putting in.And strain is the\namount of deformation.So that's stress.And strain is, let's\nsay, the change in lengthover the original length\nof some material in what'scalled the engineering\nor simplified notation.And so something\nthat is stiff meansyou can put a lot\nof force into itbut it won't deform very much.That's kind of the easiest\nproperty to understand.Is something that's\nvery stiff willhave what's called a\nhigh Young's modulus,or a high slope right here.Something that's super\nstiff, like a ceramic,you could really push\non it quite a bit,but you won't get it to deform\nlike you would this metal.So the opposite of stiff,\nI would call compliant.Not soft.This is one of those\ntricky things right there.Something that's stiff, you try\nand flex it and it won't flex.Something that's compliant,\nyou put a little bit of forceinto it and it undergoes\nsome amount of strain.And that slope right\nthere between the stressand the strain, we call\nthe Young's modulus.We also note that\nthis part right hereis what's called the elastic\nregion of deformation.By elastic, we mean reversible,\nor it snaps right back.So right here, when I bend this\nbar and it snaps right back,that's called\nelastic deformation.And it's reversible,\nbecause you can bend one way", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.132}, {"text": "and it snaps right back.If I bent it more,\nwhich I don't wantto do because this is a nice\nzirconium fuel cladding rod,you would deform\nit irreversibly.You'd bend it permanently.And to undergo what's called\nplastic deformation, whenyou deviate from the slope, and\nthen a little bit more stresscan cause a lot\nmore deformation.Have any of you guys ever\ntried pulling copper wireapart before?That's something I'd recommend\nyou try, for thin wireso you don't cut your hands.What you may notice is that\nit's awfully hard to getthe copper deforming\nin the first place,but as soon as it starts to\nstretch, it gets really easy.So this is something\nI recommend.Go to the electronics\nshop or whereverand try it out on some\nreally thin copper wire.If it's thick, you'll\nslice through your fingersand you don't want to do that.Strength, however, that's\na different metric.Whereas stiffness\ndescribes the slope here,strength describes the height,\nor the stress at which youstart to plastically deform.They're in different units.Stiffness is in\nstress over strain,whereas strength is\ngiven as a stress.So when you hear\nthings like the yieldstress or the ultimate\ntensile strength,that's referring to how\nstrong something is,which may have nothing to\ndo with how stiff it is.Toughness is another property.Toughness is actually kind of\nlike the area under this curve,because if you do a force\nand apply it over a distance,that's like putting\nwork into the materialand it ends up being\na unit of energy.So toughness will tell\nyou how much energyyou have to put into\nsomething before creatinga new free surface,\notherwise known as fracture.And ductility is how much can\nyou deform it before it breaks.So it would be like this point\nright here on the strain axis.So I'll give a little\nbit more examplesof what this is all about.Toughness, again,\nis actually measured", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.131}, {"text": "as an energy required\nto form a free surface,or propagate a crack, let's say.Whereas something\nthat's ductile,it doesn't necessarily\nmean that it's tough.Like, if you have a piece\nof chewed chewing gum,you can stretch it quite a\nlot with very little energy.And then you can say it's\nextremely ductile but notvery strong.A piece of copper\nwire, you can alsostretch it an\nextremely far distance,but it takes more\nenergy to do so.So that's both\nductile and strong.And then if you apply that\nforce over a certain distance,stretching out the\nwire, you can alsoreveal some of its toughness\nand how much energyit takes to stretch that\nwire before it breaks.Hardness is the last material\nproperty I want to mention,which is not any of\nthe ones that I showedon the stress-strain curve.Hardness is the\nresistance to a little bitof plastic deformation.So assuming that\nyou're already here,how much more energy\ndo you have to put into get the material\nto deform plastic?So very different\nmaterial properties.I'll try and mention\nall what they are.So if we have a\nstress-strain curve like so,and it follows\nthe elastic regionand then deforms\nplastically, this pointhere is what we call\nthe yield strength.Whatever that point\non the stress axis is.This point right here,\nour strain to failure,we can use as a\nmeasure of ductility.This slope right here\nrefers to the stiffness.And finally, this\nenergy right hereis something like the toughness.And the hardness isn't\nquite on this plot.",

dislocations\npiling up against each otherduring plastic deformation,\nyou can undergo a processcalled work hardening.That process can be\nphysically describedby a lot of those dislocations\npiling up
