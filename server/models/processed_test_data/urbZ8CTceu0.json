lazyimpossible alright so here we where weleft off we had the cavity or theresonator that gave us these modes andthe spacing between them is C over 2l aswe mentioned and now we put theamplifier within this cavity to overcomethe losses and I say in general thelosses come from from the mirrors and ifthere's enough gain here let's say thisis the location of the gain in frequencyand if there is enough gain at thiscavity resonance then we will get lazyand we'll get the light output by makingthis mirror not 100% reflective but alittle bit has a little transmissionthis mirror here so we can leak some thelight out so the then the spectral widthof the laser then narrows down frominitially this to to this essentiallythis Delta function is Delta F goingclose to zero and then in the timedomain we get as a result of thisknowing we get a wave train that's apure sinusoid constant in frequency andconstant in amplitude and that's thesort of the output of a of a typicalwhat shall we say an ideal an ideallaser so now if if somebody then asks", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.563}, {"text": "you where does where why does the laserhave a very narrow spectral width thenone can then say that it comes from thefact that we have an optical amplifierinwithin a within a resonator with enoughgain to overcome the losses to give usthis extremely narrow line now I'm goingto then tell you about how the nextproperty the one that that has to dowith diffraction-limited collimation andfocusing and so on where does thisproperty come from again in asimple-minded way at this stage andlater on we'll go into it in a littlebit more more depth well the this thespatial properties really come from thefact of course that we have an amplifierwithin within the resonator and we havethese two mirrors let's take two planemirrors for example and we'll see laterthat that indeed the the mode that canbe supported within that within thatcavity is is essentially a parallel beamthat gets reflected backwards andforwards between these two mirrors andthe amplifier then overcomes the lossesin the cavity and this mirror has littletransmission so the output here youwould expect to be a collimated beam aplane a plane wave with diffractionlimited collimation and if you put alens will be diffraction limitedfocusing now not all laser cavities haveplane mirrors some of them have curvedmirrors like in this case two concavemirrors again the mode shape as we'llsee later will be will be different fromthis will be something like that andthen if we let some of the light leakout through one of the curved mirrorsyou'll see it it will be diverging justbecause it's diverging it doesn't meanthat it's a bad beam it just means thatwith lenses we can convert it to anysized beam we want and focus it and andso on so it's really it's the cavityplus the amplifier that that gives us", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.31}, {"text": "this very uniform wave that we we talkedabout before in fact if we can shape thethe output of the laser beam is thesetwo outputs excuse me with with lensesand then we can create here's some smallfocus spot here maybe slightly biggerfocus we can then create a narrower callmade it beam from what we started withor larger collimating and so on it's alldone with with the use of good opticsoutside outside the laser cavity so thisall these properties to do with the withthe spatial effect of the laser beamthen come from from the cavity plus theamplifier all right now we want to talkabout where where does high power comefrom excuse mewell the high power comes from obviouslyfrom the from the amplifier because it'sthe amplifier that that gives us gain toovercome the losses and if we have moregain left then that can be converted toto power out so this so the the biggerthe amplifier then the more power we'llget as simple as thatso sooner this later we will find outabout how an amplifier works so if wecan come up with a bigger amplifier andhow to make a big amplifier then we'llreally know the secret of making makinghigh-power lasers so it's in the handsof the of the amplifying the the tuningthe tuning range where does the tuningrange come from well let me give youagain a very simple simple explanationlet's go back to to the laser that wehad two mirrors separated by distance Lin a cavity and then we had the cavitymode over here and then this is the theamplified bandwidth this is where theamplifier likes to provide gain and thenwe said that the output of the laser", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.272}, {"text": "would be would be this delta function atthe cavity resonance now these modeshere are not fixed because they dependon on L so if I change L the length ofthe cavity I can move these modes aroundso if I move this cavity mode around ifI moved it just a little bit here thenthis frequency here will be dragged thelaser frequency will be dragged with itand the tuning range is really the widthof the bat of the bandwidth of the ofthe amplifier because if I tune thecavity outside that I get no outputoutput at all now here is a an amplifierthat has a bandwidth that's bigger thanwhat I showed you beforewhich means now that the tuning rangecan be can be wider now depending againis say on the width on the bandwidth ofthe of the amplifier and if I in thisparticular case if this mode leaves theamplifier this end there's the other onethat will come in so I will always getsome output from the laser but theintensity can can vary depending onwhere I am with respect to ganker whileover here in this previous one if themode is outside the amplified bandwidthI get no light output at allso since so then the in summary then thetuning of a laser then depends on thebandwidth of the amplifier the wider thebandwidth the the wider the tuning rangeokay so now the the remaining propertythat we talked about before is the isthe very short pulse width generation sothe question is with us where does thiscome from again in a simplesimple-minded way again here to explainthis I need to to give you a little bitof a background and then start with withwhat we've done before if you had adelta function in in frequency space thein the time domain you have essentiallyan oscillation a sinusoidal oscillationwith a constant amplitude and a constant", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.34}, {"text": "frequency this is what you know we'vebeen talking about before now if Ilooked at the intensity remember this isnow at optical frequency maybe 10 to the15 Hertz or so so it's very highfrequency I cannot observe it I don'thave any way of observing it but if Ilooked at the intensity associated withthis using a square law detector what Iget is essentially a constant outputconstant intensity output associatedwith this way so if I have then a deltafunction in frequency I have thenintensity would be would be constant sothis is completely opposite togeneration of short short pulse this isessentially you know CW CW laser but nowlet's let's see what happens to thisconstant output when I add when I addanother frequency if I have now twofrequencies let's say that's that areoscillating one at F onef2 here they are different in wavelengthand difference in the frequencyseparated let's say by F sub s now inthe when I look at that when I combinethem and look at them in the time domainI get something like this which is likea beat frequency or is a beat frequencythe the the period between these Peaks tbig t is just simply 1 over F sub s theseparation in frequency but the actly ifyou look at the intensity associatedwith this wave looks something like thiswhich is the envelope of this beat it'sno longer constant just by simply addingtwo ways of different frequencies andwe're all familiar with beating effectsof when two singers sing with twodifferent two different frequencies thenyou'll hear the beat so basically nowI've transformed a constant intensity toa to assign a soil intensity it's notquite a short pulse yet but it's it'ssort of getting there alright so nowlet's look at let's look at what happenswhen we add another yet another", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.455}, {"text": "frequency alright here it is now we havethree F 1 F 2 F 3 they are in the timedomain I add them up and then give mesome waveform like this when I Squarethis I get the intensity to look likethis as you can see now this width isbeginning to look like a pulse but againnot quite again the the repetitionbetween these two peaks the periodbetween here and here the time betweenthe two peaks or the two sort of pulsesat this stage is again 1 over FS whereFS is the spacing between these modesand we're assuming they are constantconstant spacing between thesefrequencies now you can think you canadd more and more frequencies and let'ssee and let's see what what happens nowI've simplified the picture and I justput the intensity output that we've hadbefore remember when we had only 1 wasconstant intensity when we had to we wehave this sinusoidal behavior 3 is likethis 4 if you add 4 begins like this 8if you eight then now it's beginning tolook like a pulse and then when you goto 16 frequencies that areinstantly space then indeed begins toreally look like a like a pulse theperiodokay the separation between these pulsestrains is again 1 over F as thefrequency spacing between the modes andthe pulse width which is the key thinghere the pulse width pulse width isgiven by 1 times n the number of ofmodes times F sub s so n times F sub sis really the the total separation infrequency between the first and the lastand the last frequencies or modesalright so then then you can see herethat the shorter the pulse alright ifyou want a very short pulse then youwant to make n time some FS very largewhich means either n is very large or Fsub s is is very large or it's certainlythe product has to be very large so whenthat's the bandwidth of the essentially", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.28}, {"text": "the of this the spectrum of these ofthese modesso the key thing then is to have let'ssay in this caselots of modes lots of modes extendingover a wide frequency range and and thenthat would give us this this short shortpulse alright big question now is wherecan we find all these frequencies fromin a lazy alright so so let's let's goback and remind ourselves what we justmentioned about lasers we said that ifwe have a wide gain bandwidth gainmedium amplifier and we have then lotsof modes lots of cavity modes under thethis this amplifier then and if there'senough gain to overcome the losses inall these modes and I would getessentially for four frequencies wellbefore we only talked about one but nowI can generate four frequencies out ofthis amplifier if the amplifier allowsme to oscillate at all these frequencythat's all very nice so we can see thatthis is the beginning of of having manymodes so if you can imagine an amplifierthat has this has much bigger bandwidthin this then I can have more and moremore of these modes oscillating alrightand then so of course if I have justremind you if I have you know sixteen ofthem then essentially and in a certainspacing between them but basically I canget a narrow pulse coming out of thelaser here without essentially doinganything now the I didn't mention acertain key key issue here and that iswhen and then we can go back and showyou when we when I combine the sinewaves I mean let me go back to this thisviewgraph here when I combine these sine", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.214}, {"text": "waves here you know the the these waveshad to be in phase somewhere they had tostart start together and if they don'tthen you wouldn't get this kind ofbehavior because if the relative phasesare way off and different than thenyou're in real trouble so so the let mesee if I can find my view graph here andthis shows that what happens when whenall the sixteen modes in this case areall in phase or start together thenindeed this is what I'll get I get thispulse width as given by 1 over NFS sothis is a special condition I have tosatisfy in order to generate this narrowpulse width and here's an example whathappens if only ten of the sixteen startin phase and not all sixteen of themthen I get a messy looking output likethis and it's not like this at all so inorder to to generate very short pulsesout of out of lasers then then I need toget all these modes under the gain curveto start together and that is the thetopic of of phase locking or modelocking and we will talk about thatlater so so lasers can generate veryvery short pulses only if you can getall the modes all these modes to go andand they have to start together theyhave to be phase locked or mode lockedandso on and with that that's the output ofthe laser becomes the series of shortpulses and if the bandwidth of theamplifier is very very broad then youcan get these short pulses likepicoseconds and and shorter alright sonow we've talked about so far we'vetalked about the unique properties oflasers we talked about in a simple wayhow these properties come about now", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.206}, {"text": "we're ready to to put all that stufftogether and see how how a typicalsimple

you at this stage thethe lasers that that we have simple onesgo helium neon laser and because theamplifier is a helium neon amplifyingwe'll talk about how that works in alittle while now here the they have twokinds of lasers one where the theamplifier tube is terminated by the twomirrors and and the called internalmirror laser and the other one and thisis quite typical for a lot of laserswhere the

laser at least a helium neonlaser they all different ah now what Iwould like you to see here is that it'smade up of a discharge tube which isthis which is the the amplifier that isnecessary for laser action and then thedischarge tube is terminated by by twomirrors here's a mirror on on this sideyou can see it is one mirror and andhere is here is the other mirror okayso it's a it's a small this is

about how does a lightamplifier work so this is what I havenow for the next topic is it how doesreally an optical amplifier really workthe so what what we mean by an opticalamplifier we need light going in to thismagic box here and we need the lightenhanced or increased or amplified atthe at the other endso the question is what is this magicbox here that takes light from one endand actually amplifies it and sends itout at the other endall right that's that's the key questionthe so in order to answer this we haveto we have to see what we understandabout the interaction of radiation orlight with atoms or moleculesso let's let's start with that now we'revery familiar for example with lightinteracting with the material andgetting absorbed that we see that allthe time that sometimes completelyabsorbed and sometimes it's notcompletely absorbed like a piece ofglass for example if you send lightthrough a piece of glass its uncoatednormally incidents and so on you loseabout 8% or so for both both sunny so", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.545}, {"text": "other materials will lose more and thenwe see that all the time all right sofirst let's understand what that is andonce we understand what absorption isthen then let's see how then we canunderstand amplification so we'll startfirst by looking at absorption all rightso here is the in order to understandabsorption we need a model for for theapp all right and as I say in thiscourse we keep everything very simple sothat we can get a basic intuitive kindof understanding of what's going onrather than complicate things with a lotof math now a model for for an atom allright is where let's say an atom hasseveral energy levels or orbits or whathave you and the atom is the ball here'sthe atom is is in its ground state orlowest energy state at at the beginningand all atoms essentially are at thelowest energy States at the beginningnow when light comes in from over herelet's say these are two photons comingin they will interact with the electronsat say in this atom and will excite theelectrons to to some higher state oreven higher States in this case I'm onlytaking a very simple model just to levelsystemnow if the if the light wavelength lightfrequency is not correct the the atomwill not be all the electrons here willnot be excited at all but if the lightfrequency or wavelength is a certainvalue of a certain value then the theelectrons here can be excited and I'mnow on I'm going to call it the atomscan be can be excited from one level toanother level and when the atom is isexcited from one level to another levelthen essentially it takes it takesenergy from the light or it takesphotons from the light to to get excitedbecause now the the the atom itself has", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.539}, {"text": "now higher energy than he started withand the of course the light gave up itsenergy to to the atom so it has lessenergy when when it leaves the app andthis is generally called absorption andthen let's say a few more words aboutthat here again this picture that I hadin terms of just straight waves here isa big wave coming in and a little wavecoming out and that essentially is isabsorption I've labeled here e1 and e2for the energy levels and it turns outthat the frequency where you get maximumabsorption or the wavelength orfrequency you get maximum absorption isis given by the difference in energy e2minus e1 divided by H which is Planck'sconstant and that gives you thefrequency that of at resonance and ifyou for example put put you put adetector out here and you can see thatas you tune the frequency of the of thislight source you have no absorption atthe beginning that all the intensitycomes through and then when you're closeto resonance what you will see is youdip like this and back to no absorptionso over here there is some absorptionand this absorption occurs at thisresonance frequency determined by theenergy level difference divided byPlanck's constantokay the wavelength of course isproportional to that as you knowfrequency times wavelength equals thespeed of light so that either you talkaboutsequences or wavelength in this courseI'd like to talk about frequency becauseit's easier to talk about frequenciesand then wavelength the now if again thethe amount of absorption will depend onon the number of atoms or molecules thatyou have and the width for theabsorption again depends on theparticular transition in that particularatom now if you don't believe me you can", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.663}, {"text": "do an experiment and here's how youmight do the the experiment you takethis variable wavelength light sourceand you send it into selected vapor avapor cell and you put a detector at theother endagain you have now lots of atoms let'ssay or molecules you send the light inand some of these going to be excitedyou're going to go into this excitedstate and the light is reduced andthat's what what we call a stimulatedabsorption and then we generate the samecurve as we had before so if you look atthe app of the detector as a function offrequency or wavelength then you wouldsee you would see this dip occurring atthis resonant frequency and this way youcheck out where this absorption occursand and the width the width of it nowthe interesting thing here is that younote you'll notice that if this is aglass tube you'll notice the radiationcoming out the other side now thatradiation is when you see before the theexcitation all the atoms were in theground state and that radiates there wasno radiation coming out from the signbut when when you excite these atoms toan excited state then another processcomes in that's called spontaneousemission because these atoms that are inthe excited state in lots of cases theydon't like to stay up there they like toto come down and when they decay socalled decay when they decay they emit aphoton in a random direction and thewavelength or frequency of this photonis is equal to two the one that broughtit brought it up so essentially thelight that was absorbed from from theoriginal beam is now sent into into allthese directions okay so now we'velearned about what stimulated absorptionis and what spontaneousspontaneous emission ease question iswhat about game what we're after isamplification all right so let's see howamplification then comes about now foramplification to understand", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.449}, {"text": "amplification of light we reverse thepicture instead of starting with theatom in the ground state which way itlikes to be normally we're going tostart with the atom in the excited stateso when when a photon comes in now thereis no absorption that can take place butwhat can happen if the again if thefrequency or wavelength of this photonis just right at the resonance frequencyof this transition then what it what canhappen is that this light now will forcethis atom to come down because it'slet's say there's no other energy levelto go up it can even push it up if therewas an energy level here then it couldkick it up but in this particular casewe say we only have two levels so theonly way for this atom to go is down andthen of course when when an atom comesdown remember Adam had energy up herewhen it comes down it will release aphoton okay so so this photon let's sayis the original photon here and thisphoton over here is due to the releaseof the photon from from this excitedatom as it gets pushed by by this sourcehere so now what we're seeing we'reseeing that we're getting two photonsokay when coming out when we had onlyone going in and as a result of of theexcited atom has been pushed down to theground state and this is the theessential or the basics of stimulatedstimulated emission or gain because nowhere you see that light light can beamplified alright so let's talk a littlebit more more about this as I saidbefore just like in absorption theresonance frequency is again determinedby the energy level difference dividedby Planck's constant all right now inthis particular case if what you seewhen you watch at the output you seethat indeed the light gets increases nowinstead of decreases we had before whenyou

number of atoms andin this case number of atoms in theexcited state and would be exactly thesame as if the process were reversed andall the atoms were in the ground stateand the size of the absorption would beexactly the same as the size of theamplification and certainly the widthsare the same and again if you don't ifyou don't believe me you do a littleexperiment alright and you do thislittle experiment here you take a lightsource and tunable light source and nowyou send it into into this amplifierwe're not saying what kind of amplify itis right now but basically it's a it's away of amplifying light it's anamplifier that can amplify light soagain you take this light source tunableyou send it in and you measure theoutput on a detective basically this isthe this is the amplifier has all theatoms that say in the this excited stateyou send the light coming in and if youhit the resonance is that we hit theresonance and you start driving some ofthese atoms down and the output isessentially going to be bigger than thethan the input just like we said beforeat a certain frequency you're going toget you're going to get theamplification of the slide now whatabout the while we're at this what aboutthe spontaneous emission because beforewe said when on all the atoms are in theexcited state there will be aspontaneous emission well that's truebecause if you wait long enough see ifyou had a condition like this wherethere's no light coming in all the atomsare excited if you wait long enough thenall these atoms will decay spontaneouslyby themselves emitting light in all",

not available forfor amplification so the whole secretthen of amplification is to make surethat the these atoms here are used up togenerate amp gain to come down driven bythis field here and not by an out dropdown by themselves and emit spontaneousemission that's a tricky thing and youhave to make sure you can handle thatnow to summarize amplification is thefollowing we need four for whether Ijust look at loss first when when wehave a loss loss lossy device it meansthat we have before we only talked aboutone atom let's say in a state here I canput lots of atoms or molecules in let'ssay in the ground state but fewer in thein the excited state so if there is morein the lower than the upper level thenthe net effect is absorption so if N 1which is the number in the lower levelis bigger than n 2 then the net effectis absorption gain is when there is morein the upper than low because if n 2 isbigger than n 1 and we have net gain andfrom now on I'll be referring to it as apopulation inversion because normallyatoms like to be in the ground state tostart with and not in the in the excitedstate so I have to as we'll see later Ihave to do something to put the atoms uphere and and the it is the netdifference that will give me the willgive me the game ok so now it's only amatter of how to put more atoms in theupper state than in the lower state thatwill give me that will give me the game",

away notlooking at my my visuals let me go backto fundamentals again I have all theatoms let's say to start with here in atypical atomic system molecular systembut I need in order to get amplificationI have to have more in the upper thanthen the lower so I need a so-calledpump this pump could be as we'll seelater could be optical field could be adischarge lamp could be a laser could becollision could be all kinds of thingswe'll talk about later but basically fornow let's call it a pump and that's pumpthe job of this pump is take some ofthese atoms and put them upstairs hereotherwise you know right now it's likean absorbent this material acts like anabsorberover here it still looks like anabsorber because you have more in thelower than in the upper and as I keeptransferring atoms from lower level tothe upper level I get to a stage wherelet's say in this case I have 4 & 4 andit's not is neither gay nor absorptionif actually the material becomes

this case to startwith all the atoms are here in the lowerlevel to start with as usual then youfind put this pump and this pump againcould be optical pump or or whateverthis pump if it's if it resonates withthe transition now from the first to thethird level it can take some of theseatoms and put them and put them up herenow if we put them up here as soon asyou put some atoms up here there is apopulation difference between level 3and level 2 so now you haveamplification for for transitions forlight at this at this frequency but butiflook at level 1 and level 3 that's stillabsorption or what have you butcertainly no amplification so theamplification occurs as soon as you putone atom in level 3 because level 2 isis empty so you can create n 3 began n 2which is the condition for amplificationas soon as you pump one atom into thisinto this level so the amount of gainthat you get will depend of course on n3 minus n 2 on the population differenceas we talked before and there'll be aconstant and multiplies it that dependson again the particular transition theparticular atom and so onbut the key thing is that it's apopulation difference if n 3 is notbigger than n 2 and forget itthere is no gain so the frequency forthe amplification for the amplifiedlight will be at the at this transitionfrequency which is e 3 minus e 2 dividedby by H which is Planck's constant againif you want to do a experiment then thenyou do the then this is the followingexperiment you take again this amplifieryou take this tunable source and theamplifier now has a pump the pump thentakes atoms from

atleast the helium neon part as theamplifier and and and we do we willmeasure will actually measure amplyamplification of light we're allfamiliar with with absorption andattenuation of light but in thisparticular demonstration will beamplification of light so I think nowwe're ready toyou enjoy this demonstration so let's goand look at it as we have alreadylearned the most important component ina laser or the heart of the laser is thegain medium or the optical amplifierthis is no ordinary amplifier this is anamplifier for light and in thisdemonstration we're going to show youand hopefully convince you that indeedlight can be amplifying the amount ofamplification is not so huge but I'msure will make it convincing enough sothat you get the feel that indeed thatlight can be can be amplified the setupwe're going to use is is here you'regoing to have a laser which is going tobe a light source here's the here's theoutput of the of the laser we're goingto reflect it by this mirror

haveessentially are mounted here right belowokay so the then the output through thethrough this amplifier and the amplifierright now is turned off then goes on toonto a detector over here and then theoutput of the detector then goes on to ascope onto oscilloscope over here andand also we look at the output on a on adigital on a digital digital meteralright so we have two ways of lookingat the sameaim at the same output alright now we'reready to to set to set zero and so firstwhat I'm going to do is then block blockthe beam of light over here and let'slook at the zero on the scope and thezero on the on the meternow the meter says double zero eight isnot quite zero and the reason for thatis because we have room light hittingthe detector so what I'm going to do toget rid of that I'm going to put thislittle hood over the detector now we seethat the output of the of the meter nowis indeed is indeed zero and alsohopefully then the output of the scopehere this is will be our zero on

herewe are laser beams back again and thenwe get that same value again now we'reall familiar with absorption of lightand I just want to just demonstrate itjust for reference I'm going to put apiece of glass in front of the of thelaser beam and we know that glass normalincidence has reflectivity of about fourpercent per surface so I should get anattenuation of about eight percent or sowhen I put this piece of glass in the inthe beam of light now you can see themeter has dropped now to three thirtythree hundred and well if I can keep itstill three hundred twenty something andif I take the piece of glass away youknow we go up to the previous number ofthree sixty something so you can see wehave about an attenuation of abouteight or so percent nowwhat I'm going to do now is put thispiece of glass before the detector alsoand indeed I'm going to hold it againstthe the tube here so that I don't shaketoo much and again you can see that theattenuation is is also about about eightpercent or

demonstration of gain sonow I want you to then watch the boththe scope and and the meter as I turn onthe the amplifier so here I'm going tonow turn on the amplifier and rememberthis number is around three sixty threeor so three sixty four now you can seeon the scope we jumped a little bit andand the meter has gone up to threeeighty something which is an increase ofabout five percent and we turn it offagain you can see on the scope went downin fact just watch the scope for alittle while I'm going to turn it on andoff very fast so that you get a feelthat here goes up a little bit anddownload it since it's only a fewpercent it's difficult to see it on thescope the way I have it set it up haveit set up but it's much easier to see iton the meter so you can see that withamplification we have 380 something withno amplification then we're back to 360something again roughly it's about 5%amplificationnow you may wonder that maybe what we'regetting is when I turn on the amplifierthat we're getting light from theamplifier that hits histor detect it'snot really amplification so to provethis what I'm going to do is block thebeam of light going into the amplifierso that is no light going

it again on and and off so indeedwe've shown that light from theamplifier or spontaneous emission fromthe amplifier is not hitting thedetector and increasing the output soagain let me just redo it again for youhere is here is the light falling on thedetector without amplification again 360something and here comes theamplification again so yes close to 380a little bit less than we had beforemaybe the amplifier is getting a littleold here we arewithout amplification we have this valuenow I hope you've become a believer inthat you've seen for yourself that lightindeed can be can be amplifying the thelast topic before we leave this sessionis on how does the laser start you knowjust because we have inverted populationwe have between let's say level 3 andlevel 2 and but how does it laser reallystart we have gain yes but how does itget started because at the beginningthere was no light at this at thisfrequency of wavelengthall right there's plenty of pump lightbut there's no light to start thestimulated emission going but it turnsout that the light that the starts thelaser going is spontaneous emissionwe talked before when Adams are leftalone in the upper State they decay to alower level and they can emit photonsall right in all three directions nowthe spontaneous emission that the photon", "start": 3120.0, "heat": 0.205}, {"text": "that is emitted along the axis of

getsamplified and then hit some more getseven more amplified and so on as he goesbackwards and forward then this buildsup and and you get enough gain toovercome the losses and the laser willoscillate and if one of the mirrors hassome transmission then you get you getthe output so indeed that's how anamplifier works and that's how a lasergets started and then when we come backfor our next session
