giantmosquito button your neck and you go tofilm a YouTube video you can't help butnotice it so my wife did this let youlet her know in the comments if you likethe scarf with stitch besides that let'sget to guitar fundamentals three easysteps for any beginner intermediateguitar player to sound better and betterevery time the reason I want to presentthis video is because in case you'recamping with your family like I was overthe weekend or if you're just playingwith people or family comes over andthey say hey you play guitar playsomething these are some things that youcan do to enhance your playing rightaway but not only that it's also howmusic totally works it's also how therelationship between chords and melodywork so the more you study these kind offundamental ideas the better you'regonna get you can see all this stuffhappening excuse me in any genre ofmusic it's all there it all just dependson what tempo and the kind of rhythmthat it goes with so with that beingsaid let's get to the first idea todaywe're going to be playing just with theG C major and D chord probably the mostpopular court set of all time everycampfire songs pretty much using thesechords I'm going to show you you can dothis with any chords but I'm going toshow you how to do it with these chordsso the first thing you're going to do isstart to throw in a alternating fifthbass line well what do I mean by thatwell the example is if you're justplaying this stuff and let's say you'replaying with another personand you just want to enhance you are", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.313}, {"text": "playing to give some sort of rhythmicdimension well the first thing you'regonna do is start to understand what doI mean excuse me what do I mean by fivewell it's the fifth note of the court orthe interval five so in the key of Gsoror G chordthose notes are made up of G B and D andit's that D that's the fifth so you wantto pluck the g string and the core andthen the D string this is going to giveyou this kind of like trotting type ofbass lines so you're gonna go from thisto this[Music]and so on and so on and so you'reprobably like oh my god I know this wellin case you don't you want to practicethis but keep watching this video we'regonna layer three easy concepts so letme show you about that C chord now the Cchord is interesting because you'replaying a C here and if you happen tolike one of my favorite guitar playersJerry Garcia you're gonna see him doingthis all the time which is play a Cchord here the notes are up on thescreen C E and G with a G on that thirdfret of the E string is our fifth and soyou can pluck this note here strum thechord and then just move that ringfingernow we're playing this with with otherguitar player it's gonna sound great andso doing this by yourself makes ittotally sound kind of like very you knowhorse trot a cowboy chords type stylebut when you're playing with anotherplayer it's kind of kind of like beingthe mix now the D chord I'm going toshow you this you ever D chord notes ofa deep-water dean f-sharp and a and takea look at a sore five and lucky for uswe have an a string right above the Dstring and so we can alternate[Music]now the idea behind this is that thefifths of all these chords are pureharmony notes they don't really dictatethe sound of the chord and what I meanby that is you're not playing the major", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "third the minor third which is the realsound that chord you're playing a aharmony and you find this in a lot ofgenres and just in case you're wonderingabout the rhythm you go to what you wantto practice one and[Music]so you're plucking on the ones and twosone[Music]and you're also plucked number three'sin the forest so so listen I'm gonnaplay quick like Ted with 12 bar bluescampfire thing but with alternating basslines or the fifth base line here we go[Music][Music]I know that was quite long but I justwant to show you that when you canreally concentrate on hitting those basslines while the song starts to developits own rhythm and it sounds a littlebetter than just better excuse me thanjust playing this and so that's levelone the alternating the fifth note ofthe fifth interval bassline now how dowe get better well this one I'm gonnadrop on you is is probably like a la diathe most important piece of how musicworks which is you can now introduce thepentatonic of the chord you are on", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "alright now for the people-watch stitchmethod more of the advanced lessons Imean this is the secrets of like most ofour favorite guitar players and so youcan do it in the simple method to getused to the idea so let me show you whenyou're in the G chord now to achievemajor pentatonic and that is as simpleas zero three zero two zero two zero twozero three zero three so now let me showyou but I'm going to show you in a coolway I'm gonna practice with myalternating bass line that I just didand then introducing the pentatonic likethis[Music]there it is there there was the fiftypurple bass line with the pentatonic andthe rhythm I was doing was one and thenpentatonic one E and a two E and[Music]okay I'll go I'll do the C right now sofor the C major and keep thosealternating bass lines going and now I'mgoing to introduce the C majorpentatonic and it's going to be zerothree zero three zero two zero two onethree zero three just in case you haveany questions about how do I find thosePentatonix I'll be linking a video rightabout here someplace and also in thecomment section and in the videodescription of how to find anypentatonic you want at any time alrightand so we have our C chord on so I havea C major pentatonic I'm going to do theC chord for a little bit with thealternating bass line and the pentatoniclet's see what sounds like[Music]cool ooh sorry it just startedthundering and lightning about to the D", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "chord here we go this took for the Dchord we have a bass line and indeedmajor pentatonic in open position isquite weird because the guitar ends herewhich I'll do another video for guitarvent fundamentals on but long storyshort is zero two zero two zero two fourzero three zero two[Music]all right so now let's see if I can dothe same thing and introducing some Dpentatonix[Music]so there it is again now I'm puttingcore tones on top my alternating fifthbaseline all right let's see if we trythis all together again we're just kindof the layering approach all right andso I'm gonna play a shorter 12 bar bluesnot as long it's got nothing to reallybe a 12 who's but a shorter version ofthis let's see if we can hear thosesounds[Music]all right not bad all right so you'vehopefully heard playing thosealternating bass lines and introducingthose Pentatonix's already starting tosound good the last level of advice thatI will give you now you can't do whatI'm about to do all the time you got touse it like with some taste anddiscretion which is slide the minorthird into the major third of the chordwrong now if you're a longtime fan ofstich method you're already going okay I", "start": 480.0,

chordand this B here is the major third soit's not unheard of to slide into the Bfrom the fret behind which is the minorthird and you probably notice this veryfamous like blues bluegrass tag endinglikethat's where it comes from okay so thisbe here sliding into it from the B haveto be flat isn't huge this kid starts togive you a very intense bluegrass soundso you want to be able to spot where themajor thirds are of this chord againhere's a major third here slide into itnow the B here is the major third butthe problem is you can't slide into itso you can take that third fret slide itto the fourth fret so now listen forstep one the alternating bass line thatI'm doing step two the pentatonic andstep three now introducing the minorthirds into the major thirds[Music]you really start to hear it shine youcan do the same thing for the C chordhere's the C chord that middle fingerboom is that major third want frontbehind it alrightain't nothing wrong[Applause][Music]nothing wrong with in that major thirdin my third now for the D chordinterestingly enough all rightthis guy here that's my major third knowit okay minor third here look at thedifference between a D minor D majorthat's my minor third so let's see if wecan put this all together with all ofour newfound knowledge fifth baselines", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "the pentatonix and the minor major

differentlayers you're gonna be one awesomeguitar player but you want to go slowtry it on acoustic right now because theacoustic rings it's made to soundbeautiful and so what you want topractice again put them the fits in yourbass lines once you're comfortable withthat comfortable sorry I say that worktoo quickly then you can move to puttingthe pentatonic for each chord in andonce you're comfortable with those tostart putting the minor third majorthird slides in and you'll really startto sound good really quickly so thesebasic three steps can be done to anychord in any progression but let's starthere with G C and D for us beginners andintermediate players who just won'tlearn how it's done so have fun withthis if you like this please shareplease subscribe I'll see you guys soonon
