[{"text": " [Music] you [Music] all right before we begin this special episode of stitch method on guitar fundamentals you might be asking yourself why the scarf in and I'll tell you because when you have a giant mosquito button your neck and you go to film a YouTube video you can't help but notice it so my wife did this let you let her know in the comments if you like the scarf with stitch besides that let's get to guitar fundamentals three easy steps for any beginner intermediate guitar player to sound better and better every time the reason I want to present this video is because in case you're camping with your family like I was over the weekend or if you're just playing with people or family comes over and they say hey you play guitar play something these are some things that you can do to enhance your playing right away but not only that it's also how music totally works it's also how the relationship between chords and melody work so the more you study these kind of fundamental ideas the better you're gonna get you can see all this stuff happening excuse me in any genre of music it's all there it all just depends on what tempo and the kind of rhythm that it goes with so with that being said let's get to the first idea today we're going to be playing just with the G C major and D chord probably the most popular court set of all time every campfire songs pretty much using these chords I'm going to show you you can do this with any chords but I'm going to show you how to do it with these chords so the first thing you're going to do is start to throw in a alternating fifth bass line well what do I mean by that well the example is if you're just playing this stuff and let's say you're playing with another person and you just want to enhance you are", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.313}, {"text": " playing to give some sort of rhythmic dimension well the first thing you're gonna do is start to understand what do I mean excuse me what do I mean by five well it's the fifth note of the court or the interval five so in the key of G soror G chord those notes are made up of G B and D and it's that D that's the fifth so you want to pluck the g string and the core and then the D string this is going to give you this kind of like trotting type of bass lines so you're gonna go from this to this [Music] and so on and so on and so you're probably like oh my god I know this well in case you don't you want to practice this but keep watching this video we're gonna layer three easy concepts so let me show you about that C chord now the C chord is interesting because you're playing a C here and if you happen to like one of my favorite guitar players Jerry Garcia you're gonna see him doing this all the time which is play a C chord here the notes are up on the screen C E and G with a G on that third fret of the E string is our fifth and so you can pluck this note here strum the chord and then just move that ring finger now we're playing this with with other guitar player it's gonna sound great and so doing this by yourself makes it totally sound kind of like very you know horse trot a cowboy chords type style but when you're playing with another player it's kind of kind of like being the mix now the D chord I'm going to show you this you ever D chord notes of a deep-water dean f-sharp and a and take a look at a sore five and lucky for us we have an a string right above the D string and so we can alternate [Music] now the idea behind this is that the fifths of all these chords are pure harmony notes they don't really dictate the sound of the chord and what I mean by that is you're not playing the major", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " third the minor third which is the real sound that chord you're playing a a harmony and you find this in a lot of genres and just in case you're wondering about the rhythm you go to what you want to practice one and [Music] so you're plucking on the ones and twos one [Music] and you're also plucked number three's in the forest so so listen I'm gonna play quick like Ted with 12 bar blues campfire thing but with alternating bass lines or the fifth base line here we go [Music] [Music] I know that was quite long but I just want to show you that when you can really concentrate on hitting those bass lines while the song starts to develop its own rhythm and it sounds a little better than just better excuse me than just playing this and so that's level one the alternating the fifth note of the fifth interval bassline now how do we get better well this one I'm gonna drop on you is is probably like a la dia the most important piece of how music works which is you can now introduce the pentatonic of the chord you are on", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " alright now for the people-watch stitch method more of the advanced lessons I mean this is the secrets of like most of our favorite guitar players and so you can do it in the simple method to get used to the idea so let me show you when you're in the G chord now to achieve major pentatonic and that is as simple as zero three zero two zero two zero two zero three zero three so now let me show you but I'm going to show you in a cool way I'm gonna practice with my alternating bass line that I just did and then introducing the pentatonic like this [Music] there it is there there was the fifty purple bass line with the pentatonic and the rhythm I was doing was one and then pentatonic one E and a two E and [Music] okay I'll go I'll do the C right now so for the C major and keep those alternating bass lines going and now I'm going to introduce the C major pentatonic and it's going to be zero three zero three zero two zero two one three zero three just in case you have any questions about how do I find those Pentatonix I'll be linking a video right about here someplace and also in the comment section and in the video description of how to find any pentatonic you want at any time alright and so we have our C chord on so I have a C major pentatonic I'm going to do the C chord for a little bit with the alternating bass line and the pentatonic let's see what sounds like [Music] cool ooh sorry it just started thundering and lightning about to the D", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " chord here we go this took for the D chord we have a bass line and indeed major pentatonic in open position is quite weird because the guitar ends here which I'll do another video for guitar vent fundamentals on but long story short is zero two zero two zero two four zero three zero two [Music] all right so now let's see if I can do the same thing and introducing some D pentatonix [Music] so there it is again now I'm putting core tones on top my alternating fifth baseline all right let's see if we try this all together again we're just kind of the layering approach all right and so I'm gonna play a shorter 12 bar blues not as long it's got nothing to really be a 12 who's but a shorter version of this let's see if we can hear those sounds [Music] all right not bad all right so you've hopefully heard playing those alternating bass lines and introducing those Pentatonix's already starting to sound good the last level of advice that I will give you now you can't do what I'm about to do all the time you got to use it like with some taste and discretion which is slide the minor third into the major third of the chord wrong now if you're a longtime fan of stich method you're already going okay I", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " got this if you haven't seen this before this move is probably another quintessential move into guitar solos and melodies so you want to get used to the idea so let's see it in a G chord and this B here is the major third so it's not unheard of to slide into the B from the fret behind which is the minor third and you probably notice this very famous like blues bluegrass tag ending like that's where it comes from okay so this be here sliding into it from the B have to be flat isn't huge this kid starts to give you a very intense bluegrass sound so you want to be able to spot where the major thirds are of this chord again here's a major third here slide into it now the B here is the major third but the problem is you can't slide into it so you can take that third fret slide it to the fourth fret so now listen for step one the alternating bass line that I'm doing step two the pentatonic and step three now introducing the minor thirds into the major thirds [Music] you really start to hear it shine you can do the same thing for the C chord here's the C chord that middle finger boom is that major third want front behind it alright ain't nothing wrong [Applause] [Music] nothing wrong with in that major third in my third now for the D chord interestingly enough all right this guy here that's my major third know it okay minor third here look at the difference between a D minor D major that's my minor third so let's see if we can put this all together with all of our newfound knowledge fifth baselines", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " the pentatonix and the minor major third moves [Music] all right so what have we done today hopefully it's a simple idea you definitely practice this stuff I'm not lying to you when I say if you can think about all these things in different layers you're gonna be one awesome guitar player but you want to go slow try it on acoustic right now because the acoustic rings it's made to sound beautiful and so what you want to practice again put them the fits in your bass lines once you're comfortable with that comfortable sorry I say that work too quickly then you can move to putting the pentatonic for each chord in and once you're comfortable with those to start putting the minor third major third slides in and you'll really start to sound good really quickly so these basic three steps can be done to any chord in any progression but let's start here with G C and D for us beginners and intermediate players who just won't learn how it's done so have fun with this if you like this please share please subscribe I'll see you guys soon on another episode of guitar fundamentals with stitch", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}]
