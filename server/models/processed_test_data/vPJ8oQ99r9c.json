the Real Estate\nIncome Fund at Fidelity.And you might say,\nwell, why doeshe want to come to a\nBlockchain and Money course?It's because we went to\nhigh school together.[LAUGHTER]So-- and I was at

shamelessly for\nMIT and MIT students.So let's get going.I was letting a little bit\nof time for a few more peopleto wander in.Today, we're going to talk--of course, we're going to chat\na little bit

for\nall of our lectures,but it's particularly\nrelevant today,because we're going to\nbe talking about twodifferent database structures.One's the permissionless\nblockchain of Bitcoin.But now, today, we're going\nto introduce and go deeperinto the permissioned, or\nprivate, set of blockchains,like the IBM\nHyperledger and Corda.But the technical issues\nrelate to all of that.And then, of course,\nwe're going to talkabout that against a\nthird type of database--traditional databases.So aligning permissionless,\nlike Bitcoin, permissioned--IBM Hyperledger type of--and then traditional databases,\nand why, in a business setting,you might think of one versus\nanother versus another.And I'm sure if I run\noff the rails anywhereon traditional databases, which\nI have not personally

scientistsfrom other parts of MIT, so\nhe helps me out in subjectsI don't know, and even in\nsubjects I think I know.So let's just start a\nlittle bit with what did youtake from the readings?There were four or five\nreadings, of course.But what is a permissioned or\nprivate distributed ledger?Now, I can do this.I can light them up, as some\npeople said, because Toledo'sgiven me my list.But again, class participation--\nanybody who hasn't spoken yetmight want to sort of chime\nin and give it a shot.I'm not seeing any volunteers.If I can-- ooh, yes.Do you want to tell me\nyour first name

stakeholders.And since they are\nthe only ones involvedin verifying the transaction--unlike the permissionless\nones, whereit has to be verified\nat all the nodes,this limits the\npermissions required[INAUDIBLE] stakeholders,\nwhich increases,also, the transaction speed.So it's like the\ntriangular dilemmawe learned about, about the\nsecurity and decentralizationand scalability.So it moves away\nfrom decentralizationand towards scalability.PROFESSOR: OK.So Jayeta--AUDIENCE: Jayehta.PROFESSOR: Jayeta went\nthrough a whole lot.It's about the number of\nnodes and permissionedinto it, and that\nit addresses someof that Buterin's trilemma.So at its core, it\nsort of addressessome of the scalability issues.But it does that at a trade\noff that it's not truly open.It's not, anyone

Brotish, I will try\nto research the Cordathing more specifically.Other thoughts?So then you create an auditable\ndatabase-- some databasewith cryptography.Hash functions, which half\nthe class said they understoodand the other half\nwas sort of, youknow, a little rough on, all\nis in permissioned systems,using cryptographic\nschemes to ensurefor the validity of the\ndata and, so to speak,the immutable\nnature of the data.What's different is\nconsensus protocols.In essence, it all goes down,\nexcept for Brotish's point,maybe, about Corda, as\nto who gets the chanceto add the additional

mentioned that\nbecause of the worldvalue of the digital currency\nis very minimal compared to,let's say, [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: The value\nof crypto financeis about $220 billion right now,\ncompared to worldwide capitalmarkets that, in aggregate,\nare over $300 trillionof debt, bonds, and equities.AUDIENCE: So my question was\nmore like [INAUDIBLE] opinionon this, that this value is

worldwide\nfinancial assets,couldn't it still be relevant\nto financial stability?And the answer is yes.But it's still relatively-- it's\nless than one one-thousandthsof the broad size.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Yes, please.Better you than me.AUDIENCE: So basically,\nwe did an analysis betweenthe correlation [INAUDIBLE]\npublic market [INAUDIBLE]and basically there's a\ncorrelation of roughly 80%to 85% when the public--when the Bitcoin market's\ndown, within the past year,the public market's\nlikely to lift up.Because there's a lot of\nleverage built into the system.", "start":

'08 crisis,two issues of trust-- one where\nthere was a counterparty trustissue.Even though the overall\nderivatives marketwas [INAUDIBLE],, banks\ndidn't individuallyknow which other bank\nwas most at risk.And so they wouldn't\ntrade with each otheror lend to one another.And then on the opposite\nside, the solution--the salvation-- was two\npeople in a room trustingeach other that the central\nbank-- that the governmentwould fund tens of billions of\ndollars [INAUDIBLE] capital.And so I wonder your\nthoughts on blockchain's rolein addressing that\nfirst problem of knowingyour counterparty,\nor at least beingable to trust their\nposition, and then the riskof eliminating the second\nchance of injection of capitalinto the financial\nsystem in a blockchain.PROFESSOR: Russ, [INAUDIBLE].AUDIENCE: I had a question.It's related to this--PROFESSOR: All right.AUDIENCE: --which is--PROFESSOR: Thanks, Brotish.[INAUDIBLE]AUDIENCE: But the\nquestion is this.It does strike me that you\nonly have a financial stabilityproblem if people are relying\non the value of people'sBitcoin holdings, for example,\nwhich is the bulk of cryptoassets, right?The reason you have the\nproblem during the crisisis you have all these banks.They're carrying these assets\non their balance sheet.And all of the\nsudden, people thinkthey don't know what\nthey're worth, right?Who, if anyone, is actually\ncarrying a Bitcoin assetson a balance sheet that\nsomeone else is relying on?Or, to put it differently,\nwho's extending the leverage?PROFESSOR: All right.So let me--AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Let me\nwrap these together.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "I think that what many central\nbankers and the FinancialStability Board would\nsay, at 200 billionversus 300 trillion, it's\nprobably not that financiallyrelevant at this point.Where it could get relevant is,\nas Russ has sort of suggested,is if there's\nleverage behind it.If it's in a balance sheet, it's\nan asset on a balance sheet,and there's a liability\non the other side.And thus it could\nbring down that entity,whether it's a hedge\nfund, whether it's a bank.But something that's relying\n[INAUDIBLE] to tie itback to the questions\nthat Tom raisedis, could blockchain\nlower systemic risk?Possibly, if it's a\nbetter database solution.If it answers-- what Mervyn\nKing was speaking about,we also addressed\nin the late 90s.I remember quite well\nwhen Secretary Rubincalled a number of us\ninto his office and said,I don't understand.The banks can't tell us\ntheir exposure to Korea.A number of countries--South Korea was about\nto have-- but theydidn't default on\ntheir debt, but theywere coming close to\ndefaulting on their debt.And of course, it was\nonly a short whilebefore other countries,\nlike Indonesia and Thailand,were getting into that\nsame debt challenge.But why couldn't banks tell\nthe US Department of Treasurytheir exposure?It's usually\nthrough derivatives.And derivatives,\nboth in the late '90sand the financial\ncrisis, were oftensomething that propagated\nrisk through the system.Now, the numbers were larger--I mean, depending upon the time.The '90s was less than this.But it was $300, $400\ntrillion of notional amountof derivatives.So just the sheer\nnotional size, even", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "though the capital at\nrisk in derivativeswas much smaller\nbecause the leverageof this notional--\nbig, notional size.And the transparency\nwas pretty low.It wasn't zero, actually.It wasn't zero.But it was really low.And so I think that's\nwhat Mervyn King wouldhave been mentioning.And I do think blockchain can\nhelp in that transparency.But it takes a big\ncollective action.And so Europe, the US,\nand Asia-- a lot of lawswere passed to get more\ntransparency in the derivativesspace.Brotish, I would say that\nthere could be problems.And I've had conversations\nwith elected leaders thatsay, don't get\nlulled into the sensethat it won't have\nfinancial stability issues.Because that was what\nhappened in the 1980s and '90swhen people said, well,\nderivatives will notcreate instability,\nbecause it's onlythe institutional investors,\nthe sophisticated investors--the so to speak big boys\nor big girls, you know?And I was part of those debates,\nthat consensus that formed thatit was only institutional\nand it wouldn't--but there was a lot of leverage\nand a lack of transparency whenbig leverage--multiple hundreds of\ntrillions of dollars--associated with it, of course,\nwas part of the crisis--not the only part of the crisis.But any other\nquestions before Hugo?AUDIENCE: Yeah.On the protecting the\ninvesting public front,I was just wondering,\nlike, a lot of peopleare now using Robinhood and\nzero fee things like thatto invest in the stock market.And companies like\nRobinhood and Vanguardoften sell order book data\nto high frequency tradersso that they can kind\nof know what's going onand maybe front run.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So I was wondering how\nthat fits into whatwe were talking\nabout last time wherethere's no transparency on\nmany of the

also have a\nhuge effect on stock price.And then they can,\nafterwards, dump on people.So how is that different\nfrom what's going onin cryptocurrency exchanges?PROFESSOR: All right.So that's an

client thatmight affect the\nmarket pricing, youmight jump ahead of that\nclient with their information.Their information might be\na buy order, a sell order.Or frankly, it might be\nsome other information.But traditionally, if they have\na buy order or a sell order,you have information.And then you're sort of jumping\nahead and saying, all right.I'll buy or sell\nin front of them.That's the

as they\nare both market makers--meaning they are buying when\nyou're selling and sellingwhen you're buying.That's the nature\nof a market maker.It's very typical, very\nlegal, very importantfunction of market.But the exchanges are\nboth market makers,and then they show order books.And so it sort of helps\nthem do front running.Not that a lot of people\nnecessarily agree with me,I think these markets\nwould be better offif there were some forms of\nrules about front runningand manipulation in\nmarkets and the like.On your 5% question,\ncan we take it upin office hours or something?Because

permissioned,\nlike Fabric, or permissionless,can--if it was efficient\nand scalable--could help out, because you\ncould actually timestampwhen did the order come in.When did the\nclient's

blockchain.But if you look at both the\nalgorithms and the data flows,they have very\ngood timestamping.I'm not going to\nsay it's perfect,but they have very\ngood timestampingto ensure when are orders--basically message timestamping\nevery message that comes in.And some order books, like\nthe New York Stock Exchange--some order books are\nprice and time priority,price priority meaning high bid\ngets hit before the next bid,or lowest offer\ngets lifted first.That's price priority.But they might also\nhave time priorityfor any bid that has the same\nprice and any offer that'sthe same

understandingwhy that needs to\nbe on a blockchain,whether permissioned\nor nonpermissioned,and why that needs to be.PROFESSOR: So the question\nis, why is Walmartputting supply chain with a\nbunch of agricultural productson a blockchain?Agricultural products\nare something of value,whether it's corn,\nwheat, grapes.It's something of value.And when it moves from one\nowner to another owner,if you keep that\non a ledger, youcan record that\nAmanda has the grapes,and Gary no longer\nhas the grapes.And another thing that\nblockchains help withis they lower the cost of\nreconciling multiple databases.We could keep-- as\nin agriculture--we can keep separate\nledgers, separate databases.The farmers keeping\ntheir database.The wholesaler with\nthe grain elevatorsare keeping their

multiple\nledgers and things of value,blockchain, I think,\nis more valuable.Zan's asking, well,\nis that Walmart?I don't know.We're going to find out.Tom, and I've got about\nseven minutes to

somebody comes in to you\nwith a blockchain solution,this is the same thing.Hopefully, you'll\nmake it better.This is just my approach to it.Public blockchain-- do\nyou need, basically,public write capability,\nthat lots of peoplecan write to these ledgers?Do you need that somewhere?Secondly, do you want some peer\nto peer transaction capabilityacross the distributed ledger?Do you kind of not want\nany central intermediary?Maybe you don't want\nthe central intermediarybecause they're\nslow and sluggish.Maybe you don't want\nthe central intermediarybecause they have a\nlot of economic rents.It doesn't matter to me\nwhy you want to get ridof the central intermediary.But if you want to get rid\nof a central intermediary,or lessen their control,\nor lower their control,raise peer to peer transactions,\nhave a lot of public writing--oh, and by the way, if you\nwant some token economics,you're probably\nsomewhere over here.I'm not saying you\nhave to have all four.But to me, those are\nthe kind of threeor four things that\nare floating aroundwhy you might be over there.Private blockchains--\nwell, maybe you actuallydon't want public\nwrite capability.You need private.Whether it's just the Australian\nStock Exchange or 15 to 20 clubdeal, you still want kind\nof multiple people to write,but you want it to be private.But if you still need finality\nof data and an append-only

final\nsettlement and immutability.And immutability\nappend-only logs give yousome of that final settlement.We talked very briefly\nabout a lawsuitthat was 300 plus years ago--\nthe Crawford case in
