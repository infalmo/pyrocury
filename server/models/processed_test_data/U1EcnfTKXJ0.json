simple.It is everything.\nI mean, everything we have seenso far is on the exam.\nBut let me just remind you ofthe main topics that we have\nseen.First of all,\nwe learned about vectors,how to use them,\nand dot-product.At this point,\nyou probably should know thatthe dot-product of two vectors\nis obtained by summing productsof components.\nAnd geometrically it is thelength of A times the length of\nB times the cosine of the anglebetween them.\nAnd, in particular,we can use dot-product to\nmeasure angles by solving forcosine theta in this equality.\nAnd most importantly to detectwhether two vectors are\nperpendicular to each other.Two vectors are perpendicular\nwhen their dot-product is zero.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Any questions about that?\nNo.Is everyone reasonably happy\nwith dot-product by now?I see a stunned silence.\nNobody happy with dot-productso far?\nOK.If you want to look at Practice\n1A, a good example of a typicalproblem with dot-product would\nbe problem 1.Let's see.\nWe are going to go over thepractice exam when I am done\nwriting this list of topics.I think probably we actually\nwill skip this problem because Ithink most of you know how to do\nit.And if not then you should run\nfor help from me or from yourrecitation instructor to figure\nout how to do it.The second topic that we saw\nwas cross-product.When you have two vectors in\nspace, you can just form thatcross-product by computing its\ndeterminant.So, implicitly,\nwe should also know aboutdeterminants.\nBy that I mean two by two andthree by three.\nDon't worry about larger ones,even if you are interested,\nthey won't be on the test.And applications of\ncross-product,for example,\nfinding the area of a triangleor a parallelogram in space.\nIf you have a triangle in space", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.197}, {"text": "with sides A and B then its area\nis one-half of the length of Across B.\nBecause the length of A cross Bis length A, length B sine\ntheta, which is the same as thearea of the parallelogram formed\nby these two vectors.And the other application of\ncross-product is to find avector that's perpendicular to\ntwo given vectors.In particular,\nto find the vector that isnormal to a plane and then find\nthe equation of a plane.Another application is finding\nthe normal vector to a plane andusing that finding the equation\nof a plane.Basically, remember,\nto find the equation of aplane, ax by cz = d,\nwhat you need is the normalvector to the plane.\nAnd the components of thenormal vector are exactly the\ncoefficients that go into this.And we have seen an argument\nfor why that happens to be thecase.\nTo find a normal vector to aplane typically what we will do\nis take two vectors that lie inthe plane and will take their\ncross-product.And the cross-product will\nautomatically be perpendicularto both of them.\nWe are going to see an exampleof that when we look at problem\n5 in practice 1A.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.12}, {"text": "I think we will try to do that\none.Another application,\nwell, we will just mention itas a topic that goes along with\nthis one.We have seen also about\nequations of lines and how tofind where a line intersects a\nplane.Just to refresh your memories,\nthe equation of a line,well, we will be looking at\nparametric equations.To know the parametric equation\nof a line, we need to know apoint on the line and we need to\nknow a vector that is parallelto the line.\nAnd, if we know a point on theline and a vector along the\nline,then we can express the\nparametric equations for themotion of a point that is moving\non the line.Actually, starting at point,\nat time zero,and moving with velocity v.To put things in symbolic form,\nyou will get a position of thatpoint by starting with a\nposition of time zero and addingt times the vector v.\nIt gives you x,y and z in terms of t.\nAnd that is how we represent", "start": 360.0,

question.\nNo, not on the exam.[APPLAUSE]\nTaylor series are something youshould be aware of,\ngenerally speaking.It will be useful for you in\nreal life,probably not when you go to the\nsupermarket,but if you solve engineering\nproblems you will need Taylorseries.\nIt would be good not to forgetthem entirely,\nbut on the 18.02 exams theyprobably won't be there.\nLet me continue with moretopics.\nAnd then we can see if you canthink of other topics that\nshould or should not be on theexam.\nThird topics would be matrices,linear systems,\ninverting matrices.I know that most of you that\nhave calculators that can invertmatrices, but still you are\nexpected at this point to knowhow to do it by hand.\nIf you have looked at thepractice tests,\nboth of them have a problemthat asks you to invert a matrix\nor at least do part of it.And so it is very likely that\ntomorrow there will be a problemlike that as well.\nIn general, when a kind ofproblem is on both practice\ntests it's a good indication", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.179}, {"text": "that it might be there also on\nthe actual exam.Unfortunately,\nnot with the same matrix so youcannot learn the answer by\nheart.Another thing that we have\nlearned about,well, I should say this is\ngoing to be problem 3 on thetest and will on the practice\ntest.On the actual test,\ntoo, I think,actually.\nAnyway, we will come back to itlater.\nA couple of things that youshould remember.\nIf you have a system of theform AX equals B then there are\ntwo cases.If a determinant of A is not\nzero then that means you cancompute the inverse matrix and\nyou can just solve by taking Ainverse times B.\nAnd the other case is when thedeterminant of A is zero,\nand there is either no solutionor there is infinitely many\nsolutions.In particular,\nif you know that there is asolution,\nfor example,if B is zero there always is an\nobvious solution,X equals zero,\nthen you will actually haveinfinitely many.\nIn general, we don't reallyknow how to tell whether it is\nno solution or infinitely many.Questions about that?\nYes?Will we have to know how to\nrotate vectors and so on?Not in general,\nbut you might still want to", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "remember how to rotate a vector\nin a plane by 90 degrees becausethat has been useful when we\nhave done problems aboutparametric

of yourhomework.\nIt is a good idea to have somevague knowledge because it is\nuseful culture,I would say,\nuseful background for later inyour lives,\nbut I won't ask you by heart toknow what is the formation for a\nrotation matrix.And then we come to,\nlast by not least,the problem of finding\nparametric equations.And, in particular,\npossibly by decomposing theposition vector into a sum of\nsimpler vectors.You have seen quite an evil\nexam of that on the last problemset with this picture that maybe\nby now you have had somenightmares about.\nAnyway, the one on the examwill certainly be easier than\nthat.But, as you have seen -- I\nmean, you should know,basically,\nhow to analyze a motion that isbeing described to you and\nexpress it in terms of vectorsand then figure out what the\nparametric equation will be.Now, again, it won't be as\ncomplicated on the exam as theone in the problem set.\nBut there are a couple of thoseon the practice exam,\nso that gives you an idea of",

afunction of a parameter maybe of\ntime,then we have seen also about\nvelocity and acceleration,which the vector is obtained by\ntaking the first and secondderivatives of a position\nvector.And so one topic that I will\nadd in there as well is somehowhow to prove things about\nmotions by differentiatingvector identities.\nOne example of that,for example,\nis when we try to look atKepler's law in class last time.\nWe look at Kepler's second lawof planetary motion,\nand we reduced it to acalculation about a derivative\nof the cross-product R cross v.Now, on the exam you don't need\nto know the details of Kepler'slaw,\nbut you need to be able tomanipulate vector quantities a\nbit in the way that we did.And so on practice exam 1A,\nyou actually have a variety ofproblems on this topics

OK.\nProblem 6 is one of these likevector calculations.\nIt says we have a positionvector R.\nAnd it asks you how do we findthe derivative of R dot R?\nWell, remember we have aproduct rule for taking the\nderivative.UV prime is U prime V plus UV\nprime.It also applies for dot-product.\nThat is dR by dt dot R plus Rdot dR by dt.\nAnd these are both the samething.\nYou get two R dot dR/dt,but dR/dt is v for velocity\nvector.Hopefully you have seen things\nlike that.", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.182}, {"text": "Now, it says show that if R has\nconstant length then they areperpendicular.\nAll you need to write basicallyis we assume length R is\nconstant.That is what it says,\nR has constant length.Well, how do we get to,\nsay, something we probably wantto reduce to that?\nWell, if R is constant inlength then R dot R is also\nconstant.And so that means d by dt of R\ndot R is zero.That is what it means to be\nconstant.And so that means R dot v is\nzero.That means R is perpendicular\nto v.That is a proof.\nIt is not a scary proof.And then the last question of\nthe exam says let's continue toassume that R has constant\nlength, and let's try to find Rdot v.\nIf there is acceleration thenprobably we should bring it in\nsomewhere, maybe by taking aderivative of something.\nIf we know that R dot v equalszero, let's take the derivative\nof that.That is still zero.\nBut now, using the productrule, dR/dt is v dot v plus R\ndot dv/dt is going to be zero.That means that you are asked\nabout R dot A.Well, that is equal to minus V\ndot V.And that is it.", "start": 2880.0, "heat": 0.125}]
