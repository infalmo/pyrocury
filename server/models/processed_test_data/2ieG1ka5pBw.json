[{"text": "JOEL LEWIS: Hi.Welcome back to recitation.In lecture, you've been\nlearning about Stokes' Theorem.And I have a nice\nquestion here for youthat can put Stokes'\nTheorem to the test.So what I'd like\nyou to do is I'dlike you to consider\nthis field F.So its components\nare 2z, x, and y.And the surface S that is the\ntop half of the unit sphere.So it's the sphere\nof radius 1 centeredat the origin, but\nonly its top half.Only the part where z is\ngreater than or equal to 0.So what I'd like you to do\nis to verify Stokes' Theoremfor this surface.So that is, I'd\nlike you to computethe surface integral\nthat comes from Stokes'Theorem for this surface,\nand the line integral thatcomes from Stokes'\nTheorem for the surface,and check that they're\nreally equal to each other.Now, before we\nstart, we should justsay one brief thing about\ncompatible orientation.So I didn't give you\nany orientations,but of course, it doesn't\nmatter as long as youchoose ones that are compatible.So if you think about your rules\nthat you have for finding them.So if you imagine yourself\nwalking along this boundarycircle with your left\nhand out over that sphere.So you'll be walking in this\ncounterclockwise directionwhen your head is sticking\nout of the sphere.All right?So in other words, the outward\norientation on the sphereis compatible with the\ncounterclockwise orientationon the circle that\nis the boundary.So let's actually put\nin a little arrow hereto just indicate that is our\norientation for the circle.And our normal is an\noutward-pointing normal.And let's call our\ncircle C, and our Sis our sphere is our surface.OK.So just so we have\nthe same notation.Good.So why don't you work this\nout, compute the line integral,compute the surface\nintegral, come back,and we can work\nthem out together.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Hopefully you had some luck\nworking on this problem.We have two things to compute.I think I'm going to start\nwith the line integral.So let me write that\ndown: line integral.So what I need to do\nto compute the lineintegral is I need to compute\nthe integral over the curveC of F dot dr. And so I know\nwhat F is on that circle.So I need to know what dr is.So I need to know what r is.I need a parametrization\nof that circle.Well, you know, that is a pretty\neasy circle to parametrize.It's the unit circle\nin the xy-plane.So we have-- for C, we have--\nand we're wandering around itcounterclockwise.So it's our usual\nparametrization.It's the one we like.So we have x equals cosine\nt, y equals sine t--where t goes from 0 to\n2*pi-- and this is in threedimensions, so the other part of\nthe parametrization is z equals0.So this is my parametrization\nof this circle.OK, so let's go ahead\nand put that in.So the integral over C of F\ndot dr is the integral from 0to 2 pi.So we've got three parts.So the first part--\nso F is 2z, x, y.So it's 2z*dx plus\nx*dy plus y*dz.But z is 0 on this whole circle.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So that piece just dies.And dz is also 0, so\nthat piece just dies.So we're just left with x*dy.So this is equal to\nthe integral x dy.Oh.So I guess this is\nnot from 0 to 2*pi.This is still over\nC. Sorry about that.OK.And now I change to\nmy parametrization.OK.Yes.Right.So this is still in dx, dy,\ndz form, so it's still over C.Now we switch to the dt form, so\nnow t is going from 0 to 2*pi.OK, so now we have x*dy.So x is cosine t, and\ndy-- so y is sine t,so dy is cosine t dt.So this is cosine t times\ncosine t, is cosine squared t.dt, gosh.So now you have to\nremember way back in 18.01when you learned how to compute\ntrig integrals like this.So I think the thing\nthat we do, whenwe have a cosine squared t, is\nwe use a half-angle formula.So let me come back down\nhere just to finish this offin one board.OK, so cosine squared t is\nthe integral from 0 to 2*pi.So cosine squared t is 1\nplus cosine 2t over 2, dt.And now cosine 2t, as t goes\nbetween 0 and 2*pi, well,that's two whole loops of it.Right?Two whole periods of cosine 2t.And it's a trig function.It's a nice cosine function.So the positive parts and\nthe negative parts cancel.The cosine 2t part, when we\nintegrate it from 0 to 2*pi,that gives us 0.So we're left with 1/2\nintegrated from 0 to 2*pi,and that's just going to give\nus 1/2 of 2*pi, so that's pi.All right.So good.So that was the line integral.A very straightforward thing.We had our circle back here.We had our field.So we parametrized\nthe curve that", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "is the circle, that\nis the boundary.And then we just computed\nthe line integral,and it was a nice,\neasy one to do.You had to remember one\nlittle trig identity in orderto do it.All right.That's the first one.So let's go on to\nthe surface integral.So the surface\nintegral that you haveto compute in Stokes'\nTheorem is youhave to compute\nthe double integralover your surface of the\ncurl of F dot n with respectto surface area.So this is the integral\nwe want to compute here.So OK.So the first thing\nwe're going to needis we're going to need\nto find the curl of F.So F-- let me just write it\nhere so we don't have to walkall the way back over there.So F is [2z, x, y].So curl of F-- OK, you should\nhave lots of experiencecomputing curls by\nnow-- So it's goingto be this-- I\nalways think of it,so you've got these\nlittle 2 by 2 determinantswith the partial derivatives\nin them, but most of thoseare going to be 0.We've got a d_x x term\nthat's coming up in k,and a d_y y term\nthat's coming up in i,and a d_z 2z term\nthat's coming up in j.So OK.So almost half the terms are 0.The others are really\neasy to compute.I trust that you can\nalso compute and getthat the curl is [1, 2, 1] here.OK, so this is F. This\nis curl of F. Great.So OK.So that's curl of F.So now we need n.Well, let's think.So we need the unit\nnormal to our surface.So back at the beginning\nbefore we started,we said it was the\noutward-pointing normal.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So we need the\noutward-pointing normal.Well, this is a sphere, right?So the normal is parallel\nto the position vector.So that means n\nshould be parallelto the vector [x, y, z].So n should be parallel\nto this vector [x, y, z],but in fact, we're\neven better than that.We're on a unit sphere.So the position vector\nhas length of 1.So n should be pointing in the\nsame direction as this vector,and they both have length\n1, so they had betterbe equal to each other.Great.So this unit normal n is\njust this very simple vector,[x, y, z].If it had been a\nbigger sphere, then youwould have to divide\nthis by the radiusto scale it appropriately.All right.So we've got curl\nF. We've got n.So the integral that we\nwant is this double integralover the surface\nof curl F dot n.So that's x plus 2y plus z,\nwith respect to surface area.OK.Well, now we've just\ngot a surface integral.It's over a hemisphere.Not a terrible thing\nto parametrize.So that's what we should do.We should go in, we\nshould parametrize it,and then we should just compute\nit like a surface integral,like we know how to do.So before we start\nthough, I wantto make one little observation.Well, maybe two\nlittle observations.We can simplify this.All right?x.We're integrating x over\nthe surface of a hemispherecentered at the origin.This hemisphere is\nreally symmetric.And on the back\nside-- the part wherex is negative-- we're getting\nnegative contributions from x.And on the front\nside-- where x ispositive-- we're getting\npositive contributions from x.And because this sphere\nis totally symmetric,", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "those just cancel\nout completely.So when we integrate x\nover the whole hemisphere,it just kills itself.I mean, the negative parts\nkill the positive parts.We just get 0.Similarly, this hemisphere is\nsymmetric between its left sideand its right side, and so\nthe parts where y are negativecancel out exactly the\nparts where y are positive.So as a simplifying\nstep, we can realize,right at the beginning,\nthat this is actuallyjust the integral over S of z\nwith respect to surface area.Now, if you didn't\nrealize that, that's OK.What you would have\ndone is you wouldhave done the parametrization\nthat we're about to do.And in doing that\nparametrization,you would have found that you\nwere integrating something likecosine theta between 0 and\n2*pi, or something like this.And that would have given you 0.So you would have\nfound this symmetry,even if you didn't\nrealize it right now,you would have found it in\nthe process of computingthis integral, but it's\na little bit easier on usif we can recognize\nthat symmetry first.Now, notice that z doesn't\ncancel, because this is justthe top hemisphere, so it\ndoesn't have a bottom halfto cancel out with.Right?So the z part we can't\nuse this easy analysis on.If we integrated this z\nover the whole sphere--if we had the other half\nof the sphere-- well,then that would also give us 0.But we only have the\ntop half of the sphere.So it's going to give us\nsomething positive, because zis always positive up there.OK, so let's actually set\nabout parametrizing it.We want to parametrize\nthe unit sphere.Well, OK.So we have our standard\nparametrizationthat comes from\nspherical coordinates.So rho is just 1.Right?So x is equal to, it's\ngoing to be cosine--You know what?I always get a little\nconfused, so I'm justgoing to check, carefully, that\nI'm doing this perfectly right.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "x is going to be\ncosine theta sine phi.Good.y is going to be\nsine theta sine phi.And z is going to be cosine phi.So that's our parametrization.But we need bounds, of\ncourse, on theta and phiin order to properly describe\njust this hemisphere.So let's think.So for phi, we\nwant the hemispherethat goes from the z-axis\ndown to the xy-plane.So that means we\nwant 0 to be lessthan or equal to phi to be less\nthan or equal to pi over 2.Right?That will give us\njust that top half.And we want the whole thing.We want to go all\nthe way around.So we want 0 less than or equal\nto theta less than or equalto 2*pi.OK, so this is what\nx, y, and z are.These are the bounds for our\nparameters phi and theta.Now, the only\nother thing we needis we need to know what dS is.So in spherical\ncoordinates, we knowthat dS-- I'll put it\nright above here-- so dSis equal to sine\nphi d phi d theta.Let me again just double-check\nthat, that I'm notdoing anything silly.So dS is equal to sine\nphi d phi d theta.So we've got our\nparametrization.We've got our bounds\non our parameters.We know what dS is.And we have the integral\nthat we want to compute.So now we just have to\nsubstitute everythingin and actually compute it\nas an iterated integral.Great.So let's do that.So, this integral\nthat we want, I'mgoing to write a big\nequal sign that'sgoing to carry me\nall the way up here.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "That's an equal sign.All right.So our integral, the\nintegral over S of zwith respect to surface area.So z becomes cosine phi.So we've got our double integral\nbecomes an iterated integral.z becomes cosine phi.dS becomes sine\nphi d phi d theta.And our bounds.So let's see: phi we said is\ngoing from 0 to pi over 2.Zero, pi over 2.And theta is going\nfrom 0 to 2*pi.OK.So now we just have a\nnice, straightforwarditerated integral\nhere to compute.So let's do the inner one first.So we're computing--\nthe inner integralis the integral from 0 to pi\nover 2, of cosine phi sine phid phi.And OK.So there are a bunch\nof different waysyou could do this.If you wanted to get fancy, you\ncould do a double-angle formulahere, but that's really\nmore fancy than you need.Because this is like sine\nphi times d sine phi, right?So this is equal\nto-- another wayof saying that is you can\nmake the substitution u equalssine phi.Anyhow, this is all Calc I\nstuff that hopefully you'repretty familiar with.So OK.So this is equal\nto-- in the end,we get sine squared phi over\n2, between 0 and pi over 2.OK.So we plug this in.So sine squared pi\nover 2, that's 1/2,minus-- sine squared\n0 over 2 is 0 over 2.So it's just 1/2.So the inner integral is 1/2.So let's see about\nthe outer one.The outer integral is just the\nintegral from 0 to 2*pi d theta", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "of whatever the\ninner integral was.Well, the inner\nintegral was 1/2.So the integral from 0\nto 2*pi of 1/2 is pi.Straightforward.Good.So OK.So that's what the\nsurface integral gives us.So let's go back\nhere and compare.So way back at the beginning\nof this recitation,we did the line\nintegral for this circlethat's the boundary of this\nhemisphere, and we got pi.And just now what we did is\nwe had the surface integral--the associated surface integral\nthat we get from Stokes'Theorem, this curl F dot n dS.So we computed F\nand curl F and n.And then we'd noticed a\nlittle nice symmetry here.Although if you\ndidn't notice it,you should have had no trouble\ncomputing the extra termsin the integral that you\nactually ended up with it.It would've been another\ncouple of trig termsthere after you made\nthe substitution.So we parametrized\nour surface nicely.Because it's a sphere,\nit's easy to do.And then we computed\nthe double integraland we also came out with pi.And we better have\nalso come out with pi,because Stokes' Theorem\ntells us that the lineintegral and the\nsurface integralhave to give us the same value.So that's great.So that's exactly what we\nwere hoping would happen.And now we've sort of\nconvinced ourselves, hopefully,that through an\nexample now, we havea feel for what sorts of things\nStokes' Theorem can do for us.I'll end there.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}]
