Uppercase R is\nmeant to convey a one-year spotrate of interest at a\nparticular point in time, t.OK?So capital R1\ndenotes the spot rateof interest between\ntoday and next year.Capital R3 denotes the\nspot rate of interestbetween years 2 and 3.And capital Rt denotes\nthe one year spot ratebetween dates t minus 1 and t.OK?So these capital R's are\nalways one-year rates,unlike the little r's, which\ncan denote multi-year rates,depending on the application.Now, there's a reason I\nwanted to find these big R's.It turns out that if I have\na pure discount bond thatpays off at year t, then I can\nuse the one-year spot ratesto compute today's price.Right?", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "The one-year spot rate,\nwhen you accumulatethat, when you\nmultiply them together,will give you the\naccumulated interestover this entire t-year period.So if I want to\ndiscount face value, F,and bring it back\nto year zero, Ican just assume that\nthere exists one rate.Or I can say, you know what?If there are multiple rates\nthat differ year by year,I can use those\nindividual rates.So I get that first equation.Now, we don't observe them.So this is a pure fiction, in\nterms of what I'm writing down.It's a theory.So I'm not telling you that we\nknow what those big R's are.But I know that they exist,\nand whatever they are,this is what the price of\nthe bond ought to be today.Any questions about that?OK.Now, what I do observe is the\nprice and F. Those things,I get from the marketplace and\nthe contract for these bonds.Therefore, it turns out that\nas a very simple identity,this expression, this little r--which-- I'm adding some\nmore complicated notationto indicate when I begin\nand when I end in termsof my horizon--I can simply define this\nlittle r as being equalto the geometric average\nof these big R's.It's really just\nterminology at this point.Right?I'm simply saying\nthat in reality, wehave one-year interest rates\nthat may change over time.And I know that the\nprice of the bond todayis equal to the future course\nof one-year interest ratesas discounts over that period.When I use those\nas discount rates,I bring back the value F,\nand I get today's price.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "I can just as well write that\nchain of one-year interestrates as a single number,\nraised to the t-th power.I can always do that.You can think of this\nlittle r as an average,a geometric average,\nof the

raise that to the 1over t-th power or\ntake the t-th root,and then subtract 1 from that--\nthat's what my little r is.Now, why am I going\nthrough all of this?It's because I want\nto show you thatfrom a theoretical perspective,\nthe little r, whichwe can observe,\ncontains informationabout the future course\nof interest rates.Within the little r\nare all the big R's--at least today's

now,30 years from now.Now, let me give you an\nexample, just to make surethat we understand the mechanism\nby which these little r'sand big R's are determined.Here's a set of\nprices of strips.These are treasury securities,\nissued by the US government.And then, a third party buys\nthem, takes the coupons,creates separate\nsecurities, and sellsthose separate securities,\neach one of whichis one of these coupons.So from our perspective, they\nlook like pure discount bonds.There's no intermediate\ncoupon paymentsfor each one of these\nstrips, and the maturity", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1},

little bit lessthan the dollar.So how do we figure out what\nthe little r is, associatedwith those various prices?Well, let's take an example.The five-year strip is priced\nat, about, $0.80 to the dollar.OK?So the price is\n0.797, and that'sequal to $1 paid\nfive years later.So therefore, it's $1\ndiscounted back five years.So I'm gonna use my little\nr, and the zero comma fiveindicates that it's today's\nspot rate for borrowingover a five-year horizon.And it turns out that\nwhen I solve for that,I get a number that's 4.64%.That's the rate of return,\nthe cost of capital,the yield of that\nfive period horizon.Any questions about this?Yeah.STUDENT: How do we do it,\nmaybe, if it was one thatwas less than a year's horizon?ANDREW LO: So if it's less\nthan a year's horizon,then you

suppose that we\nobserve a bunch of theseas we do with the strips.So in other words, you've\ngot a five-year rate,you've got a 10-year rate,\nyou've got a two-year rate,and so on.What does that tell\nus about the future?Well, let's write\ndown the big R's.Even though we don't see\nthem, we know that somehow,implicitly, they're there.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.189}, {"text": "So what are the relationships\nbetween the littler's and the big R's?Well, you'll see something\nreally neat emerge out of this.We'll start with\na one-year strip.With a one-year strip,\nthe little r and the big Rare the same, because\nit's only one year.So there's a one-year big\nR, a one-year little r,and when you work\nout the math, they'reactually equal to each other.But now, when you go with\ntwo years, three years, and tyears, it gets a little\nbit more complicated.Take a look at\nwhat happens if youtake the price of the\none-year, and you divide thatinto the price of the two-year.These two securities-- the\none-year and the two-year--they have the same F,\nthe same face value.They pay $1,000 at maturity.But one of them goes for\none year, and one of themgoes for two years.What happens when\nyou take P 0,1,and you divide that by P 0,2?By the way, both of\nthose prices exist today.Right?For example, if you take\na look at the strips,the price of P 0,1 is 0.967.The price of P 0,2 is

don't have a calculator with\nme, but I'm sure all of you do.Somebody do that division\nfor me, will you?Can you take 0.967 and\ndivide that by 0.927?What do you get?0.967 divided by 0.927.What's

that ratesare going to go up, that\nrates have to go up,for one of two reasons.And in fact, you can take a look\nat the steepness of the yieldcurve as telling you what\nthe market's expectations

thatcredit crunch--ANDREW LO: Well, that's right.I think that when you\nthink about the instrumentsthat the Fed has for managing\nmonetary policy, credit,and liquidity, it's\nactually pretty minimal.I mean, they have one variable.You know?Imagine flying a mirror plane\nand you get one control.You pick the control.You want to be able to control\nthe wheels, or the ailerons,or the--?It's very, very hard\nto try to managethe economy with one variable.Now, the Fed has other\npolicy instrumentsthat are a little bit more\ncomplex, like the discountwindow, like moral suasion.The New York Fed can\ngo to these banksand say, what are\nyou guys doing?Are you nuts?But what's going on now is that\nbecause the crisis has reachedsuch an extraordinary\nlevel, they're notworrying about interest rates.They're actually\ntrying to figure outhow to stave off some\nkind of mass panic.And so getting directly\ninvolved with AIG,getting in discussions with\nBear Stearns and JP Morgan--they really have no choice.And it's a signal of, sort\nof, how desperate times are.One last question?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] My\nunderstanding is firstthat the Fed is not a\nfederal organization.It's made up of a\nnumber of banks,so that it's not a\ngovernment entity,", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.486}, {"text": "but the government has\nappointed representatives to it.And at the same time,\nwhere does the Fedget all their money from?ANDREW LO: Well, this\nis more of a questionthat you probably should be\nasking your macro instructor.I'm happy to answer\nit, but the macro folksmay disagree with what\nI'm about to tell you.The Fed is a government\norganization.It's separate from the\ngovernment in the sensethat it's not a\npolitical organization,but it does have the full\nbacking of the government,and it has powers\ngranted to it as partof the various\nlegal proposals thatwere developed to create\nthe Federal Reserve system.Where does the Fed\nget its money from?It gets its money\nfrom the treasury.So the Fed can\nactually engage in whatare called open\nmarket operationsand can actually contract\nor expand money supply,based upon what the\ntreasury will allow it to door will work with it to do.And the Fed controls\nthe borrowing rateamong all of the member\nbanks, and actually, allof the major banks are members.So it's not like you can\nstart up your bank tomorrow.In order to start a bank\nand deal with the public,you need a bank charter,\nand the bank charteris issued by the government.And once you're part\nof that network,you are part of the\nFederal Reserve system.STUDENT: Aren't they\nlosing money from, say,the fallout of\nthese [? banks? ?]Aren't they, in essence,\nlosing also themselves?ANDREW LO: Well, they're\nnot trying to make money.That's not their objective.And if they're losing\nmoney, ultimately, it'snot them that is losing money.It is-- who?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]ANDREW LO: Yeah.We're losing money.It's government-sponsored.So that's one of the\nreasons why, I think,the Fed has been so\nconcerned about bailing outLehman Brothers.And even the bailout of\nBear Stearns, which did notnecessarily cost them anything--the fact that they were willing\nto provide this backstopguarantee in order to\nmake the deal happen--that implicit\ninsurance is a costthat we ultimately\nend up paying.They got a huge amount\nof heat for that,", "start":

little bitlonger, but I do want to cover\nsome additional material.So this is the\nexpression that we justdescribed for getting a sense\nof future interest rates.And we saw, given\ntoday's yield

about\nmulti-year rates.This is a clear example.This is one example.And it turns out that\nthere's another example thatmakes this a little\nbit clearer, which isfuture rates and forward rates.These are all very\nconfusing terminology,unless you sit down and\nread through it carefully,so I would encourage you all\nto do that after this lecture.There's a lot of\nnotation in this lecture,but not a lot of\nconceptual challenges.Because all the\nconceptual challenges,we derived when we talked\nabout net present value rules.So most of this is just lots\nof notation and terminology.So let me describe\nthe terminology here.At date zero, if we focus\non the price of a bond,that matures at time t minus 1.And at date zero, if we focus\non the price of a bond thatmatures at day t, and we\ntake the ratio of those two,then it turns out, we're\ngetting an implicit forecastof the future one-year spot\nrate between t minus 1 and t.Right?That's just what we did with r2.", "start": 2160.0, "heat":

three years from now?Then, what you would do is\nto take a five-year bondand compare that to\na three-year bond,and that would give you the\ntwo-year forward rate today,starting in year 3.OK?Lots of

dealwith these transactions.Now, if there are no more\nquestions about pure discountbonds, I want to turn to the\nmore general case of couponbonds.These are bonds that\npay off coupons.And really, the theory\nbehind coupon bondsis virtually identical to that\nof discount bonds, in the sensethat you can always\nlook at a coupon bondas a package of discount bonds.Right?That's, sort of, the\nopposite of a strip.A strip takes a coupon\nbond and breaks it upinto what look like\nlittle discount bonds.Well, if you think about\nwhat a coupon bond is,it's really just a\ncollection of discount bondsat different maturities.That's the way to\nthink about it.Here's a simple example.A three-year bond\nwith a 5% coupon", "start": 3240.0, "heat": 0.305}, {"text": "is going to look like this.It's going to pay 50,\n50, and then 1,050.Now, as I mentioned, there\nare some coupon bondsthat pay semiannually.So when they say that\nthere's a coupon of 3%,it's 3% every six months.So you have to take\nthat into accountwhen you're computing\nthe present valuesof these objects.How do we do it?Exactly the same way as we\ndo for pure discount bonds.Take the coupons, each of\nthem, and discount them backto the present, using either\nthe big R's or the little r's.Either way, you ought\nto get the same answer,because the little r's are\nsimply the geometric averagesof the big R's.OK?However, instead of\nusing the little r'sfor the different\npayments, coupon bondsare often quoted with a\nsingle number that is a yield.So the theoretically correct\nway to write the priceis given up there.P0 is equal to C,\nall the coupons,divided by the\nappropriate big R's.Or we could replace every\none of those big R'swith the appropriate little r.By appropriate little r, I mean,\nlittle r 0,1, little r 0,2,too little r 0,3--each of those.But we can also\ncalculate an averageof all of those little r's\nand just use one variable.And to simplify notation, I'm\ngoing to give it a completelydifferent symbol, Y, and say, ,\nwhat is that single number, Y,that will give me the\nprice of the bond?And that Y is known as the\nparticular bond's yield.It is the single\ninterest rate which,if interest rates were\nconstant throughout time,", "start": 3360.0, "heat": 0.284}, {"text": "would make the present value of\nall the coupons and principalequal to the current price.So if you think\nabout a mortgage,and you ask the question,\nif the mortgage rateis 5%, what is the\nvalue of the loan,that's exactly this\nexpression right here.Now, obviously, when you get a\nfixed rate mortgage of 5.89%,you know that the interest\nrate is not reallygoing to be 5.98% forever.The interest rate\nchanges every year.But that 5.98% is an average\nof the 30-year period whereyou're going to be borrowing\nthat mortgage money.So you can think of this coupon\nbond in exactly the same way.We quote this\nnumber Y as a yield.Sometimes, we talk about\nyield instead of prices.But the way that we\nfigure out the yieldis, we take this\n30-year bond thatpays 5% a year,\nwe auction it off,and we figure out\nwhat the price is.Given the price, we\ncan find the yield.Finding the yield is not\nso easy in this case,because in this case, unlike\njust taking a simple geometricaverage, which is what we did\nto calculate the little r's fromthe big R's--in this case, in\norder to find the Y,we actually have to\nsolve an equation thatcan be highly non-linear.In fact, it's a polynomial.It's a t-th order polynomial.And for those of you high\nschool math team jocks,you'll remember that when\nyou've got a t-th orderpolynomial, first of all,\nyou have a lot of solutions.How many solutions do\nyou typically have?t.And of those solutions,\nhow many of themare guaranteed to\nbe real

numbers.And they are quite complex,\nso I won't talk about them.But these kinds of equations--it turns out that\nthey're not guaranteedto even have real solutions.Now, it turns out\nthat for bonds,where the coupon\npayments are all positiveand the principle\nis all positive,it turns out in that\nvery restrictive--and the price is positive.It turns out in those cases, you\nactually do get a real number--at least, one real number.The problem is\nthat in some cases,you get multiple real numbers.And then, it's very, very\nhard to figure out which yieldis the correct one to use.The only reason I'm\ntelling you about thisis because it turns out\nas a matter of convention,very often, people will quote\nthese little Y yields whenthey talk about coupon bonds.But the way to\nthink about that isto think about the\nprice, which isthe present value of the coupon\npayments as a present discountvalue of the interest that\nreally applies between todayand date t.In fact, in order to do this\npresent value calculation,you need not just\none interest rate.How many interest\nrates do you need?t, right?You're at year zero,\nand you've got paymentsfor every single\nyear between 1 and t.So you need interest rates\nthat apply between 0 and 1, 0and 2, 0 and 3, and so on.You need t interest\nrates or exchange rates.Right?Or exchanges between\ndifferent dates.But now, the yield is\nimportant because itallows us to quote the\npseudo rate of returnof this bond in a single number.", "start": 3600.0, "heat": 0.361}, {"text": "And very often, people will\nplot the Y's as a

30--those have coupon payments,\nand those are the coupon rates.And they have prices,\nand they have yields.So what's plotted here\nis not the little r.It's the Y for the coupon bonds.And so the reason that\nthey're not the sameis because the yields,\nthe little Y's, dependon the coupon payments.And really strictly\nspeaking, we don'tcare about coupon payments when\nwe look at time to

one-year yield for\nUS Treasury bills is 12%.12% back in 1982--and there is a point at which\none of the longer maturityinstruments reaches\na peak of 16% or 17%.Remember, I told you, I\nwas looking to get a houseand get a mortgage at 18%.That was a 30-year fixed\nrate back in the 1980s.So borrowing rates\nare very, very lowby these historical standards.If borrowing rates\nare very low, whatdoes that tell you about credit\nand about the amount of cashsloshing around in the economy?Yeah?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]ANDREW LO: Exactly--\nlots and lotsand lots of money available.So for those of you\nwho are thinkingabout entrepreneurial\nventures-- if you'rethinking about\nraising capital, youmight be depressed by what's\ngoing on in markets today.But look at the interest\nrate and ask yourself,gee, would I rather start a\ncompany today or back in 1982?There's a heck of a\nlot more money sloshingaround the system today.In fact, a few years\nago, I talked to a coupleof MIT undergraduates.One of them came up and\nasked me whether I'dbe willing to advise them on\nsome internet company theywanted to start.And you know, I said, well,\nyou know, where are yougoing to get your financing?And they

know what?That's the cheapest venture\nfinancing you'll ever find.And they're right, because\nthose are non-recourse loans.They don't take a\npiece of your company.And 18% for a venture is\nactually pretty attractive.Well, look at what the\nborrowing rate is now.Now, you can't borrow at\nthis rate for ventures,but it indicates that there's\na lot of credit out there,and there's still a lot\nof credit out there.In fact, the\ntreasury and the Fedwould argue there's too\nmuch credit out there.And that's why we're in the\nproblems that we are today.Because too many people--people that should not have\nbeen leveraging and borrowinghave done so.And now, we're feeling the\npains of a contraction.So this is the history\nof yield curves.And at a given point in time, we\ncan take a look at yield curvesand see how that curve\nchanges day to day.I showed you today's yield\ncurve, which is upward sloping.But you know, there was\na period back in 2000where this yield curve was\nactually upward-sloping,and then downward-sloping.Why would the yield curve\nbe downward-sloping?What that tells\nyou is that there'san expectation of the\nmarket participantsthat interest rates in the\nlong run have got to come down,and that there's going to\nbe some kind of Fed policyshift possible within three\nyears, five years, 10 years,that would make that\nmore likely than not.So by looking at these yield\ncurves over different dates,you can get a sense of how\nthe market's expectations areof the future, which I think\nis a tremendous abilityto actually look into the\nfuture-- at least

that\nwe'd like to be able to dois to try to model that term\nstructure interest rates.Is there any logic\nthat we can come upwith that explains\nwhy the yield curve isupward-sloping

mention\nthe names so that you'llknow that there are theories\nout there that will tell youwhether or not the yield curve\nshould be so steeply slopedor not.There's something called\nthe Expectations Hypothesis.There is something\ncalled the LiquidityPreference Hypothesis.There is a Preferred Habitat\nModel, Market SegmentationModel.And then, there are a whole\nslew of extraordinarilysophisticated and complex\nmathematical models,one of which--and probably the\nbest known of which--was developed by our very\nown John Cox and Steve Ross.The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross\nmodel of the term structureof interest rates is probably\nthe single best known yieldcurve model.It's a very complicated\nmodel, but ithas some pretty\nsignificant implicationsfor whether the\nyield curve oughtto be upward-sloping\nor downward-sloping,or how it changes over time.I'll give you one example\nof what these theories are,and I won't spend\nmuch time on it,but I want to at least leave\nyou with some intuitionfor how you would go\nabout modeling it.So one model says that today's\nforward rates are in fact", "start": 4080.0, "heat": 0.225}, {"text": "the best guess of what future\nspot rates are likely to be,and that's known as the\nExpectations Hypothesis.This hypothesis states that\ntoday's forward rate, whichis what we do observe, is equal\nto the mathematical expectationtoday, of the future\none-year spot rate.Now, you might say,\nwell, that's notthat's not much of a theory.I mean, what else could it be?Well, it turns out that there\nis another theory calledthe Preferred Liquidity\nPreference Theory thatsays that the longer\nthe term of borrowing,the more you're going to have\nto pay a premium for peopleto lend to you, because\npeople would prefer liquidity.So the longer you\ndemand the borrowingfor a greater period of time,\nthe more you have to pay--much more so than just linearly.So in particular, the\nExpectations Hypothesissuggests that the\nyield curve is flat.Right?There's no impact on borrowing\nfor two years, three years,five years, 10 years.The future rate\nis just equal to--today's forward rate is the\nexpectation of the future.OK?It's a fair bet.Liquidity Preference\nsays that the yield curveshould be upward-sloping,\nbecause it'sgoing to be more costly\nfor you to borrowover a three-year period than\na one-year period, simplybecause it's going\nto entail somebodygiving up their money for\na longer period of time.They're going to be less liquid.You're going to have to bribe\nthem to be willing to give upthat liquidity.That's the

when, if you\ndon't own the security,you can borrow it from a\nbroker, and then sell it,and you'll collect the\nmoney from selling it.Now, the broker,\nobviously, is goingto want you to keep that\nmoney in that brokerage firmso that you don't\nrun away with it.Because you've borrowed\nthe security at some point,you've got to pay it back.You've got to return\nthat security.Right?So the

their face value.You're going to use those to\npay the coupons of the bondsthat you sold.And therefore, you have\nno further obligations,but you have a pile of\nmoney in front of you.That's pretty cool.And if you do that a lot,\nthat pile of money grows.So obviously, we know\nit's not easy to do that.And if it's not easy\nto do that, thatmeans that our assumption\nthat the bond was greaterthan the cost of the\nstrips can't be true.If you reverse the logic,\nyou get the same kindof argument in reverse.Therefore, the only\nthing that could beis that the prices are\nequal to each other.Next
