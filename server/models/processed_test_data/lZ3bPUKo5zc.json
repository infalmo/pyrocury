final timethat I will be\nteaching this class.So I'm pretty excited about it.So my name is Allan Adams.I'll be lecturing the course.I'm an assistant\nprofessor in Course 8.I study string theory\nand its applicationsto gravity, quantum gravity,\nand condensed matter physics.Quantum mechanics, this is a\ncourse in quantam mechanics.Quantam mechanics Is\nmy daily language.Quantum mechanics\nis my old friend.I met quantum\nmechanics 20 years ago.I just realized that last night.It was kind of depressing.So, old friend.It's also my most powerful tool.So I'm pretty psyched about it.Our recitation instructors\nare Barton Zwiebach, yea!And Matt Evans-- yea!Matt's new to the\ndepartment, so welcome him.Hi.So he just started\nhis faculty position,which is pretty awesome.And our TA is Paolo Glorioso.Paolo, are you here?Yea!There you go.OK, so he's the person to\nsend all complaints to.So just out of curiosity, how\nmany of you all are Course 8?Awesome.How many of you all\nare, I don't know, 18?Solid.6?Excellent.9?No one?This is the first year we\nhaven't had anyone Course 9.That's a shame.Last year one of\nthe best studentswas a Course 9 student.So two practical things to know.",

including your grades.The second thing\nis that as you maynotice there are rather\nmore lights than usual.I'm wearing a mic.And there are these signs up.We're going to be\nvideotaping this coursefor the lectures for OCW.And if you're happy\nwith that, cool.If not, just sit on\nthe sides and youwon't appear anywhere on video.Sadly, I can't do that.But you're welcome\nto if you like.But hopefully that should\nnot play a meaningful rolein any of the lectures.So the goal of 804 is for you\nto learn quantum mechanics.And by learn\nquantum mechanics, Idon't mean to learn\nhow to do calculations,although that's an important\nand critical thing.I mean learn some intuition.I want you to develop\nsome intuitionfor quantum phenomena.Now, quantam\nmechanics is not hard.It has a reputation\nfor being a hard topic.It is not a super hard topic.So in particular,\neveryone in this room,I'm totally positive, can\nlearn quantum mechanics.It does require\nconcerted effort.It's not a trivial topic.And in order to really\ndevelop a good intuition,the essential thing\nis to solve problems.So the way you develop\na new intuitionis by solving problems\nand by dealingwith new situations, new\ncontext, new regimes, whichis what we're\ngoing to do in 804.It's essential that you work\nhard on the problem sets.So your job is to devote\nyourself to the problem sets.My job is to convince you\nat the end of every lecturethat the most interesting\nthing you could possiblydo when you leave\nis the problem set.So you decide who\nhas the harder job.So the workload is not so bad.",

much.But we will drop one\nproblem set to make upfor unanticipated events.We'll return the\ngraded problem setsa week later in recitation.Should be easy.I strongly, strongly\nencourage youto collaborate with other\nstudents on your problem sets.You will learn more,\nthey will learn more,it will be more efficient.Work together.However, write your\nproblem sets yourself.That's the best way for\nyou to develop and testyour understanding.There will be two midterms,\ndates to be announced,and one final.I guess we could have\nmultiple, but thatwould be a little exciting.We're going to use clickers,\nand clickers will be required.We're not going to\ntake attendance,but they will give\na small contributionto your overall grade.And we'll use them\nmost importantlyfor non-graded but just\nparticipation concept questionsand the occasional in class\nquiz to probe your knowledge.This is mostly so that\nyou have a real timemeasure of your own conceptual\nunderstanding of the material.This has been\nenormously valuable.And something I want\nto say just right offis that the way I've\norganized this classis not so much based on\nthe classes I was taught.It's based to the degree\npossible on empirical lessonsabout what works\nin teaching, whatactually makes you learn better.And clickers are an\nexcellent example of that.So this is mostly a\nstandard lecture course,but there will be clickers used.So by next week I need\nyou all to have clickers,and I need you to register\nthem on the TSG website.I haven't chosen a\nspecific textbook.And this is discussed\non the Stellar web page.There are a set of textbooks,\nfour textbooks that I stronglyrecommend, and a set of others\nthat are nice references.The reason for this is twofold.First off, there\nare two languages", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.107}, {"text": "that are canonically used\nfor quantum mechanics.One is called wave\nmechanics, and the language,the mathematical language is\npartial differential equations.The other is a matrix mechanics.They have big names.And the language there\nis linear algebra.And different books\nemphasize different aspectsand use different languages.And they also try to aim\nat different problems.Some books are\naimed towards peoplewho are interested in materials\nscience, some books thatare aimed towards people\ninterested in philosophy.And depending on\nwhat you want, getthe book that's suited to you.And every week I'll be providing\nwith your problem sets readingsfrom each of the\nrecommended texts.So what I really encourage you\nto do is find a group of peopleto work with every\nweek, and make surethat you've got all the\nbooks covered between you.This'll give you as\nmuch access to the textsas possible without forcing\nyou to buy four books, whichI would discourage\nyou from doing.So finally I guess\nthe last thing to sayis if this stuff\nwere totally trivial,you wouldn't need to be here.So ask questions.If you're confused\nabout something,lots of other\npeople in the classare also going to be confused.And if I'm not answering your\nquestion without you asking,then no one's getting\nthe point, right?So ask questions.Don't hesitate to interrupt.Just raise your hand, and I\nwill do my best to call on you.And this is true\nfor both in lecture,also go to office\nhours and recitations.Ask questions.I promise, there's no such\nthing as a terrible question.Someone else will\nalso be confused.So it's a very valuable\nto me and everyone else.So before I get going\non the actual physicscontent of the class, are there\nany other practical questions?Yeah.AUDIENCE: You said there\nwas a lateness policy.ALLAN ADAMS: Lateness policy.No late work is\naccepted whatsoever.So the deal is given that\nevery

to have to worry\nabout my problem set.Could we work this out?So if you know ahead\nof time, come to us.But you need to do that\nwell ahead of time.The night before doesn't count.OK?Yeah.AUDIENCE:

stuff.today I want to describe\nto you a particular setof experiments.Now, to my mind, these are the\nmost unsettling experimentsever done.These experiments\ninvolve electrons.They have been performed,\nand the resultsas I will describe\nthem are true.I'm going to focus on two\nproperties of electrons.I will call them\ncolor and hardness.And these are not\nthe technical names.We'll learn the technical\nnames for these propertieslater on in the semester.But to avoid distracting you\nby preconceived notions of whatthese things mean, I'm going\nto use ambiguous labels, colorand hardness.And the empirical fact is that\nevery electron, every electronthat's ever been observed\nis either black or whiteand no other color.We've never seen\na blue electron.There are no green electrons.No one has ever found\na fluorescent electron.They're either black,\nor they are white.It is a binary property.Secondly, their hardness\nis either hard or soft.They're never squishy.No one's ever found\none that dribbles.They are either hard,\nor they are soft.Binary properties.OK?", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Now, what I mean\nby this is that itis possible to\nbuild a device whichmeasures the color\nand the hardness.In particular, it\nis possible to builda box, which I will call a color\nbox, that measures the color.And the way it works is this.It has three apertures,\nan in port and two outports, one which sends\nout black electronsand one which sends\nout white electrons.And the utility of this\nbox is that the colorcan be inferred\nfrom the position.If you find the particle,\nthe electron over here,it is a white electron.If you find the electron\nhere, it is a black electron.Cool?Similarly, we can\nbuild a hardness box,which again has three\napertures, an in port.And hard electrons\ncome out this port,and soft electrons\ncome out this port.Now, if you want, you're free\nto imagine that these boxes arebuilt by putting\na monkey inside.And you send in an\nelectron, and the monkey,you know, with the ears,\nlooks at the electron,and says it's a hard electron,\nit sends it out one way,or it's a soft electron,\nit sends it out the other.The workings inside\ndo not matter.And in particular,\nlater in the semesterI will describe in\nconsiderable detailthe workings inside\nthis apparatus.And here's something I\nwant to emphasize to you.It can be built in\nprinciple using monkeys,hyper intelligent monkeys\nthat can see electrons.It could also be built using\nmagnets and silver atoms.It could be done with neutrons.It could be done with all sorts\nof different technologies.And they all give\nprecisely the same resultsas I'm about to describe.They all give precisely\nthe same results.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So it does not\nmatter what's inside.But if you want a\nlittle idea, youcould imagine putting a monkey\ninside, a hyper intelligentmonkey.I know, it sounds good.So a key property of these\nhardness boxes and color boxesis that they are repeatable.And here's what I mean by that.If I send in an electron,\nand I find that it comes outof a color box black, and\nthen I send it in again,then if I send it into\nanother color box,it comes out black again.So in diagrams, if I send\nin some random electronto a color box, and I discover\nthat it comes out, let's say,the white aperture.And so here's dot dot dot, and\nI take the ones that come outthe white aperture, and I send\nthem into a color box again.Then with 100% confidence,\n100% of the time, the electroncoming out of the white port\nincident on the color boxwill come out the\nwhite aperture again.And 0% of the time will it\ncome out the black aperture.So this is a\npersistent property.You notice that it's white.You measure it again,\nit's still white.Do a little bit later,\nit's still white.OK?It's a persistent property.Ditto the hardness.If I send in a bunch of\nelectrons in to a hardness box,here is an important thing.Well, send them\ninto a hardness box,and I take out the ones\nthat come out soft.And I send them again\ninto a hardness box,and they come out soft.They will come\nout soft with 100%confidence, 100% of the time.Never do they come\nout the hard aperture.Any questions at this point?So here's a natural question.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Might the color and the hardness\nof an electron be related?And more precisely,\nmight they be correlated?Might knowing the color infer\nsomething about the hardness?So for example, so being\nmale and being a bachelorare correlated properties,\nbecause if you're male,you don't know if you're\na bachelor or not,but if you're a\nbachelor, you're male.That's the definition\nof the word.So is it possible that\ncolor and hardnessare similarly correlated?So, I don't know, there\nare lots of good examples,like wearing a red shirt and\nbeaming down to the surfaceand making it back\nto the Enterpriselater after the\naway team returns.Correlated, right?Negatively, but correlated.So the question\nis, suppose, e.g.,suppose we know that\nan electron is white.Does that determine\nthe hardness?So we can answer this\nquestion by using our boxes.So here's what I'm going to do.I'm going to take some\nrandom set of electrons.That's not random.Random.And I'm going to send\nthem in to a color box.And I'm going to take\nthe electrons thatcome out the white aperture.And here's a useful fact.When I say random, here's\noperationally what I mean.I take some piece of\nmaterial, I scrape it,I pull off some electrons,\nand they're totallyrandomly chosen\nfrom the material.And I send them in.If I send a random pile of\nelectrons into a color box,useful thing to know, they\ncome out about half and half.It's just some\nrandom assortment.Some of them are white,\nsome of them come out black.Suppose I send some random\ncollection of electronsinto a color box.And I take those which come\nout the white aperture.And I want to know, does\nwhite determine hardness.So I can do that, check, by then\nsending these white electrons", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "into a hardness box and\nseeing what comes out.Hard, soft.And what we find is that 50%\nof those electrons incidenton the hardness box come out\nhard, and 50% come out soft.OK?And ditto if we reverse this.If we take hardness, and take,\nfor example, a soft electronand send it into a color\nbox, we again get 50-50.So if you take a white\nelectron, you send itinto a hardness box,\nyou're at even odds,you're at chance\nas to whether it'sgoing to come out hard or soft.And similarly, if you\nsend a soft electroninto a color box,\neven odds it's goingto come out black or white.So knowing the hardness\ndoes not give youany information about the\ncolor, and knowing the colordoes not give you any\ninformation about the hardness.cool?These are independent facts,\nindependent properties.They're not correlated\nin this sense,in precisely this\noperational sense.Cool?Questions?OK.So measuring the color\ngive zero predictive powerfor the hardness, and\nmeasuring the hardnessgives zero predictive\npower for the color.And from that, I will\nsay that these propertiesare correlated.So H, hardness, and color are\nin this sense uncorrelated.So using these properties of\nthe color and hardness boxes,I want to run a few\nmore experiment's.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.248}, {"text": "I want to probe these\nproperties of color and hardnessa little more.And in particular,\nknowing these resultsallows us to make predictions,\nto predict the resultsfor set a very\nsimple experiments.Now, what we're going to\ndo for the next bit iswe're going to run some\nsimple experiments.And we're going to\nmake predictions.And then those\nsimple experimentsare going to lead us to more\ncomplicated experiments.But let's make sure we\nunderstand the simple onesfirst.So for example, let's take\nthis last experiment, colorand hardness, and\nlet's add a color box.One more monkey.So color in, and\nwe take those thatcome out the white aperture.And we send them\ninto a hardness box.Hard, soft.And we take those\nelectrons whichcome out the soft aperture.And now let's send these\nagain into a color box.So it's easy to see\nwhat to predict.Black, white.So you can imagine a monkey\ninside this, going, aha.You look at it, you\ninspect, it comes out white.Here you look at it and\ninspect, it comes out soft.And you send it\ninto the color box,and what do you\nexpect to happen?Well, let's think\nabout the logic here.Anything reaching\nthe hardness boxmust have been\nmeasured to be white.And we just did the\nexperiment that if yousend a white electron\ninto a hardness box,50% of the time it comes\nout a hard aperture and 50%of the time it comes\nout the soft aperture.So now we take that\n50% of electronsthat comes out the soft\naperture, which had previouslybeen observed to\nbe white and soft.And then we send them into a\ncolor box, and what happens?Well, since colors\nare repeatable,the natural expectation is that,\nof course, it comes out white.So our prediction,\nour natural predictionhere is that of those electrons\nthat are incident on this colorbox, 100% should come out white,\nand 0% should come out black.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "That seem like a reasonable--\nlet's just make surethat we're all agreeing.So let's vote.How many people think\nthis is probably correct?OK, good.How many people think\nthis probably wrong?OK, good.That's reassuring.Except you're all wrong.Right?In fact, what happens is\nhalf of these electrons exitwhite, 50%.And 50% percent exit black.So let's think about\nwhat's going on here.This is really\nkind of troubling.We've said already\nthat knowing the colordoesn't predict the hardness.And yet, this electron,\nwhich was previouslymeasured to be white, now when\nsubsequently measured sometimesit comes out white,\nsometimes it comes outblack, 50-50% of the time.So that's surprising.What that tells you is you\ncan't think of the electronas a little ball that has black\nand soft written on it, right?You can't, because apparently\nthat black and softisn't a persistent\nthing, although it'spersistent in the sense\nthat once it's black,it stays black.So what's going on here?Now, I should emphasize\nthat the same thing happensif I had changed this to\ntaking the black electronsand throwing in a hardness and\npicking soft and then measuringthe color, or if I had\nused the hard electrons.Any of those combinations,\nany of these portswould have given the\nsame results, 50-50.Is not persistent in this sense.Apparently the presence\nof the hardness boxtampers with the color somehow.So it's not quite as trivial is\nthat hyper intelligent monkey.Something else is going on here.So this is suspicious.So here's the\nfirst natural move.The first natural move\nis, oh, look, surely", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "there's some additional\nproperty of the electronthat we just\nhaven't measured yetthat determines whether it\ncomes out the second colorbox black or

there'sany sort of feature of\nthese incident electronswhich determines which\nport they come out of.And the shocker is no one's\never found such a property.No one has ever found\na property whichdetermines which\nport it comes out of.As far as we can tell,\nit is completely random.Those that flip and\nthose that don't areindistinguishable at beginning.And let me just emphasize, if\nanyone found such a-- it's notlike we're not looking, right?If anyone found such a\nproperty, fame, notoriety,subverting quantum\nmechanics, Nobel Prize.People have looked.And there is none that\nanyone's been able to find.And as we'll see later on,\nusing Bell's inequality,we can more or less nail\nthat such things don't exist,such a fact doesn't exist.But this tells us something\nreally disturbing.This tells us, and this\nis the first real shocker,that there is something\nintrinsically unpredictable,non-deterministic, and random\nabout physical processesthat we observe in a laboratory.There's no way to determine\na priori whether itwill come out black or\nwhite from the second box.Probability in this\nexperiment, it'sforced upon us by observations.OK, well, there's another\nway to come at this.You could say, look, you ran\nthis experiment, that's fine.But look, I've met the\nguy who built these boxes,and look, he's just\nsome guy, right?And he just didn't\ndo a very good job.The boxes are just badly built.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So here's the way to\ndefeat that argument.No, we've built these things\nout of different materials,using different technologies,\nusing electrons, usingneutrons, using bucky-balls,\nC60, seriously, it's been done.We've done this experiment, and\nthis property does not change.It is persistent.And the thing that's most\nupsetting to me is that notonly do we get the same results\nindependent of what objects weuse to run the experiment, we\ncannot change the probabilityaway from 50-50 at all.Within experimental\ntolerances, we cannot change,no matter how we\nbuild the boxes,we cannot change the\nprobability by part in 100.50-50.And to anyone who grew up\nwith determinism from Newton,this should hurt.This should feel wrong.But it's a property\nof the real world.And our job is going\nto be to deal with it.Rather, your job is going to\nbe to deal with it, because Iwent through this already.So here's a curious\nconsequence-- oh,any questions before I cruise?OK.So here's a curious consequence\nof this series of experiments.Here's something you can't do.Are you guys old enough for you\ncan't do this on television?This is so sad.OK, so here's\nsomething you can't do.We cannot build, it is\nimpossible to build,a reliable color\nand hardness box.We've built a box

you.Here's a hardness box.And it has an in port.And the hardness box\nhas a hard aperture,and it has a soft aperture.And now, in addition\nto this hardness box,I'm going to introduce\ntwo elements.First, mirrors.And what these mirrors do\nis they take the incidentelectrons and,\nnothing else, theychange the direction of motion,\nchange the direction of motion.And here's what I mean\nby

with\nthe hardness box,it doesn't change the hardness.It just changes the\ndirection of motion.And every experiment we've\never done on these, guys,changes in no way\nwhatsoever the coloror the hardness by\nsubsequent measurement.Cool?Just changes the\ndirection of motion.And then I'm going to\nadd another mirror.It's actually a slightly\nfancy set of mirrors.All they do is they join\nthese beams togetherinto a single beam.And again, this doesn't\nchange the color.You send in a white\nelectron, you get out,and you measure the\ncolor on the other side,you get a white electron.You send in a black\nelectron from here,and you measure the color, you\nget a black electron again out.Cool?So here's my apparatus.And I'm going to put\nthis inside a big box.And I want to run\nsome experimentswith this apparatus.Everyone cool with\nthe basic design?Any questions\nbefore I cruise on?This part's fun.So what I want to\ndo now is I wantto run some simple experiments\nbefore we get

done\nthat experiment,and we get 50-50\nout, black and white.So those electrons that came\nout hard come out 50-50,and those electrons that\ncome out soft come out 50/50.And the logic then leads\nto

way.I take a random\nsource of electrons,I rub a cat against a balloon\nand I charge up the balloon.And so I take those\nrandom electrons,and I send them\ninto a color box.And we have previously\nobserved that if youtake random electrons and\nthrow them into a color boxand pull out the electrons that\ncome out the white aperture,if you then send\nthem into a color boxagain, they're still white.So that's how I've\ngenerated them.I could have done it by\nrubbing the cat against glass,or rubbing it against me,\nright, just stroke the cat.Any randomly selected\nset of electronssent

very careful notto say in this class\nto the degree possible.I'm not going to use\nthe word to know.AUDIENCE: Well, to\nmeasure. [INAUDIBLE]ALLAN ADAMS: Good.Measure is a very\nslippery word, too.I've used it here\nbecause I couldn't reallyget away with not using it.But we'll talk about\nthat in some detaillater on in the course.For the moment, I\nwant to emphasizethat it's tempting but dangerous\nat this point to talk aboutwhether you know or don't\nknow, or whether someone knowsor doesn't know, for\nexample, the monkeyinside knows or doesn't know.So let's try to\navoid that, and focuson just operational questions of\nwhat are the things that go in,what are the things that\ncome out, and with whatprobabilities.And the reason\nthat's so useful isthat it's something\nthat you can just do.There's no ambiguity\nabout whether you'vecaught a white electron\nin a particular spot.Now in particular,\nthe reason these boxesare such a powerful tool is that\nyou don't measure the electron,you measure the position\nof the electron.You get hit by the\nelectron or you don't.And by using these boxes we\ncan infer from their positionthe color or the hardness.And that's the reason\nthese boxes are so useful.So we're inferring from\nthe position, whichis easy to measure,\nyou get beanedor you don't, we're\ninferring the propertythat we're interested in.It's a really good\nquestion, though.Keep it in the\nback of your mind.And we'll talk about it\non and off for the restof the semester.Yeah.AUDIENCE: So what happens\nif you have this setup,and you just take away\nthe bottom right mirror?ALLAN ADAMS: Perfect question.This leads me into\nthe next experiment.So here's the modification.But thank you, that's\na great question.Here's the modification\nof this experiment.So let's rig up a\nsmall-- hold on,I want to go through the\nnext series of experiments,and then I'll come\nback to questions.And these are great questions.So I want to rig up a small\nmovable wall, a small movablebarrier.And here's what this\nmovable barrier will do.", "start": 3240.0, "heat": 0.1},

white\nelectrons, and at the outputwe measure the color as before.And the question is what\nfraction come out black,and what fraction\ncome out white.So again, everyone think\nthrough it for a second.Just take a second.And this one's a little sneaky.So feel free to discuss it with\nthe person sitting next to you.[CHATTER]", "start": 3360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "ALLAN ADAMS: All right.All right, now that everyone\nhas had a quick secondto think through\nthis one, let me justtalk through what I'd\nexpect from the pointof these experiments.And then we'll talk about\nwhether this is reasonable.So the first thing I\nexpect is that, look,if I send in a white\nelectron and I put itinto a hardness pass, I know\nthat 50% of the time it goesout hard, and 50% of the\ntime it goes out soft.If it goes out\nthe soft aperture,it's going to get eaten\nby the barrier, right?It's going to get\neaten by the barrier.So first thing I predict\nis that the outputshould be down by 50%.However, here's an\nimportant bit of physics.And this comes to\nthe idea of locality.I didn't tell you\nthis, but thesearmlinks in the experiment I\ndid, 3,000 kilometers long.3,000 kilometers long.That's too minor.10 million kilometers long.Really long.", "start": 3480.0, "heat": 0.138}, {"text": "Very long.Now, imagine an\nelectron that entersthis, an initially\nwhite electron.If we had the barriers out,\nif the barrier was out,what do we get?100% white, right?We just did this\nexperiment, to our surprise.So if we did this, we get 100%.And that means an\nelectron, any electron,going along the soft\npath comes out white.Any electron going along the\nhard path goes out white.They all come out white.So now, imagine I do this.Imagine we put a barrier in\nhere 2 million miles awayfrom this path.How does a hard\nelectron along this pathknow that I put\nthe barrier there?And I'm going to make it\neven more sneaky for you.I'm going to insert the\nbarrier along the pathafter I launched the\nelectron into the apparatus.And when I send in the electron,\nI will not know at that moment,nor will the electron\nknow, because, youknow, they're not very\nsmart, whether the barrier isin place.And this is going to be millions\nof miles away from this guy.So an electron out\nhere can't know.It hasn't been there.It just hasn't been there.It can't know.But we know that when\nwe ran this apparatuswithout the barrier in there,\nthey came out 100% white.But it can't possibly know\nwhether the barrier's inthere or not, right?It's over here.So what this tells us is that\nwe should expect the outputto be down by 50%.But all the electrons\nthat do makeit through must come\nout white, because theydidn't know that there\nwas a barrier there.They didn't go along that path.Yeah.AUDIENCE:

if they come\nout one at a time white,then wouldn't we know\nthen with certaintythat that electron is\nboth hard and white,which is like a violation?ALLAN ADAMS: Well, here's\nthe more troubling thing.Imagine it didn't\ncome out 100% white.Then the electron would\nhave demonstrably notgo along the soft path.It would have demonstrably\ngone through the hard path,because that's the only\npath available to it.And yet, it would still have\nknown that millions of milesaway, there's a barrier\non a path it didn't take.So which one's more\nupsetting to you?And personally, I find this one\nthe less upsetting of the two.So the prediction is our\noutput should down by 50%,because a half of\nthem get eaten.But they should\nall come out white,because those that\ndidn't get eatencan't possibly know that\nthere was a barrier here,millions of miles away.So we run this experiment.And here's the\nexperimental result.In fact, the experimental\nresult is yes, the outputis down by 50%.But no, not 100%\nwhite, 50% white.50% white.The barrier, if we put the\nbarrier in the hardness path.If we put the barrier\nin the hardness path,still down by 50%, and\nit's at odds, 50-50.How could the electron know?I'm making fun of it.Yeah.AUDIENCE: So I\nguess my question isbefore we ask how it\nknows that there'sa block in one of the paths,\nhow does it know, before,over there, that there were\ntwo paths, and combine again?ALLAN ADAMS: Excellent.Exactly.So actually, this\nproblem was there alreadyin the experiment we did.All we've done here\nis tease out somethingthat was existing in the\nexperiment, somethingthat was disturbing.The presence of those\nmirrors, and the optionof taking two paths,\nsomehow changedthe way the electron behaved.How is that possible?And here, we're seeing\nthat very sharply.Thank you for that\nexcellent observation.Yeah.AUDIENCE: What if you\nreplaced the two mirrors", "start": 3720.0, "heat": 0.109}, {"text": "with color boxes, so that\nboth

here's the thing\nI want to emphasize.I strongly encourage you to\nthink through that example.And in particular, think through\nthat example, come to my officehours, and ask me about it.So that's going to be setting\na different experiment.And different\nexperiments are goingto have different results.So we're going to have to\ndeal with that on a caseby case basis.It's an interesting\nexample,

color\nbox, we put in white electronsand we got 50-50, like random.How do you know the boxes work?ALLAN ADAMS: How do I\nknow the boxes work?These are the same boxes\nwe used from the beginning.We

is that you send\nin color and it comes out coloragain, and the mirrors\nbehave this way.Any box that does those\nfirst set of things, whichis what I will call a\ncolor box, does this, too.There's no other way to do it.I don't mean just because\nlike, no one's tested--AUDIENCE: Because you\ncan't actually check it,you can't actually [INAUDIBLE]\nyou know which one is white.ALLAN ADAMS: Oh, sure, you can.You take the electron that\ncame out of the color box.That's what we mean\nby saying it's white.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]ALLAN ADAMS: But\nthat's what it meansto say the electron is white.It's like, how do you know\nthat my name is Allan?You say, Allan, and I go, what?Right?But you're like, look that's\nnot a test of whether I'm Allan.It's like, well,\nwhat is the test?That's how you test.What's your name?I'm Allan.Oh, great, that's your name.So that's what I mean by white.Now you might quibble\nthat that's a stupid thingto call an electron.And I grant you that.But it is nonetheless a property\nthat I can empirically engage.OK, so I've been told\nthat I never ask questionsfrom the people on the right.Yeah.AUDIENCE: Is it important\nwhether the experimenterknows if the

to think through\nwhat that's telling usabout the electron,\nthe single electron,as it transits the apparatus.The thing is, at this point\nwe're in real trouble.And here's the reason.Consider a single electron\ninside the apparatus.And I want to think about the\nelectron inside the apparatuswhile all walls are out.So it's this experiment.Consider the single electron.We know, with total confidence,\nwith complete reliability,that every electron\nwill exit this color boxout the white aperture.We've done this experiment.We know it will come out white.Yes?Here's my question.Which route did it take?AUDIENCE: Spoiler.ALLAN ADAMS: Not a spoiler.Which route did it take?AUDIENCE: Why do\nwe care what route?ALLAN ADAMS: I'm asking\nyou the question.That's why you care.I'm the professor

the hardness path?Ladies and gentlemen, did\nit take the hard path?AUDIENCE: Yes.ALLAN ADAMS: Well, we\nran this experimentby putting a wall\nin the soft path.And if we put a wall\nin the soft path,then we know it\ntook the hard path,because no other\nelectrons come outexcept those that went\nthrough the hard path.Correct?On the other hand, if it\nwent through the hard path,it would come out\n50% of the time whiteand 50% of the time black.But in fact, in this apparatus\nit comes out always 100% white.It cannot have\ntaken the hard path.No.Did it take the soft path?Same argument,\ndifferent side, right?No.Well, this is not looking good.Well, look, this was suggested.Maybe it took both.Maybe electrons are\nsneaky little devilsthat split in two, and part of\nit goes one way and part of itgoes the other.Maybe it took both paths.So this is easy.We can test this one.And here is how I'm\ngoing to test this one.Oh, sorry.Actually, I'm not\ngoing to do that yet.So we can test this one.So if it took both paths, here's\nwhat you should be able to do.You should be able to put\na detector along each path,and you'd be able\nto follow, if you'vegot half an electron on one\nside and half an electronon the other, or\nmaybe two electrons,one on each side and\none on the other.So this is the thing\nthat you'd predictif you said it went both.So here's what we'll do.We

electron.You see one electron\non one path, period.It did not take both.You never see an electron split\nin two, divided, confused.No.Well, it didn't\ntake the hard path,didn't take the soft\npath, it didn't take both.There's one option left.Neither.Well, I say neither.But what about neither?And that's easy.Let's put a barrier\nin both paths.And then what happens?Nothing comes out.So no.So now, to
