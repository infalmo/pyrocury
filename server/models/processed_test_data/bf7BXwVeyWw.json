[{"text": "Translator: Jenny ZurawellA few months agothe Nobel Prize in physicswas awarded to two teams of astronomersfor a discovery that has been hailedas one of the most importantastronomical observations ever.And today, after briefly describing what they found,I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial frameworkfor explaining their discovery,namely the possibilitythat way beyond the Earth,the Milky Way and other distant galaxies,we may find that our universeis not the only universe,but is insteadpart of a vast complex of universesthat we call the multiverse.Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one.I mean, most of us were raised to believethat the word \"universe\" means everything.And I say most of us with forethought,as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born.And last year I was holding herand I said, \"Sophia,I love you more than anything in the universe.\"And she turned to me and said, \"Daddy,universe or multiverse?\"(Laughter)But barring such an anomalous upbringing,it is strange to imagineother realms separate from ours,most with fundamentally different features,that would rightly be called universes of their own.And yet,speculative though the idea surely is,I aim to convince youthat there's reason for taking it seriously,as it just might be right.I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts.In part one,I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning resultsand to highlight a profound mysterywhich those results revealed.In part two,I'll offer a solution to that mystery.It's based on an approach called string theory,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.664}, {"text": "and that's where the idea of the multiversewill come into the story.Finally, in part three,I'm going to describe a cosmological theorycalled inflation,which will pull all the pieces of the story together.Okay, part one starts back in 1929when the great astronomer Edwin Hubblerealized that the distant galaxieswere all rushing away from us,establishing that space itself is stretching,it's expanding.Now this was revolutionary.The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scalesthe universe was static.But even so,there was one thing that everyone was certain of:The expansion must be slowing down.That, much as the gravitational pull of the Earthslows the ascent of an apple tossed upward,the gravitational pullof each galaxy on every othermust be slowingthe expansion of space.Now let's fast-forward to the 1990swhen those two teams of astronomersI mentioned at the outsetwere inspired by this reasoningto measure the rateat which the expansion has been slowing.And they did thisby painstaking observationsof numerous distant galaxies,allowing them to charthow the expansion rate has changed over time.Here's the surprise:They found that the expansion is not slowing down.Instead they found that it's speeding up,going faster and faster.That's like tossing an apple upwardand it goes up faster and faster.Now if you saw an apple do that,you'd want to know why.What's pushing on it?Similarly, the astronomers' resultsare surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize,but they raised an analogous question.What force is driving all galaxiesto rush away from every otherat an ever-quickening speed?Well the most promising answer", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.187}, {"text": "comes from an old idea of Einstein's.You see, we are all used to gravitybeing a force that does one thing,pulls objects together.But in Einstein's theory of gravity,his general theory of relativity,gravity can also push things apart.How? Well according to Einstein's math,if space is uniformly filledwith an invisible energy,sort of like a uniform, invisible mist,then the gravity generated by that mistwould be repulsive,repulsive gravity,which is just what we need to explain the observations.Because the repulsive gravityof an invisible energy in space --we now call it dark energy,but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it --its repulsive gravitywould cause each galaxy to push against every other,driving expansion to speed up,not slow down.And this explanationrepresents great progress.But I promised you a mysteryhere in part one.Here it is.When the astronomers worked outhow much of this dark energymust be infusing spaceto account for the cosmic speed up,look at what they found.This number is small.Expressed in the relevant unit,it is spectacularly small.And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number.We want this numberto emerge from the laws of physics,but so far no one has found a way to do that.Now you might wonder,should you care?Maybe explaining this numberis just a technical issue,a technical detail of interest to experts,but of no relevance to anybody else.Well it surely is a technical detail,but some details really matter.Some details provide", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.159}, {"text": "windows into uncharted realms of reality,and this peculiar number may be doing just that,as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain itinvokes the possibility of other universes --an idea that naturally emerges from string theory,which takes me to part two: string theory.So hold the mystery of the dark energyin the back of your mindas I now go on to tell youthree key things about string theory.First off, what is it?Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dreamof a unified theory of physics,a single overarching frameworkthat would be able to describeall the forces at work in the universe.And the central idea of string theoryis quite straightforward.It says that if you examineany piece of matter ever more finely,at first you'll find moleculesand then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles.But the theory says that if you could probe smaller,much smaller than we can with existing technology,you'd find something else inside these particles --a little tiny vibrating filament of energy,a little tiny vibrating string.And just like the strings on a violin,they can vibrate in different patternsproducing different musical notes.These little fundamental strings,when they vibrate in different patterns,they produce different kinds of particles --so electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons,all other particleswould be united into a single framework,as they would all arise from vibrating strings.It's a compelling picture,a kind of cosmic symphony,where all the richnessthat we see in the world around usemerges from the musicthat these little, tiny strings can play.But there's a costto this elegant unification,because years of researchhave shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work.It has internal inconsistencies,unless we allowfor something wholly unfamiliar --", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.119}, {"text": "extra dimensions of space.That is, we all know about the usual three dimensions of space.And you can think about thoseas height, width and depth.But string theory says that, on fantastically small scales,there are additional dimensionscrumpled to a tiny size so smallthat we have not detected them.But even though the dimensions are hidden,they would have an impact on things that we can observebecause the shape of the extra dimensionsconstrains how the strings can vibrate.And in string theory,vibration determines everything.So particle masses, the strengths of forces,and most importantly, the amount of dark energywould be determinedby the shape of the extra dimensions.So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions,we should be able to calculate these features,calculate the amount of dark energy.The challengeis we don't knowthe shape of the extra dimensions.All we haveis a list of candidate shapesallowed by the math.Now when these ideas were first developed,there were only about five different candidate shapes,so you can imagineanalyzing them one-by-oneto determine if any yieldthe physical features we observe.But over time the list grewas researchers found other candidate shapes.From five, the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands --A large, but still manageable, collection to analyze,since after all,graduate students need something to do.But then the list continued to growinto the millions and the billions, until today.The list of candidate shapeshas soared to about 10 to the 500.So, what to do?Well some researchers lost heart,concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions,each giving rise to different physical features,", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "string theory would never makedefinitive, testable predictions.But others turned this issue on its head,taking us to the possibility of a multiverse.Here's the idea.Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other.Each is as real as every other,in the sensethat there are many universes,each with a different shape, for the extra dimensions.And this radical proposalhas a profound impact on this mystery:the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results.Because you see,if there are other universes,and if those universeseach have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions,then the physical features of each universe will be different,and in particular,the amount of dark energy in each universewill be different.Which means that the mysteryof explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measuredwould take on a wholly different character.In this context,the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energybecause there isn't just one number,there are many numbers.Which meanswe have been asking the wrong question.It's that the right question to ask is,why do we humans find ourselves in a universewith a particular amount of dark energy we've measuredinstead of any of the other possibilitiesthat are out there?And that's a question on which we can make headway.Because those universesthat have much more dark energy than ours,whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies,the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strongthat it blows the clump apartand galaxies don't form.And in those universes that have much less dark energy,well they collapse back on themselves so quicklythat, again, galaxies don't form.And without galaxies, there are no stars, no planetsand no chancefor our form of lifeto exist in those other universes.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So we find ourselves in a universewith the particular amount of dark energy we've measuredsimply because our universe has conditionshospitable to our form of life.And that would be that.Mystery solved,multiverse found.Now some find this explanation unsatisfying.We're used to physicsgiving us definitive explanations for the features we observe.But the point is,if the feature you're observingcan and does take ona wide variety of different valuesacross the wider landscape of reality,then thinking one explanationfor a particular valueis simply misguided.An early examplecomes from the great astronomer Johannes Keplerwho was obsessed with understandinga different number --why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth.And he worked for decades trying to explain this number,but he never succeeded, and we know why.Kepler was askingthe wrong question.We now know that there are many planetsat a wide variety of different distances from their host stars.So hoping that the laws of physicswill explain one particular number, 93 million miles,well that is simply wrongheaded.Instead the right question to ask is,why do we humans find ourselves on a planetat this particular distance,instead of any of the other possibilities?And again, that's a question we can answer.Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sunwould be so hotthat our form of life wouldn't exist.And those planets that are much farther away from the star,well they're so coldthat, again, our form of life would not take hold.So we find ourselveson a planet at this particular distancesimply because it yields conditionsvital to our form of life.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And when it comes to planets and their distances,this clearly is the right kind of reasoning.The point is,when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain,it may also be the right kind of reasoning.One key difference, of course,is we know that there are other planets out there,but so far I've only speculated on the possibilitythat there might be other universes.So to pull it all together,we need a mechanismthat can actually generate other universes.And that takes me to my final part, part three.Because such a mechanism has been foundby cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang.You see, when we speak of the Big Bang,we often have an imageof a kind of cosmic explosionthat created our universeand set space rushing outward.But there's a little secret.The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important,the Bang.It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang,but gives us no insightinto what would have powered the Bang itself.And this gap was finally filledby an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.It's called inflationary cosmology,which identified a particular kind of fuelthat would naturally generatean outward rush of space.The fuel is based on something called a quantum field,but the only detail that matters for usis that this fuel proves to be so efficientthat it's virtually impossibleto use it all up,which means in the inflationary theory,the Big Bang giving rise to our universeis likely not a one-time event.Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang,but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs,each giving rise to its own separate universewith our universe becoming but one bubble", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.102}, {"text": "in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes.And now, when we meld this with string theory,here's the picture we're led to.Each of these universes has extra dimensions.The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes.The different shapes yield different physical features.And we find ourselves in one universe instead of anothersimply because it's only in our universethat the physical features, like the amount of dark energy,are right for our form of life to take hold.And this is the compelling but highly controversial pictureof the wider cosmosthat cutting-edge observation and theoryhave now led us to seriously consider.One big remaining question, of course, is,could we ever confirmthe existence of other universes?Well let me describeone way that might one day happen.The inflationary theoryalready has strong observational support.Because the theory predictsthat the Big Bang would have been so intensethat as space rapidly expanded,tiny quantum jitters from the micro worldwould have been stretched out to the macro world,yielding a distinctive fingerprint,a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots,across space,which powerful telescopes have now observed.Going further, if there are other universes,the theory predicts that every so oftenthose universes can collide.And if our universe got hit by another,that collisionwould generate an additional subtle patternof temperature variations across spacethat we might one daybe able to detect.And so exotic as this picture is,it may one day be groundedin observations,establishing the existence of other universes.I'll concludewith a striking implicationof all these ideasfor the very far future.You see, we learned", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.177}, {"text": "that our universe is not static,that space is expanding,that that expansion is speeding upand that there might be other universesall by carefully examiningfaint pinpoints of starlightcoming to us from distant galaxies.But because the expansion is speeding up,in the very far future,those galaxies will rush away so far and so fastthat we won't be able to see them --not because of technological limitations,but because of the laws of physics.The light those galaxies emit,even traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light,will not be able to overcomethe ever-widening gulf between us.So astronomers in the far futurelooking out into deep spacewill see nothing but an endless stretchof static, inky, black stillness.And they will concludethat the universe is static and unchangingand populated by a single central oasis of matterthat they inhabit --a picture of the cosmosthat we definitively know to be wrong.Now maybe those future astronomers will have recordshanded down from an earlier era,like ours,attesting to an expanding cosmosteeming with galaxies.But would those future astronomersbelieve such ancient knowledge?Or would they believein the black, static empty universethat their own state-of-the-art observations reveal?I suspect the latter.Which means that we are livingthrough a remarkably privileged erawhen certain deep truths about the cosmosare still within reachof the human spirit of exploration.It appears that it may not always be that way.Because today's astronomers,by turning powerful telescopes to the sky,have captured a handful of starkly informative photons --a kind of cosmic telegrambillions of years in transit.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and the message echoing across the ages is clear.Sometimes

you.The range of ideas you've just spoken aboutare dizzying, exhilarating, incredible.How do you thinkof where cosmology is now,in a sort of historical side?Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion?BG: Well it's hard to say.When we learn that astronomers of the far futuremay not have enough information to figure things out,the natural question is, maybe we're already in that positionand certain deep, critical features of the universealready have escaped our ability to understandbecause of how cosmology evolves.So from that perspective,maybe we will always be asking questionsand never be able to fully answer them.On the other hand, we now can understandhow old the universe is.We can understandhow to understand the data from the microwave background radiationthat was set down 13.72 billion years ago --and yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will lookand it matches.Holy cow! That's just amazing.So on the one hand, it's just incredible where we've gotten,but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future.CA: You're going to be around for the next few days.Maybe some of these conversations can continue.Thank you.
