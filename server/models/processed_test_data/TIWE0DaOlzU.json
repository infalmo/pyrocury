So actually, it's not aterrible assumption for us to\nwork with if we think abouttypical consumers.In practice, savings is going\nto turn out to be a verycritical part of what we're\ngoing to do to think abouteconomics, so we'll\ncome back to that.But we're going to ignore\nsavings for now and assumethat your budget equals\nyour income.So let's say that your parents,\nprobably a good model", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.404}, {"text": "is you guys, you guys probably\naren't in saving mode.You've got some budget saved\nfrom your parents.Let's call it y.And let's say that your parents\ngive you some budgetat the start of the semester,\ny, and they say this is yourmoney you have to spend,\nsay each month orfor the whole semester.And let's imagine that you have\nto allocate that budgetonly across two goods,\npizza and movies.So once again, unrealistic,\nbut this is the kind ofsimplifying assumption that lets\nus understand how peoplemake decisions.So that gives you your\nbudget constraint.You've got some income y that\nyour parents have given you,and you can allocate that\nacross pizza and movies.So how do you allocate that?Well, you can buy movies, the\nnumber of movies you can get,plus the number of pizzas.Well, how many of each\nyou can get, thatdepends on their price.In particular, budget constraint\nis the number ofmovies times the price\nper movie plus thenumber of pizzas --plus the number of pizzas times\nthe price for pizza.That's your budget constraint.It's the number of movies times\nthe price per movie orthe number of pizzas times\nthe price for pizza.And this is easiest to\nsee graphically.If you go to figure 5-1, this is\na graphical illustration ofa budget constraint.Now, let's just carefully talk\nthrough this for a moment.You're going to be really good\nat dealing with budgetconstraints.You're going to have to\nbe this semester.So let's carefully talk about\nwhere this comes from.OK, the x-axis is going to be\nhow many movies you could haveif all you did with your income\nwas consume movies.Well, if all you did with your\nincome was consume movies, youcould have y over\np sub m movies.If you decided to devote your\nincome solely to movies, thenyou could have y times y\nover p sub m movies.If instead you decided to devote\nall your income to", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.266}, {"text": "pizza, then you could have\ny over p sub p pizza.So the y-axis is going to be\nthe point where you consumezero movies and all pizza.It's going to be where\nyou devote yourentire budget to pizzas.And then there'll be some\ncombination in between, whichis our budget line.Which is the combinations of\npizzas and movies you canconsume given your\ntotal income y.And the slope of that line is\ngoing to be the price ratio.Or the negative of\nthe price ratio.The slope of that line is going\nto be minus pp over pm.The slope of that line is going\nto be the change in theratio of the price of pizza\nto the price of movies.OK, what am I doing\nwrong here?Negative of the price ratio.Have I got this right?Rise over run.Yeah.Have I got this right?Yeah.AUDIENCE: I think that the pp\nand the pm's are in thedenominators, because it's y\nover pp [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].PROFESSOR: Right.It's the denominators, that's\nwhat I did wrong.Right, so it is pm over pp.Sorry, my bad.OK, right.Because they're the\ndenominators.Because it's the rise over run\nin terms of the quantity.So that's what I did wrong.OK, so basically it's the\nnegative of the price ratio,minus the price of movies over\nthe price of pizzas becausethey're in the denominators as\nyou said, because as the pricegoes up, the quantity\ngoes down.So the negative of the price\nratio of the price of movies", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.225}, {"text": "to the price of pizzas\nis the slope.So let's just do a\nsimple example.Imagine that income\nequals $96.Imagine your parents\ngive you $96, saya month or a semester.Imagine that the price of movies\nis $8 and imagine theprice of a pizza is $16.It's a good pizza.So what this means is that with\nyour income of $96, youcould either get eight\npizzas or 12 movies.So that means that the price\nratio of the slope of yourbudget constraint\nis minus 1/2.The price ratio is minus 1/2.So the slope of that budget\nconstraint is minus 1/2.Now, we have a name\nfor this slope.We're going to call this\nthe marginal rate oftransformation.The marginal rate of\ntransformation is our labelfor this slope.Now, why do we use that name?Well, it means that's the\nmarginal rate at which you cantransform pizzas into movies.The rate at which you can\nturn pizzas into movies.Now, once again, like I talked\nabout last time, you're not analchemist. You're not actually\nturning pizzas into movies.But the market essentially is\ngiving you a rate at which youcan do that given a budget,\ngiven that you have a certainamount of money.Given that you have a certain\namount of money, $96, andgiven the prices that you face\nin the market, you couldtransform pizzas into movies\nby trading onepizza for 1/2 a movie.Now, once again, you're not\nactually doing the physicaltransformation, but that's the\ntrade-off that you face whenyou're trying to transform\none to the other.So effectively, it's the same as\nif you're trading them for", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.211}, {"text": "each other.As I talked about last time.it's essentially the same as\nyou're trading, and that'sbecause of the key economic\nconcept we'll come back toover and over again\nin this course--the concept of opportunity\ncost.The opportunity cost is the\nvalue of the forgonealternative.The value of the forgone\nalternative is the opportunitycost. So basically what that\nmeans is if you decide toforgo a pizza, that's the same\nas forgoing two movies.Likewise, if you decide to forgo\na movie, it's the sameas forgoing half a pizza.So the opportunity cost of a\nmovie, what essentially themovie is costing you,\nis 1/2 a pizza.Now, really it's costing you $8\nand a pizza costs you $16.But when we think about\ntrading off goods, theopportunity cost of that movie\nis that you've forgone theability to eat half a pizza.That's the opportunity cost\nof the situation.So that's basically\nhow we're going tothink about this trade-off.We're going to think about\ntrading off goods as theopportunity cost of consuming\none good instead of another.The opportunity cost of that\nmovie is that you haven'tgotten to eat 1/2 a pizza.The opportunity cost of the\npizza is that you've forgoneseeing two movies.And the reason is because\nyou have a fixed budget.If you had an infinite budget,\nthere'd be no opportunitycost.

constraint.Let's imagine the price of\npizzas rose from $16 to $24.Pizzas got really expensive.We decided we only want gourmet\npizzas or something.The price of pizzas went\nfrom $16 to $24.What does this do?Well, let's look\nat figure 5-2.It'll show what that does.What that does is it says our\nnew budget constraint, insteadof being 16p plus 8m equals 96,\nwhich is what the budgetconstraint was in our example,\nit's now 24pplus 8m equals 96.That's the new equation for\nthe budget constraint.Or, more relevantly, the slope\nof the budget constraint hasflattened from minus\n1/2 to minus 1/3.The slope has fallen from\nminus 1/2 to minus 1/3.The price ratio has been reduced\nfrom 1/2 to 1/3.Now, forget utility\nfor a second.Forget the fact that we\nthought about utility.Just looking at this,

parentshave cut you off.They still give you the $96.But you're effectively poorer.You're effectively worse\noff, and why is that?Because the set of things you\ncould afford with that $96 hasjust been restricted.And unless you truly have no\nvalue on pizza, unless all youcare about's the movie--you're gluten and cheese\nallergic or something, youhave no value on pizza--then you're worse off.Your opportunity set's\nrestricted.And that's the key insight here,\nis that you are worseoff because the price\nhas increased.A price increase makes\nyou worse off.It restricts your opportunity\nset, because with the sameamount of income, you can\nnow afford fewer goods.Your opportunity set has\nbeen restricted.Likewise, now let's talk\nabout what happenswhen your income falls.That's the next

indifference\ncurve you can achieve?Because remember,\nmore is better.Indifference curves that are\nfurther out make you happier.So what's the furthest out\nindifference curve that youcan achieve

the\nmarginal utilities.In particular, it's the negative\nof the marginalutility of movies over the\nmarginal utility of pizza.Remember, it's the negative of\nthe marginal utility of thex-axis over the marginal\nutility of the y-axis.So marginal rate of substitution\nis the rate atwhich you're willing to\nsubstitute between movies andpizza, which is a function of\nyour marginal utilities.If your marginal utility for\nmovies is very high, then youneed a lot of pizzas.Then you wouldn't trade a movie\nunless you get a lot ofpizza for it.If your marginal utility of\nmovies is very low, you'd behappy to give up a movie\neven for a smallfraction of a pizza.So that's the marginal\nrate of substitution.That's about preferences only.At the same time, we're saying\nthat that marginal rate

constant.But the marginal utilities\nare not constant.Marginal utilities are obviously\nchanging the moremoves you see.Once again, with intuition,\nyou have todevelop your own intuition.The way that I like to think\nabout this intuitively is toactually rewrite this a little\nbit, and rewrite it as sayingthat the marginal utility of\nmovies over the price ofmovies equals the marginal\nutility of pizza over theprice of pizza.At the optimum, this'll\nbe true.I like this because to me this\nterm sort of says, look, thebang for the buck has to be\nthe same across all goods.For each dollar of movie\nexpenditure, what's it buying?What's that next dollar of movie\nexpenditure buying you?This is saying, what's that\nnext dollar of pizzaexpenditure buying you?And they've got to be equal.If the

Well,at point B, if you do the math\nand work it out, you see thatthe marginal utility of\npizza is five oversquare root of ten.The marginal utility of\nmovies is 0.5 over thesquare root of 10.So the MRS is 0.1.At this point, you'd only be\nwilling to give up 0.1 pizzasto see a movie.At a point like B,\nthe indifferencecurve is very flat.You're only willing to give up\n0.1 pizzas to see a movie.But remember, the market is\nwilling to say, look--you can flip it around, the\nmarket's willing to say, look,you can get a movie.You're only willing to give up\n0.1 pizzas to see a movie.Well, that means clearly that\nyou have too many movies and", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.32}, {"text": "not enough pizza.You're clearly at that point\nhappy to say, wow, you meanthat I can gain a whole pizza by\njust giving up two movies?Heck, I'd be willing to give up\n10 movies to get a pizza.At the point I'm at right there,\nI'd be willing to giveup 10 movies to get a pizza.You're telling me we only\nhave to give up twomovies to get a pizza?Great.I'm going to do that trade.I'm going to move back towards\npoint D.

pizza\neffectively from $16 a pizzato $24 because instead of paying\nyour $16, you're alsogoing to pay $8 to the\ngovernment in tax.So what's that going to do?That is going to, in general,\nlower

think about this isthe government can't affect\nyour preferences.But in fact, if people do\nmental accounting, thegovernment maybe can affect\nyour preferences.So let's say that basically the\nway I
