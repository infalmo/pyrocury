[{"text": "SARAH HANSEN: Well, you have a\nlot of followers of your 18.06videos.GILBERT STRANG:\nThat's wonderful.SARAH HANSEN: And I'll\nread this quote to you.\"A commenter even noted\nthat this is not lecture,this is art.\"GILBERT STRANG: Gosh.OK.Well, if you're going to ask\nwhat's my system, I have none.I guess-- well, first\nI like students.And I want to help.And maybe the key point\nis to think with them.Not to just say, OK, here\nit is, listen, listen up.I think through the question\nall over again as they do.And you have to give time.You can't zip through a proof.Because this class has to be\nsort of thinking with you.And that's-- yeah,\nthat's my thought.I don't know if I achieve it,\nbut I think it's the goal.SARAH HANSEN: One\nof our users on OCWnoted that during\nlectures you sometimes askrhetorical questions, or maybe\nfeign confusion as a way--GILBERT STRANG: Feign confusion?I'm confused.SARAH HANSEN: Are you?OK.GILBERT STRANG: Well, no.Well, no, it's probably true.That's maybe part of\nnot rushing through it.But getting-- so I'll pause\nat the critical point, maybe.You have to give time to see,\nOK, what's the next step?You know, mathematics\nis

times.First maybe on the\nboard as symbols.But not everybody\npicks up on symbols.Then you say, what does it mean?And then finally you\nsay, why is it true?But you don't say,\n\"Why is it true?Give the proof,\"\nthe very first step.You want to make people\nthink, yeah, it is true.SARAH HANSEN: Others have noted\nthat you do this thing whereyou display your own\nthinking kind of on the spotas you work through problems.GILBERT STRANG: Yeah.SARAH HANSEN: Is there ever\na risk in that for you?GILBERT STRANG: Oh, yes.And it happens, that\nI lose the threador I come up to a dead\nend where I don't knowwhat I'm supposed to do next.But generally, especially in\n18.06, The basic linear algebracourse that many\npeople have watched,there I kind of get it OK.Yeah, I've taught\nit enough timesto have a good chance\nof getting it right.SARAH HANSEN: Is this a strategy\nthat you developed over time?You know, lots of people\nare nervous to do that,to make themselves vulnerable\nin front of a large lectureclass like that.But you're working\nproblems in real timeand demonstrating what happens\nwhen you hit a dead end.GILBERT STRANG: Well,\nthat's OK, because studentsare going to hit dead ends, so\nit seems to me it's OK for meto get stuck, too.And then if they see,\noh, OK, maybe thisis the way to get\nout of that corner.Yeah.So essentially I think the\nthing is I like students.", "start":

been knownto say things like, keep things\nin their Gauss-given order.GILBERT STRANG: I see.SARAH HANSEN: And other really\nfunny things that peoplejust love.So what's the role of\nhumor in your teaching?GILBERT STRANG:\nWell, maybe it's--which is what I'm saying\nhere, maybe the key pointis to make it human.You know, you're a person,\nlike the student is a person.The book isn't quite a person,\nbut it was written by a person.And to see that it's just\nlike a natural thing to do.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.SARAH HANSEN: So\none of our userswas thinking about how you\nteach complex material, howyou convey it in ways that\nare comfortable for students.And the user was\nwondering, how doyou know when to go into\ndetail and when not to?GILBERT STRANG: I suppose I try\nto think it through once again.And then you sort\nof automaticallysee the word-- you recognize\nwhat words you need to use,and what the steps are.Yeah.If you're not\nthinking it yourself,then you're probably\ngoing too fastand not connecting with\nthe thinking of the class.SARAH HANSEN: And\nhow do you connectwith the thinking of the class\nwhen it's such a large lecturehall?And everyone's at a different\npoint in

What\nelse would youlike to add about teaching\n18.06 linear algebra?GILBERT STRANG: Well, with\n18.06 of course, I'm just--so, recently, Open\nCourseWare, which I thinkwas just such a great idea.Great idea for MIT.Great idea for faculty.So they did a count of the\nnumber of viewers in 18.06,and it was 10 million.Which was like, woo.I never expected.But I do get nice,\nreally nice messagesfrom all over the world.And I reply to\nthem far as I can.Sometimes they'll ask what's\na good way to learn math?I don't know if I have\nan answer to that.But anyway, I try\nto be encouraging.So yeah.It's been wonderful.Just having the video\nlectures availableallows everybody\nto be in the class.Yeah.So, thank you all for\njoining the class.Thank you.", "start": 360.0, "heat":
