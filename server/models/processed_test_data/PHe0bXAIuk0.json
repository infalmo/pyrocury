That's a transaction.It is the building block \nof the economic machine.All cycles and all forces \nin an economy are driven by transactions.So, if we can \nunderstand transactions,we can understand \nthe whole economy.A market consists of all the buyersand all the sellersmaking transactions for the same thing.For example, \nthere is a wheat market,a car market,a stock marketand markets \nfor millions of things.An economy consists \nof all of the transactionsin all of its markets.If you add up \nthe total spendingand the total \nquantity soldin all of the markets,you have everything \nyou need to knowto understand the economy.It's just that simple.People, businesses, banks and governmentsall engage in transactions \nthe way I just described:exchanging money and credit \nfor goods, services and financial assets.The biggest buyer and seller \nis the government,which consists of two important parts:a Central Government \nthat collects taxes and spends money......and a Central Bank,which is different from other buyers \nand sellers because itcontrols the amount of money \nand credit in the economy.It does this by influencing \ninterest ratesand printing new money.For these reasons, \nas we'll see,the Central Bank is an \nimportant player in the flowof Credit.I want you to \npay attention to credit.Credit is the most \nimportant part of the economy,and probably the least understood.It is the most important part \nbecause it is the biggestand most volatile part.Just like buyers and sellers \ngo to the market to make transactions,so do lenders and borrowers.Lenders usually want to \nmake their money into more moneyand borrowers usually want to \nbuy something they can't afford,like a house or caror they want to invest in \nsomething like starting a business.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Credit can help both lendersand borrowers get what they want.Borrowers promise to \nrepay the amount they borrow,called the principal,plus an additional amount, called interest.When interest rates are high,there is less borrowing \nbecause it's expensive.When interest rates are low,borrowing increases \nbecause it's cheaper.When borrowers promise to repayand lenders believe them,credit is created.Any two people can agree \nto create credit out of thin air!That seems simple enough \nbut credit is trickybecause it has different names.As soon as credit is created,it immediately turns into debt.Debt is both an asset to the lender,and a liability to the borrower.In the future,when the borrower repays the loan, \nplus interest,the asset and liability disappearand the transaction is settled.So, why is credit so important?Because when a borrower receives credit,he is able to increase his spending.And remember, \nspending drives the economy.This is because one person's spendingis another person's income.Think about it, \nevery dollar you spend, someone else earns.and every dollar you earn, \nsomeone else has spent.So when you spend more, \nsomeone else earns more.When someone's income risesit makes lenders more willing \nto lend him moneybecause now he's \nmore worthy of credit.A creditworthy borrower \nhas two things:the ability to repay and collateral.Having a lot of income in relation to his debt gives him the ability to repay.In the event that he can't repay, he has valuable assets to use as collateral that can be sold.This makes lenders feel comfortable lending him money.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.124}, {"text": "So increased income allows increased borrowingwhich allows increased spending.And since one person's spending is another person's income,this leads to more increased borrowing and so on.This self-reinforcing pattern leads to economic growthand is why we have Cycles.In a transaction, you have to give something in order to get somethingand how much you get depends on how much\nyou produceover time we learnedand that accumulated knowledge raises\nare living standardswe call this productivity growththose who were invented and hard-working raisetheir productivity and their living\nstandards fasterthan those who are complacent and lazy,but that isn't necessarily true over the short run.Productivity matters most in the long run, but credit matters most in the short run.This is because productivity growth doesn't fluctuate much,so it's not a big driver of economic swings.Debt is \u2014 because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire itand it forces us to consume less than we produce when we pay it back.Debt swings occur in two big cycles.One takes about 5 to 8 years and the other takes about 75 to 100 years.While most people feel the swings, they typically don't see them as cyclesbecause they see them too up close -- day by day, week by week.In this chapter we are going to step back and look at these three big forcesand how they interact to make up our experiences.As mentioned, swings around the line are not due to how much innovation or hard work there is,they're primarily due to how much credit there is.Let's for a second imagine an economy without credit.In this economy, the only way I can increase my spendingis to increase my income,which requires me to be more productive and do more work.Increased productivity is the only way for growth.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.148}, {"text": "Since my spending is another person's income,the economy grows every time I or anyone else is more productive.If we follow the transactions and play this out,we see a progression like the productivity growth line.But because we borrow, we have cycles.This isn't due to any laws or regulation,it's due to human nature and the way that credit works.Think of borrowing as simply a way of pulling spending forward.In order to buy something you can't afford, you need to spend more than you make.To do this, you essentially need to borrow from your future self.In doing so you create a time in the futurethat you need to spend less than you make in order to pay it back.It very quickly resembles a cycle.Basically, anytime you borrow you create a cycle.?This is as true for an individual as it is for the economy.This is why understanding credit is so importantbecause it sets into motiona mechanical, predictable series of events that will happen in the future.This makes credit different from money.Money is what you settle transactions with.When you buy a beer from a bartender with cash,the transaction is settled immediately.But when you buy a beer with credit,it's like starting a bar tab.You're saying you promise to pay in the future.Together you and the bartender create an asset and a liability.You just created credit.  Out of thin air.It's not until you pay the bar tab laterthat the asset and liability disappear,the debt goes awayand the transaction is settled.The reality is that most of what people call money is actually credit.The total amount of credit in the United States is about $50 trillionand the total amount of money is only about $3 trillion.Remember, in an economy without credit:", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.134}, {"text": "the only way to increase your spending is to produce more.But in an economy with credit,you can also increase your spending by borrowing.As a result, an economy with credit has more spendingand allows incomes to rise faster than productivity over the short run,but not over the long run.Now, don't get me wrong,credit isn't necessarily something bad that just causes cycles.It's bad when it finances over-consumption that can't be paid back.However, it's good when it efficiently allocates resourcesand produces income so you can pay back the debt.For example, if you borrow money to buy a big TV,it doesn't generate income \nfor you to pay back the debt.But, if you borrow money \nto buy a tractor \u2014and that tractor let's you harvest \nmore crops and earn more money\u2014 then, you can pay back your debtand improve your living standards.In an economy with credit,we can follow the transactionsand see how credit creates growth.Let me give you an example:Suppose you earn $100,000 a year and have no debt.You are creditworthy enough to borrow $10,000 dollars- say on a credit card- so you can spend $110,000 dollarseven though you only earn $100,000 dollars.Since your spending is another person's income,someone is earning $110,000 dollars.The person earning $110,000 dollarswith no debt can borrow $11,000 dollars,so he can spend $121,000 dollarseven though he has only earned $110,000 dollars.His spending is another person's incomeand by following the transactionswe can begin to see how this processworks in a self-reinforcing pattern.But remember, borrowing creates cyclesand if the cycle goes up, it eventually needs to come down.This leads us into the Short Term Debt Cycle.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.343}, {"text": "As economic activity increases, we see an expansion- the first phase of the short term debt cycle.Spending continues to increase and prices start to rise.This happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit- which can be created instantly out of thin air.When the amount of spending and incomes grow faster than the production of goods:prices rise.When prices rise, we call this inflation.The Central Bank doesn't want too much inflationbecause it causes problems.Seeing prices rise, it raises interest rates.With higher interest rates, fewer people can afford to borrow money.And the cost of existing debts rises.Think about this as the monthly payments \non your credit card going up.Because people borrow less and have higher debt repayments,they have less money leftover to spend, so spending slows...and since one person's spending is another person's income,incomes drop...and so on and so forth.When people spend less, prices go down.We call this deflation.Economic activity decreases and we have a recession.If the recession becomes too severeand inflation is no longer a problem,the central bank will lower interest rates to cause everything to pick up again.With low interest rates,debt repayments are reducedand borrowing and spending pick upand we see another expansion.As you can see, the economy works like a machine.In the short term debt cycle, \nspending is constrained only by the willingness oflenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit.When credit is easily available, \nthere's an economic expansion.When credit isn't easily available, \nthere's a recession.And note that this cycle is controlled primarily by the central bank.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.352}, {"text": "The short term debt cycle typically lasts 5 -

so the stimulation ends.Interest rates in the United States hit 0% during the deleveraging ofthe 1930sand again in 2008.The difference between a recessionand a deleveraging is that in a deleveraging borrowers' debt burdens havesimply gotten too bigand can't be relieved by lowering interest rates.Lenders realize that debts have become too large to ever be fully paid back.Borrowers have lost their ability to repay and their collateral has lost value.They feel crippled by the debt -

Unlike cutting spending,debt reduction, and wealth redistribution,printing money is inflationary and stimulative. Inevitably, the central bankprints new money\u2014 out of thin air \u2014 and uses it to buy financial assetsand government bonds.

Basically,income needs to grow faster than debt grows. For example:let's assume that a country going through a deleveraging has a debt-to-income ratio of 100%.That means that the amount of debt it has is the same as the amount of income the", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.141}, {"text": "entire country makes in a year.Now think about the interest rate on that debt,let's say it is 2%.If debt is growing at 2% because of that interest rate andincomeis only growing at around only 1%, you will never reduce the debt burden.You need to print enough money to get the rate of income growth above therate of interest.However, printing money can easily be abused because it's so easy to do andpeople prefer it to the alternatives.The key is to avoid printing too much moneyand causing unacceptably high inflation, the way Germany did during itsdeleveraging in the 1920's.If policymakers achieve the right balance, a deleveraging isn't so dramatic.Growth is slow but debt burdens go down.That's a beautiful deleveraging.When incomes begin to rise, borrowers begin to appear more creditworthy.And when borrowers appear more creditworthy,lenders begin to lend money again. \nDebt burdens finally begin to fall.Able to borrow money, people can spend more. Eventually, the economy begins togrow again,leading to the reflation phase of the long term debt cycle.Though the deleveraging process can be horrible if handled badly,if handled well, it will eventually fix the problem.It takes roughly a decade or morefor debt burdens to fall and economic activity to get back to normal- hence the term 'lost decade.'Of course, the economy is a little more complicated than this templatesuggests.However, laying the short term debt cycle on top of the long term debt cycleand then laying both of them on top of the productivity growth linegives a reasonably good template for seeing where we've been,where we are now and where we are probably headed.So in summary, there are three rules of thumb that I'd like you to take away", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.227}, {"text": "from this:First: \nDon't have debt rise faster than income,because your debt burdens will eventually crush you.Second: \nDon't have income rise faster than productivity,because you will eventually become uncompetitive.And third: \nDo all that you can to raise your productivity,because, in the long run, that's what matters most.This is simple advice for you and it's simple advice for policy makers.You might be surprised but most people \u2014 including most policy makers \u2014 don't pay enough attentionto this.This template has worked for me and I hope that it'll work for you.Thank you.", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.142}]
