course.Now that we've done a little\nof the basics, a little bitof the economics, and\nnow it's some use casesthrough the lens of finance.And to say something\nabout one, whyI thought it'd be worthwhile to\nstructure the course this way,and what I'm hoping\nwe all get outof these next 10\nor 11 lectures isthat I thought that it\nwas important after layingsome foundation of what\nblockchain technology mightor might not be, and\ncryptocurrencies,and of course, talking\nabout the economics,is to use one field that's the\nmost dominant field right nowabout potential\nblockchain technologyuse, which is finance.It's not the only\narea, but finance iscompletely reliant on ledgers.It's completely reliant\non moving property rightsaround multiple parties.And of course,\nthe first use casewas about Bitcoin, which\nwas a peer-to-peer money.So I thought even\nif you're thinkingabout this in terms\nof health care,thinking about it terms\nof the internet of things,et cetera, many, many other use\ncases, why not take finance.Now it also happens to be\nmy comparative background.And I've spent the last three\nor four decades of my lifearound finance.And so I can be most\nhelpful

last\nweekend was reallya joy reading 50-plus papers\nthat it was only about 25of you that had decided to hand\nin papers early in classes 2through 9.But class 10 was 50-plus of you.So I really do have\na sense of the classin terms of what you think\nabout finance and blockchain.Of course, you'll\nprobably do the same.I think I might design it\ndifferently the next time.But if you all hand in--if 50 or 60 of you hand in\nthe papers for class 23,it will be--and you have that right.I'm not taking that\naway from any of you.But it means I might be delayed\ngetting back all the projects.I want to say two or three\nother things overall.In terms of where we are, we're\nhalfway through the semester.And Sabrina and\nThalita and I dida good job of just\nsaying, how are wedoing on class

bell-shaped curve.Some, on the other hand--not many-- kind of\nmissed the mark.So I just want to say\na couple of things.One is, it's not about just\nanswering the three studyquestions.The study questions are really\nto spur the dialogue here.There's three questions.Not many of you, but two or\nthree people just sort of justtried to answer those.Think about it as a\nuniform three-page paper.Five is the limit.One or two of you that\ndid six or seven pages.That's fine, but it's just--you don't need to, and it's\nmore work, in a sense, for us.Two is, I really did try to\ngive feedback and comments.And overall what we're\ntrying to get to is,what are the economics here?What is there about append-only\nlogs and consensus protocolsamongst multiple parties\nwriting to a shared ledger?So multiple parties\nupdating some stateof economic-- an\neconomic state, really--of property rights or something.And what verification costs,\nwhat networking costs,could be lowered.And it's unfair,\nbecause all of youare going to try to figure\nout a final project together.And I went back over the weekend\nlooking at the final projects.I think there's some really neat\nideas that you're

a little bit of\nhistory all together.And that's when you're\ngoing to meet Alin.Not computer science\nAlin, but payment Alin.And we're going to talk\nabout mobile payments, whichis a very

sort\nof a similar thingcoming both from central banks\nand from the private sector.I just came from a meeting where\none of Larry's colleagues--he's from the Harvard\nBusiness School--a professor at

side is\nclearing and settlement.I mean, why is the\nAustralian stock exchangeusing a permissioned system?Might you use something else?Why is the international\nswap and dealer associationusing smart

trade\nfinance, digital ID.I know at least one\ngroup is doing some--one of the groups here is\ndoing something on digital ID.So you'll be out ahead of us.So that's kind of a\nreview of H2 for us.So

about some of\nthe major trends in payments?I don't know how sleepy\neverybody is or whether--Priya, I saw your hand, or\nyou were scratching your nose.AUDIENCE: Either ways, I'll go.GARY GENSLER: All

trends from\nseparate countriesand sort of identified\ntheir own statistics.You saw a lot of\ncountries that peopledon't feel that their payment\ndata or their payment identityis secure on a lot of\nmobile and digital devices.And that lack of security\nif preventing themfrom entering the\ndigital retail space.GARY GENSLER: How many people\nlooked at it that Worldpayarticle, read your own

to see you.AUDIENCE: It has to\ndo also with KYC AMLAnd to authorize the source of--the sender's identity and the\nsource of money, what countriesit's coming from.If it's above a certain\nthreshold or a certain amount,financial institutions\nhave further checks to--GARY GENSLER: So most systems\ndo what Aviva and Dan said.They have to say, we\nknow who the person is.They have the balance\nis in

when I saw the\nslides, you know, I--GARY GENSLER: I sent this\nAlin the slides last night.ALIN DRAGOS: So I\nsaw that there isa really interesting historical\ncomponent to all of this,as you rightly\npointed out, right.This all came from about four\ndecades' worth of evolutionhere.So we started-- you\nknow, you startedwith a very convoluted way,\nas it would appear now,to actually send out\npaper-based receiptsand have a plastic-based\ncard, if you will,that will have to be recorded\nand, you know-- first of all,you just say, does the\nperson have the money there?Right.Is the money there?I'm [INAUDIBLE] authorize.Right?I'm gonna get an answer\nright back, saying, yep.The money's there.OK.I just authorized it.But it's a very simple, like,\nping right back and forth.Right?So it needs to be a\nvery small transaction.From there on you\ncan start to say, OK.Now let's batch transactions\nand do the clearing.And then from there on you\nactually send on the money.Right?The interesting part\nabout all of thisis that it evolved in time.So this technology, if\nyou were to do it nowwith all of the tools that\nare at our disposal now,you'd do it\ndifferently, entirely.However, payments, as\nGary will point outin the next couple of slides,\nbasically evolved organicallythrough decades.And you know, they\nstarted with [INAUDIBLE]..GARY GENSLER: So stay with

telegraph came along in\nthe 1840's, if I remember.But Western Union took several\ndecades to come along and say,we can send instructions to\nmove value using the telegraph.And the Telex machine, which\nwas post-world War II-- and yes,I'm old enough to say\nthat there were stilltelex machines at\nGoldman Sachs whenI started in 1979\nthat you would typein to type in an instruction.So Alin,

there enough\nin their account?And so forth.That's the authorization phase.Now you'd say, well, can't that\nall be done simultaneously?And the answer is, yes.Maybe.But most of the\npayments system is stillbased on authorization,\nclearing, and then settlement.Financial ledgers that\nare also the reason.Ledgers record\neconomic activity.We've talked about this\nearlier in the semester.They record transactions\nor accounts.Bitcoin is a transaction ledger.Ethereum and others\nare account ledgers.But they're both ledgers.They're both forms of recording\nsomething that has a right.The data is

amongst\nthe things changing payment.It's not the only thing\nchanging payments.And then remember a bunch\nof attempts in the '90s?A bunch of ways to do\ndigital cash in the '90s?We talked about this
