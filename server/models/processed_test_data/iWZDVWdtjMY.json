seconds onthe clicker question.All right, and let's\nsee how we did.Alright, excellent job, 86%\nof you, that's right.What we had just done a\nclicker question on isdiscussing light as a particle\nand the photoelectric effect,so we're going to finish up with\na few points about thephotoelectric effect today.And then we're going to try a\ndemo to see if we can convinceourselves that the kind of\ncalculations we make work outperfectly, and we'll do\na test up here abouthalf way through class.And we'll also talk about photon\nmomentum as anotherexample of light behaving\nup as a particle.After that, we'll move on to\nmatter as a wave, and then theSchrodinger equation, which is\nactually a wave equation thatdescribes the behavior of\nparticles by taking intoaccount the fact that matter\nalso has these wave-likeproperties.So, starting back with the\nphotoelectric effect -- yes.STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] class last\ntime [INAUDIBLE] notes.PROFESSOR: Oh, sure.Can one of the TAs maybe come up\nand hand around anyone thatdidn't get notes?We have not yet perfected the\nart of entering and exitingthis classroom yet, we're\nstill working on that.Raise your hand if you need\nnotes and we'll make sure weget those to you.All right, so where we left\noff with the photoelectriceffect was when we first\nintroduced the effect, we weretalking about it in terms\nof frequencies.So, for example, we were talking\nabout a thresholdfrequency as in a minimum\nfrequency of light that youneed in order to eject an\nelectron from a metal surface.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.219}, {"text": "What Einstein then clarified for\nus was that we could alsobe talking about energies, and\nhe described the relationshipbetween frequency and energy\nthat they're proportional, ifyou want to know the energy,\nyou just multiply thefrequency by Planck's\nconstant.So, now we can talk about it\nin different terms, forexample, talking about e sub\ni, which is the incidentenergy or the energy of the\nlight that comes in, ortalking about work function\nhere, and that's just anotherway to say threshold energy.So, the work function's the\nminimum amount of energythat's required in order to\neject an electron, and most ofyou understand this relationship\nhere, which is alittle bit cut off, but it is\nall the way on in your notes,and that is what you saw the\nclicker question on -- how youcan figure out, for example,\nthe kinetic energy of theejected electron by looking at\nthe difference between howmuch energy you put in and how\nmuch energy is required toeject that electron in\nthe first place.So, in this class we'll be\ntalking about energy a lot,and it's often useful to draw\nsome sort of energy diagram tovisualize the differences in\nenergy that we're discussing.So, we do this here for the\nphotoelectric effect, and interms of the photoelectric\neffect, what we know theimportant point is that the\nincoming photon has to beequal or greater in energy\nthen the workfunction of the metal.So here we have energy\nincreasing on the y-axis, andyou see this straight line at\nthe bottom here is lower downon the graph, and that's the\nenergy of a bound electron, sothat's going to be a\nlow stable energy.But we see if we have a free\nelectron, as we do in thisdotted line here, that's going\nto be a higher energy that'sless stable.So, if we want to go from that\nstable state to that lessstable state, we need to put in\na certain amount of energyto our system, and that's what\nwe define as the work functionhere -- that difference between\nthe free electron andthe electron bound\nto the metal.So, the most basic case to\nunderstand, which is what we", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.479}, {"text": "just saw is a case where we\nhave the incident energycoming in, and that incident\nenergy is greater than thework function, and in that case\nwhat we see is that wehave an electron that\nis ejected.That makes sense and it also\nmakes sense that this littleextra bit here, that's the\namount of energy that we havethat goes into the kinetic\nenergy of the electrons.So, that's how we could\nalso graph figuringout the kinetic energy.So, in the second case what we\nhave is what happens if wehave the incident energy at some\namount that's less thanthe work function, and in this\ncase we're showing 1/2 of thework function.So in this case, we don't have\nenough energy to eject anelectron, so, an electron\nis not ejected.And that's pretty clear, too,\nand the question I want topose to you is instead\nthe third case here.So in the third case what I'm\nshowing is that we have -- nowwe're not just talking about 1\nphoton, we're talking about 3photons -- let's say we shoot\nthem all at the same time atour metal, each of them having\nsome energy that's let's say1/2 the work function.So, just to take a little bit\nof an informal survey, whothinks here that we will have\nan electron that isejected in this case?So a couple hands, all right.And what about who thinks\nthat we will not haveenough energy here?All right.We've got a big majority, and\nboth are logical ways ofthinking, but it turns out that\nthe majority is correct,which is not always the case,\nbut the electron is notejected in this case.And the reason for this, and\nthis is a very important pointabout the photoelectric effect,\nand the point here isthat the electrons here are\nacting as particles, you can'tjust add those energies\ntogether.One individual particle is being\nabsorbed by the metaland exciting an electron.So, having other particles\naround that have the sameenergy that you could\ntechnically add up if you wereadding them up like a wave, you\ncan't do the same thingwith particles, they're\nall separate.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.205}, {"text": "So, the take-home message is\nwhether you have three photonsor 3,000,000 photons that you're\nshooting at your metal,if you're not at that minimum\nfrequency or that minimumenergy that you need, nothing\nis going to happen.So, you might ask then well what\nis the significance ofshooting different amounts\nof photons at a metal?Is there any significance at\nall, for example, in thenumber of photons that are\nhitting the metal or beingabsorbed by the metal.And there is a relationship\nhere, and that is that thenumber of photons absorbed by\nthe metal are related to thenumber of electrons ejected\nfrom the metal.So, in this figure here what I'm\nactually showing is theselittle sunshines, which\nlet's say are eachone individual photon.So we had six photons going in,\nso the maximum number ofelectrons that we're going to\nhave coming out is also sixbecause the maximum scenario\nthat we could have that wouldmaximize the number of electrons\nis that each one ofthose photons comes in, excites\nan electron, ejects itfrom the surface of the metal.It's important to note, of\ncourse though, it's not justthe number, it's really\nimportant that the energy ofeach one of these individual\nphotons is, of course, greaterthan the work function\nof the metal.So, that's, in fact, it's that\nnumber of photons that we'retalking about when we refer to\nthe intensity of light, andthe intensity of light is\nproportional to that number,because when we talk about\nintensity, really we'retalking about the amount of\nenergy that a stream ofparticles, a stream of photons,\nhas per second.So, if we have a high intensity,\nwe're talking abouthaving more photons per second,\nand it's important toknow also what that\ndoes not mean.So it does not mean that we have\nmore energy per photon.This is a really important\ndifference.Intensity, if we increase\nthe intensity, we're notincreasing the energy in each\nphoton, we're just increasing", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.217}, {"text": "the number of photons that\nwe're shooting out of ourlaser, whatever our\nlight source is.And when we talk about intensity\nin terms of units,we usually talk about watts,\nso if you change yourlightbulb, usually you see the\nintensity in terms of watts.But in terms of SI units, which\nbecome much more usefulif you're actually trying to use\nintensity in a problem andcancel out your units, we're\njust talking about joules persecond is what intensity is.So at this point, you should\nbe able to have all thebackground you need on the\nphotoelectric effect to solveany type of problem that we\nthrow at you, and you seethree on this problem set, and\nwe'll probably give you onemore on your next problem set,\nand the reason we ask you somany questions about the\nphotoelectric effect isbecause it actually is very\nsimilar to ionization energythat we'll talk about later,\nalso problems dealing withphotoelectron spectroscopy.So, we want to make sure that\nthis is something the entireclass is 100% solid on.Sometimes the questions are\nworded quite differently, so Ijust want to sum up here\nthe different waysthey could be worded.For example, if we talk about\nphotons, of course, we alsojust mean light, sometimes\nwe refer to this aselectromagnetic radiation, and\nthere's several ways that youmight be asked this in a problem\nor that you might beasked to answer.Sometimes we might just directly\ntell you the energyof the photon -- that's probably\nthe easiest scenario,because when we think about\nwork functions those areusually reported in energy.So since that's the easiest\nscenario, you can probably besure it's not going to be too\nfrequently that you're justgiven the energy, right,\nthat might be too easy.So really what we'll probably do\nis instead either give youthe wavelength or the frequency\nand you'll go aheadand calculate the energy\nfrom there.In terms of talking about the\nelectrons, I wanted to pointout that in the book and other\nplaces you might see electronsreferred to as photoelectrons.That's sometimes confusing for\npeople, because it seems like", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.2}, {"text": "okay, is it a photon or\nis it an electron.I just want to clarify that\nit is an electron.It's called this just because\nit's an electron that resultswhen an electron absorbs a\nphoton's worth of energy, sothus it's a photoelectron.And if we talk about electrons\nor photoelectrons, again wecan describe it in terms of\nenergy, we can talk aboutvelocity, and from there, of\ncourse, you can figure out theenergy from 1/2 m v squared,\nand actually we can alsodescribe the electron in\nterms of wavelength.So you don't actually know\nthis yet from this class,you'll know it by the end of the\nclass that electrons can,in fact, have a wavelength.So once we cover it, it will\nthen be fair game to ask thesephotoelectron spectroscopy or\nthese photoelectric effectquestions using the wavelength\nof the electron.Also to point out, a lot of\ntimes you'll see electronvolts instead of joules, this is\nthe conversion factor herejust so you all have\nit in your notes.All right.So let's test what we, in\nfact, know about thephotoelectric effect, and before\nwe do that actually,we're going to calculate what\nwe would predict, so when wedo the demo it will be\nmeaningful and we can tellwhether we're successful\nor not.So hopefully we will\nbe successful.And as I point this out, we now\nknow how to do any kind ofphotoelectric effect problem,\nalso this means you should beable to go back to Monday's\nnotes where we filled in allthose graphs, which were what\ndifferent scientists wereobserving when they were\nmeasuring either the frequencyor the intensity of light that\nwas irradiating differenttypes of metals, and also the\nnumber of electrons ejected,and the kinetic energy of\nthose electrons ejected.You should be able to maybe\nprint out a blank copy ofthose notes from the website and\nfill in all those graphs-- not for memorizing them, but\nnow just understanding howthe photoelectric effect works.All right.So let's do an in-class problem,\nand this will be donewith zinc. We have a zinc plate\nup here, and we're goingto -- in a minute I'll describe\nhow we can probe if", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.196}, {"text": "electrons are coming\noff of it.But we're going to irradiate\nit with twodifferent light sources.We have a UV lamp right here,\nwhich is centered at awavelength of 254 nanometers.And then since we have my red\nlaser pointer, we will alsotry with the red laser pointer,\nwhich is centered atwavelength of 700 nanometers.So, there are a few questions\nthat we need to answer first.So we want to see, do we expect\nto eject electrons offof this metal surface, or do we\nexpect that we don't haveenough energy?So that means we're going to\nneed to figure out what is theenergy per photon that's emitted\nby that UV light.Also, what's the energy per\nphoton of this red laserpointer, and then it's also\nworth trying a calculationdealing with intensity.So let's also try calculating\nthe numbers of photons thatwould be emitted by this laser\npointer, if, for example, wewere to use it for 60 seconds\nand this were aone milliwatt laser.So, let's do some of these\ncalculations starting firstwith what is the energy per\nphoton, and let's start withthe UV lamp.So we know that energy is equal\nto Planck's constanttimes nu, but what we know\nabout the lamp is itswavelength, or the light\nthat's emitted.We know that nu is equal\nto c over wavelength.So we can figure out the energy\nof each photon emittedby our UV lamp by saying e is\nequal to h c over wavelength.So let's just plug in\nthese numbers here.That means our energy is equal\nto 6.626 times 10 to the -34joules times seconds.And then we have c, the speed\nof light, 2.998 times 10 tothe 8 meters per second.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.156}, {"text": "And we want to divide all of\nthat by our wavelength, and tokeep our units the same\nwe'll do meters.So that's 254 times 10\nto the -9 meters.So hopefully if some of you\nhave your calculators withyou, you can confirm the answer\nthat I got, which isthat the energy is 7.82 times\n10 to the -19 joules.So, remember what we're talking\nabout here is theamount of energy that's\nin each photon.So if we think about the work\nfunction for zinc, and thework function for zinc is 6.9\ntimes 10 to the -19 joules, dowe expect that when we shine\nour UV light on the zinc,we'll be able to eject\nelectrons?What do you think?Yes.Good.OK, anyone disagree?No, OK and that's correct,\nbecause each photon of lightactually has more\nenergy than isneeded to eject an electron.So, we would expect to see\nelectrons ejected with the UVlight source.So let's now think about using\ninstead the amount of energyper photon in that red\nlaser pointer.So again, we know that energy\nis equal to h c divided bywavelength, and energy is equal\nto -- you have writtenout in your notes what the\nactual value for h c is, butnow our wavelength is 700 times\n10 to the -9 meters.And what we end up with for the\nenergy then is

surface.So our last question we ask is\nwhat's the total number ofphotons emitted if we\ngive this givenintensity for 60 seconds?So, keep in mind that one\nmilliwatt is just the same assaying 1 times 10 to the\n-3 joules per second.So we have 1 times 10 to the -3\njoules per second, and wewant to multiply that by -- or\ncancel out how much energy wehave per photon, first of all,\nso how much energy do we haveper photon if we're talking\nabout the red laser pointer?Right.So this value right here.So for every photon\nwe have 2.84 times10 to the -19 joules.We're saying let's do\nthis for 60

there are\nin a laser beam of light.This is a huge number\nof photons.So the question is\ndoes this matter?How about if we shoot\nthis many photons?Does it make any difference at\nall in terms of whether we caneject an electron?No, it actually doesn't.It is an impressive number, it\nis very, very large, but itdoesn't make a difference.So we see that we do not eject\nelectrons in the case of

what our set up\nhere is as she does that.So basically what we have\nis this zinc plate here.So that's what we want to load\nup with electrons, and thensee if we can remove some.But that's a little bit hard,\nwe aren't all that good atseeing electrons with our eyes,\nso we need to think of away to do this.So what she's going to do\nis start loading up theelectrons, and you see this wand\nhere move slowly, and ittakes a while to do it, start\nbecome perpendicular.The reason for that is because\nall of this is connected, sowe're moving electrons\neverywhere in the system.And since we have two bars that\nare together like this,once they're both loaded up with\nelectrons there's goingto be negative charges that\nrepel, so the electrons willwant to get as far away as\npossible, and they're on theirslow way to doing that, to\ngetting as far away from eachother as possible.And if we do, in fact, hit\nit with light to get theelectrons off, it will go back\nto the straight up

went to that\nstuck point.But luckily we had the control\nof the red laser pointer wherenothing moved at all.So hopefully you're convinced\nthat your predictions workedwell and you are able to predict\nwhat's going on whenyou're looking at the\nphotoelectric effect.So, it turns out that the\nphotoelectric effect is notthe only evidence for the fact\nthat light has theseparticle-like characteristics.And one thing that Einstein\nput forth is he figured ifwell, what we're saying is\nthat light is, in fact, astream of particles, each one of\nthose particles or photonsmust, therefore, have\na momentum.And that's really neat to think\nabout, because photons,of course, are massless\nparticles, they have no mass,so it's neat to think about\nsomething that has no mass,but that actually does\nhave a momentum.And the relationship that he put\nforth is that the momentumis equal to Planck's constant\ntimes nu divided by the speedof light, or it's often more\nuseful for us to think aboutit in terms of wavelength.So, since the speed of light\nequals lambda nu, we can saythat momentum is equal to\nh divided by lambda.And there was experimental\nevidence that came along thatsupported this, and this is\ncalled the Compton scatteringexperiment, and this was done\nby Arthur Compton, andbasically what he did was he\ntook x-ray light, which hadsome frequency, which was a very\nhigh frequency because itwas x-rays, and he shot it\nat a stationary electron.And what he was able to observe\nwas that the electronsscattered and now had some\nmomentum, and that both thefrequency, and therefore, the\nmomentum of the light that he", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.391}, {"text": "shot in, went down once\nit was scattered.So what he's showing here is,\nfirst of all, that the lighthas some momentum and when it\nhits an electron it canactually transfer some of that\nmomentum to the electron.So the transfer of momentum from\na photon to an electronis what was being observed, and\nit was seen as completelyseparate evidence to the\nphotoelectric effect that,yes, in fact, light is\nbehaving in theseparticle-like ways.So up to this point, before it\nwas really established thatyes, light is like a particle\nsometimes, there was this verystrong distinction\nbetween what islight and what is matter.And the distinction was when\nwe're talking about light,light is a wave, and when we're\ntalking about matter,well, matter is a particle.And these behave completely\nseparate, they don't overlapat all in terms of behavior, but\nthen, of course, with thephotoelectric effect with\nCompton's scattering, what wesee is that, oh actually,\nsometimes photons behave as ifthey're particles.So now this relationship's\nbeginning to get a little bitfuzzy in terms of what is the\ndifference between how wetreat light and matter.And actually, this was taken\na step further by Louis deBroglie who in his PhD thesis,\nas part of his work as agraduate student, put forth the\nidea that, OK, Einsteinsays, and everyone agrees\nthat, in fact, light isparticle-like at times, and\nlight, in fact, of course hasa wavelength, and if it has a\nwavelength we're saying thatit can have momentum.And what de Broglie said is\nwell, if it's true that light,which has a wavelength can have\nmomentum, then it mustalso be true that matter, which\nhas momentum, also has

Prize, but I thinkthe more representative way to\nthink about this is the realrevolutionary idea that he put\nforth, which is that mattercan actually behave as a wave.\nAnd in terms of equations thatwe use, it's sometimes easier\nto plug in the fact, sincemomentum is equal to mass\ntimes velocity.We can know the wavelength of\nany matter -- and he's notlimiting this, for example,\nto electrons.What de Broglie is saying we can\nknow the wavelength of anymatter at all, as long\nas we know itsmass and it's velocity.And Einstein credited de\nBroglie, which is a fairstatement of lifting a corner\nof the great veil, becausereally there was this\nfundamental misunderstandingabout what the difference was\nbetween matter and light, andthe reality is that they can\nboth be like-particles andthey can both show\ncharacteristics of waves.So I mentioned, however, that in\nterms of de Broglie's work.This was Nobel Prize worthy,\nabsolutely, but it was alsohis PhD thesis.So, we can think about what\nwould happen if we're on histhesis defense, we're on his\nthesis committee, we wouldneed to think of some pretty\nmean, hard, nasty questions tobe asking de Broglie about this\ntheory -- that's whathappens when you defend\nyour thesis.This is necessary, it's hard to\nfind holes in a Nobel Prizeworthy idea.But let's just try maybe one\nof the basic questions theycould ask, and they can say, all\nright, de Broglie, so yousay that all matter, absolutely\nall matter haswave-like behavior.Why is it that we're never\nobserving this, for example,why is it the table doesn't\ndefract as we bringit through the door?Why don't we see the influence\nof the wave-like behavior onevery day matter?So it turns out that he could\nhave picked anything toexplain this, and hopefully done\nout the calculation, andwe'll do this ourselves.And the example we'll pick is\nconsidering, for example, aMatsuzaka fastball.So, many of you are new to the\nBoston area, now I still",

unit analysis.The seconds cross out, the\nkilograms cross out, one of", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.233}, {"text": "the meters crosses out from the\ntop, so we're left with ananswer in meters.It's

the -31 meters.So, this is really small, this\nis undetectably small.And especially when we consider\nit, what tends to beimportant is the size of\nwavelength in relationship toits environment.So 1.1 times 10 to the -31\nmeters is not, in fact, asignificant number when we're\ncomparing it, for example, tothe length of a ball, or the\nsize of the baseball field.So that would probably be de\nBroglie's answer for why, infact, we're not observing the\nwavelength behavior ofmaterial on a day-to-day life.So, that's for Matsuzaka, and\neven if you don't memorize allthe wavelengths for\nall

showing here --they all have different\nstrengths.It's not always how fast you\nthrow the fastball, sometimesit's your different styles or\nthe different ways that youdecide when to throw what.So, first we have Matsuzaka\nat 94 miles per hour.So, click one if you think that\nhe's going to have thelongest wavelength.Tim Wakefield on the DL right\nnow throws a lot slower,because he has that

So this is, first\nof all, even just on anabsolute scale, this is way,\nway larger than thewavelengths we're talking\nabout for baseball.In addition, if we compare this\nto the diameter of anatom, which is on the order of\nsomewhere between one and tenangstroms, now we're seeing\nthat, in fact, this wavelengthis significantly larger\nthan its environment.So certainly we would expect to\nsee that it has an effectin terms of seeing its\nwave-like properties.And this was experimentally\nvalidated, hopefully, evenmore clearly than our\nexperiment here.And at first this was done by\nDavidson and Germer, and theywere American scientists who\ntried defracting electronsfrom a nickel crystal.They did this in Bell\nLaboratories, and they foundthat, in fact, the electronis\ndid defract.And G.P.

Thomson from\nour second lecture, and J.J.Thomson got a Nobel Prize\nin 1906 for showing thatelectrons exist in that\nthey are particles.And it turns out that G.P.\nThompson, well, that's hisson, so we can actually think\nof this -- and I'm sure thiswasn't the case, but I like to\nthink of it as a little bit ofchild rebelling against\nthe father.So, the father gets a Nobel\nPrize for showing that anelectron is a particle, and the\nson says, well, what can Ido to top that?I'm going to show the\nexact opposite.I'm going to say that an\nelectron's a wave no matterhow much my father says\ndifferently, and I'm going toget a Nobel Prize for\nthat, and he does.But the nice part of the\nstory is, it turns outthey're both right.An electron is a particle, but\nan electron's also a wave. So,father and son, happy\nending, they bothhave their Noble prizes.So, what happens now that\nwe, in fact, knowthat matter is a wave?Well, this allows us to try to\ngo back and explain somephenomena that over the years,\nmounting evidence was buildingthat couldn't be explained.So, for example, when people,\nand we'll talk about this nextclass, were looking at different\ncharacteristicsspectra of different atoms, what\nthey were seeing is thatit appeared to be these very\ndiscreet lines that were", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.166}, {"text": "allowed or not allowed for the\ndifferent atoms to emit, butthey had no way to explain this\nusing classical physics.And it turns out that the\nSchrodinger equation is anequation of motion in which\nyou're describing a particleby describing it as a wave. So\nyou're basically having a waveequation for a particle, and for\nour purposes we're talkingabout a very particular\nparticle.What we're interested\nin is the electron.So basically describing\nelectrons by their wave-likeproperties.And this is Erwin Schrodinger,\nand this is the equation thathe put forth where we have h hat\npsi being equal to e psi.So, let's explain\nwhat these are.So this symbol here\nis actually whatwe call a wave function.That doesn't mean a whole lot\nin itself, it will mean morein about two lectures\nfrom now.But right now, what I want you\nto be thinking of a wavefunction as is just some\nrepresentation of an electron.So, it's some way of describing\nan electron.Specifically, we'll talk more\nabout this, it's talking aboutdifferent orbitals, it's the\nspatial part of an orbital.But before we get to that, in\nterms of thinking just think,OK, this is representing my\nparticle, this is representingmy electron that's what\nthe wave function is.This e term here is the energy,\nor in our case when wetalk about an electron in a\nhydrogen atom, for example,the binding energy of that\nelectron to the nucleus.So, e is binding energy.And h with the carrot or the hat\nhere, well, that carrot orhat tell us it must be an\noperator, and this is calledthe Hamiltonian operator.So when you operate on the wave\nfunction, what you end upwith is getting the binding\nenergy of the electron, andthe wave function back out.When we need to describe the\nwave function term a littlebit more specifically so we can\ndescribe, for example, the", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.198}, {"text": "position of the electron, and I\njust want to mention that wedo have two choices if we're\ntrying to describe this, wecould use cartesian coordinates,\nor we could usepolar coordinates where we're\neither talking about x y z orr theta and phi.So, I just want to point out\nthat when you look at wavefunctions, we are going to be\nusing those spherical polarcoordinates, and the reason is\nbecause a very importantinteraction here is the\ninteraction between theelectron and the nucleus, which\nwe want to describe thedistance of in terms of r.So, you can see, it's much\neasier to describe that as oneterm, r here, instead of\nusing both y and z.Another reason I wanted to point\nthis out in terms of thepolar coordinates that we're\nusing, is I think they'reactually flipped from\nwhat you're usedto seeing in physics.Sometimes different disciplines\nhave differentconventions, which can be very\nconfusing because the wholepoint of what's happening now\nis there's so much interplaybetween different disciplines,\nbut still I think this mightbe one remaining one where\nin our case theta is thatdistance from z, that angle\nthere, where phi is thisdistance or angle\nfrom the x-axis.So just keep it in mind\nthat it's flipped.It turns out we won't really\nusing it, needing to identifyit on the graph so much\nin chemistry.We'll be using the solutions,\nso you shouldn't have aproblem, but I wanted to point\nit out so it does not look toostrange to you.In terms of the Schrodinger\nequation, we now can write itin terms of our polar\ncoordinates here.So we have the operation on the\nwave function in terms ofr, theta, and phi and remember\nthis e is just our bindingenergy for the electron,\nand we get backout this wave function.So, you might ask, this looks\npretty simple up here, right,just with that h hat.It turns out, we can\nwrite it out fully.It's three different second\nderivatives in terms of thethree different parameters.", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.21}, {"text": "It's a little bit complicated.You won't have to solve it in\nthis class, you can wait tillyou get to 18.03 to start\nsolving these types ofdifferential equations, and\nhopefully, you'll all want thepleasure of actually solving\nthe Schrodinger equation atsome point.So, just keep taking chemistry,\nyou'll already havehad 18.03 by that point\nand you'll have theopportunity to do that.What I want to point out also\nis that this h hat, theHamiltonian operator written out\nfor the simplest case wecan even imagine, which is a\nhydrogen atom where we onlyhave one electron that we're\ndealing with, and of course,one nucleus.So you can imagine it's just\ngoing to get more and morecomplicated as we get to other\ntypes of atoms, and of course,molecules from there.So, we just want to appreciate\nthat what we'll be using inthis class is, in fact, the\nsolutions to the Schrodingerequation, and just so you can\nbe fully thankful for nothaving to necessarily solve\nthese as we jump into thesolutions and just knowing that\nthey're out there andyou'll get to solve\nit at some point,hopefully, in your careers.So, we'll pick up with that,\nwith some of the solutions andstarting to talk about\nenergies on Friday.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.356}]
