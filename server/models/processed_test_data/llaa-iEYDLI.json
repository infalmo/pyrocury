C. San Diego.The three of these chemists\nsplit the Nobel Prize thismorning for their discovery\nand/or their application ofusing green fluorescent\nprotein, whichis also called GFP.How many of you have heard\nof GFP before?Oh, that's so great.OK.Many of you have heard of GFP.For some of you that haven't\nI'll just say that it's aprotein, it's 238 amino acids,\nwhich means that it's about1,000, actually more than 1,000\natoms in size, and thisprotein is fluorescent.The protein was first discovered\nand first isolatedfrom this jellyfish here.This was done by Shimomura,\nand he did this inthe 60's and 70's.He actually recognized and, of\ncourse, many people recognizedthat this jellyfish was\nfluorescent, and he isolatedthe actual protein, and\ndetermined and proved thatthis protein was sufficient to\ncause this fluorescence.So, in terms of thinking about\napplications of why it's soexciting that you have this\nfluorescent protein, otherthan it's always really fun\nto look at things that arefluorescent, we can think about\nin terms of biology whyit's so exciting, you can\nactually tag this protein toany other protein that you're\nstudying and now you have a", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "visual handle on what's\ngoing on.So, for example, if you were\ninterested in some proteininvolved in cancer, you\ncould tag it with GFP.You could watch where it\nlocalizes in the cell, thereare fluorescent assays you could\nuse to determine whatother proteins it\ninteracts with.You could see, for example,\nwhen it's expressed in acancer cell, and where\nit's expressed.There are all sorts of things\nyou can do once you canvisualize something\nwith fluorescence.The reason it is so exciting\nthat it's a protein, and it'sa protein, this is the structure\nhere, it's a ribbonstructure so you can kind of see\nwhat it looks like, it'smade up of all natural\namino acids.So this means we can code for\nit in DNA, you don't have toworry how am I going to\nget into the cell.All you have to do is mutate\nthe DNA, which is verystraightforward to do in\nmolecular biology, and now youcan tag absolutely any protein\nthat you're interested in.So, as I said, this was first\ndiscovered and isolated fromthe jellyfish.This was done by Shimomura --\nthat was kind of the firststep in this process of having\nit become such a useful tool.And then, many years later,\nnot until 1994 did MartinChalfi, at Columbia, show that\nyes, I can, in fact, take theDNA and put it into a different\norganism, and he putit into e coli, a bacteria.And what he could show was that\nit could be expressed,this is a picture from his 1994\nscience paper, in that ecoli, and it is going\nto fluoresce green.Now, the first application\ntends to not be quite asexciting as, for example, all\nthe other organisms peoplehave put it in since then --\nyou can have flies, you seetransgenic mice that are glowing\ngreen with this GFP.Of course, that's not the useful\napplication for it,it's more of a proof of\nprinciple, but it does showyou that you can put it in for\nstudies in any organisms.And the field was really\npushed forward by thediscoveries of Robert Chen at UC\nSan

today,not just the scientific\njournals, and get to readsomething about chemistry.It's always fun to see how its\ndescribed in The New YorkTimes or in The Boston Globe.The other thing I wanted to\nmention and I'm not sure ifthe exhibit's still there.But there was an exhibit of\njellyfish, I know at leastuntil last year, at the Boston\nMuseum of Science, and all ofyou guys can get\nin there

IAP or some time like that.All right, so let's move\ninto today's notes.Today we're talking about\nmolecular orbital theory.This is a shift, this is a new\ntopic that we're starting.So far we've exclusively been\nusing Lewis structures anytime we've tried to describe\nbonding within molecules.Lewis structures are really\nuseful, we use them all thetime in chemistry.And they're useful because,\nfirst of all, they're easy todepict, they're easy to draw --\nrelatively easy once we getall the rules down.And also they're accurate\nover 90% of the time.But they're not accurate all the\ntime in predicting bondingwithin molecules, and the reason\nfor this is becauseLewis structures are\nnot, in fact,based on quantum mechanics.So, molecular orbital theory, on\nthe other hand, is based onquantum mechanics.And specifically, MO theory\nis the quantum mechanicaldescription of wave functions\nwithin molecules.So, saying wave functions within\nmolecules might sound alittle confusing, but remember\nwe spent a lot of time talkingabout wave functions within\natoms, and we know how to", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.143}, {"text": "describe that, we know that a\nwave function just means anatomic orbital.It's the same thing with\nmolecules -- a molecular wavefunction just means a\nmolecular orbital.So, we'll start today talking\nabout the two kinds ofmolecular orbitals, we can\ntalk about bonding oranti-bonding orbitals.Then we're going to actually\nuse MO theory to describebonding within these molecules,\nand we'll startwith homonuclear diatomic\nmolecules.Diatomic mean it's di atomic,\nit's made up of two atoms, andhomonuclear means that those two\nare the same atoms. Thenat the end, we'll look at an\nexample with a heteronucleardiatomic molecules.So, again, the same thing, but\nnow two different atoms.So, I will point out, in terms\nof MO theory, because itrigorously does take into\naccount quantum mechanics, itstarts to become complicated\nonce we gobeyond diatomic molecules.So we're going to limit in our\ndiscussion in 511-1 formolecular orbital theory\nto diatomic molecules.However, on Friday we will use a\ndifferent approach so we cantalk about bonding within atoms\nthat have more than twoatoms, molecules with\nmore than two atoms.All right, so one thing that I\nfirst want to point out aboutMO theory that is a big\ndifference from Lewisstructures, is that in MO theory\nvalence electrons arede-localized over the\nentire molecule.So, when we talked about Lewis\nstructures, we actuallyassigned electrons to individual\natoms or toindividual bonds.Whereas in molecular orbital\ntheory, what I'm telling youis instead we understand that\nthe electrons are spread allover the molecule, they're not\njust associated with a singleatom or a single bond.So specifically, what we do\nassociate them instead iswithin molecular orbitals, and\nwhat we say is that they canbe either in bonding or\nanti-bonding orbitals.And again, I want to point out\nthat a molecular orbital, wecan also call that\na wave function,they're the same thing.And these orbitals arise from\nthe combination of individualatomic orbital.So, if we have two atomic\norbitals coming together fromtwo different atoms and they\ncombine, what we end up", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.121}, {"text": "forming is a molecular\norbital.The reason that we can talk\nabout this is remember thatwe're talking about wave\nfunctions, we're talking aboutwaves, so we can have\nconstructive interference inwhich two different orbitals can\nconstructively interfere,we can also have destructive\ninterference.So, we'll start by taking\na look at constructiveinterference, and another way to\nexplain this is just to sayagain, molecular orbitals\nare a linearcombination of atomic orbitals.So, let's start our discussion\nof a bonding orbital.Our simplest case that we can\nlook at would be if we had two1 s orbitals coming together.So let's say, for example,\nin a hydrogen atom.So in hydrogen atom a, I'll\ndepict that here where thenucleus is this dot, and then\nthe circle is what I'mdepicting as the\nwave function.It makes sense to draw the wave\nfunction as a circle,because we do know\nthat 1 s orbitalsare spherically symmetric.So, we can say that a circle is\na good approximation for a1 s wave function.Similarly, with the second\nhydrogen atom, we've got thenucleus in the middle, and the 1\ns b wave function around it.So these are atomic orbitals.What we're going to do in\nforming a molecule is justbring these two orbitals close\ntogether such that now we havetheir nucleus, the two nuclei,\nat a distance apart that'sequal to the bond length.And what we end up forming is\na molecular orbital, becauseas we bring these two atomic\norbitals close together, thepart between them, that wave\nfunction, constructivelyinterferes such that in our\nmolecular orbital, we actuallyhave a lot of wave function\nin between the two nuclei.So we can go ahead and name our\nmolecular orbital, justlike we know how to name\nour atomic orbitals.And I'm going to name\nthis sigma 1 s.The 1 s just comes from the\nfact that the molecularorbital is a combination of\ntwo 1 s atomic orbitals.And the sigma tells us something\nabout the symmetryof this molecular orbital,\nspecifically that it'scylindrically symmetric\nabout the bond axis.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So that is the bond axis -- it's\njust the axis between thetwo nuclei.Sometimes it's also called\nthe internuclear axis.So any time you have two atoms\nbonding, the bond axis is justthe axis that they're\nbonding along.Another thing I want to point\nout about every sigma orbitalthat you see, and it will make\nmore sense when we contrast itwith pi orbitals later.But in sigma orbitals, you have\nno nodal planes along thebond axis, so if we had a nodal\nplane here, we'd see anarea where the wave function\nwas equal to zero.We don't see that.It will make more sense when we\ncan show you one where itdoes have that area.But keep in mind sigma orbitals\nhave no nodal planesalong the bond axis.All right.So, let's look at this in\nanother way, sometimes it'shard to picture these\nwaves combining.So let's think of them a little\nbit more by graphingthe amplitude of the wave, and\nseeing how we can have thisconstructive interference.So again, if we think of a graph\nof the wave function, wehad the wave function is at\nits highest amplitude whenit's lined up with the nucleus,\nand then as we gotfurther away from the nucleus,\nthe amplitude of the wavefunction ends up tapering off\nuntil -- it never hits zeroexactly, but it goes\ndown very low.So we can draw that for 1 s a,\nwe can also draw it for 1 s b,and what I'm saying for the\nmolecular wave function isthat we have the interference\nbetween the two, and we have aconstructive interference, so\nwe end up adding these twowave functions together.So, we're talking about wave\nfunctions and we know thatmeans orbitals, but this is --\nprobably the better way tothink about is the physicalinterpretation of the wave function.So what is the wave function\nsquared going to be equal to?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Probability\ndensity, yes.Probability density of finding\nan electron within thatmolecule in some given volume.So let's think about that\ninstead, let's think aboutprobability density.So if we're talking about\nprobability density that's thewave function squared.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "But now we're talking not about\nan atomic wave function,we're talking about a molecular\nwave function.So to talk about it's squared,\nwe're going to say it's sigma1 s squared.Oh, and actually before you skip\nyour page in the notes, Irealized I should write out for\nyou what the addition isto start with.So, when we're combining two\nwaves, what we have is 1 s athat we're adding together\nwith 1 s forb, the second atom.And what we end up for\nour molecular wavefunction is sigma 1 s.So this is what we call\nour molecular orbital.All right, so that will now\nallow you to turn the page, Ithink, and we can take a look\nat the probability.So the probability again,\nthat's just the orbitalsquared, the wave function\nsquared.So when we write that out, we\njust write sigma 1 s squared,or we can break it up into its\nindividual parts, there's noreason we can't do\nthat as well.So just to say that it's 1 s\nsquared plus 1 s b, all ofthat together squared.So if we write out every term\nindividually, what we end upwith is essentially just the\nprobability density for thefirst atom, then the probability\ndensity for thesecond atom, and then we have\nthis last term here, and thisis what ends up being the\ninterference term.So in this case where we're\nadding it together, this isgoing to be constructive\ninterference.So in this case the cross term\nrepresents constructiveinterference between the two\n1 s atomic wave functions.And this again is what\nwe're going tocall a bonding orbital.So it can often make a lot more\nsense if we think aboutthings in terms of energy.We've been discussing energy\ndiagrams a lot in this class,it's a very good way to\nvisualize exactlywhat's going on.So, let's think of the energy\nof interaction when we'recomparing atomic orbitals to\nmolecular bonding orbitals.And what you find is when you\nhave a bonding orbital, the", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "energy decreases compared\nto the atomic orbitals.So you can see here in this\nslide we have the atomicorbitals for the two hydrogen\natoms, each of them have oneelectron in them, hydrogen has\none electron in a 1 s orbital.So, if we look at the molecular\norbital, that'sactually going to be lower in\nenergy than either of the twoatomic orbitals.So it's going to be favorable\nfor the electrons instead togo to that lower energy\nstate and be withinthe molecular orbital.So, let's draw in our electrons\nthere, so we haveour two electrons now in\nthe molecular orbital.So any time that you're drawing\nthese molecularorbital diagrams, you want to\nkeep in mind that the numberof electrons that you have in\natomic orbitals, you need toadd those together\nand put that manyelectrons into your molecule.Right, we had one from each\natom, so that means we need atotal of two in our\nmolecular orbital.And what you can see directly\nfrom looking at this energylevel diagram, is that the\nmolecule that we have is nowmore stable in the individual\natoms. That makes sensebecause we're lower in energy,\nthe electrons arenow lower in energy.So that's the idea of a bonding\nmolecular orbital.Since we're talking about wave\nfunctions, since we're talkingabout the properties of waves,\nwe don't only haveconstructive interference, we\ncan also imagine a case wherewe would have destructive\ninterference.Just like we see destructive\ninterference with water wavesor with light waves, we can\nalso see destructiveinterference with orbitals.So, let's think about what\nthat would look like.So in this case we would have\n1 s a and 1 s b, and insteadwe would subtract one from the\nother, and what we would seeis that instead of having\nadditional, more wave functionin the middle here, we've\nactually cancelled out thewave function and we\nend up with a node.So we can also name this\norbital, and this orbitalwe're going to call\nsigma 1 s star.So if we name this orbital,\nthis is an anti-bonding", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "molecular orbital.So we had bonding and now\nwe're talking aboutanti-bonding.When we talk about anti-bonding,\nessentiallywe're taking 1 s a and now we're\nsubtracting 1 s b, andwhat we end up with again is\nsigma 1 s, and the importantthing to remember is to\nwrite this star here.So any time you see a\nstar that means ananti-bonding orbital.Again we can look at this in\nterms of thinking about apicture this way, in terms of\ndrawing the wave function outon an axis.So we have 1 s a, and we're\ndrawing this as having apositive amplitude, but since\nwe have destructiveinterference we're going to\ndraw 1 s b as having theopposite sign, so we\nhave a plus and aminus in terms of signs.So that should make it very easy\nto picture that this isbeing cancelled out\nin the middle.If we overlay what the actual\nmolecular orbital is on top ofit, what you see is that in\nthe center you end upcancelling out the wave\nfunction entirely.So this is the 1 s star, sigma 1\ns star orbital, and what youhave in the center here is a\nnode, right in the centerbetween the two nuclei.So again if we look at this\nin terms of its physicalinterpretation or probability\ndensity, what we need to do issquare the wave function.So if we square sigma 1 s star,\nwe flip the amplitude soit's all positive now, but again\nwe still have this noderight in the middle.So if we talk about the\nprobability density and wewrite that in, it's going to be\nsigma 1 s star squared, sonow we're talking about\n1 s a minus 1 s b, allof that being squared.And again, if we write out what\nall the terms are, weagain have 1 s a squared plus\n1 s b squared, but now whatwe're doing is we're actually\nsubtracting theinterference term.So if we're subtracting the\ninterference term, what wehave here now is destructive\ninterference.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So let's think about the energy\nof interaction here.When we were talking about\nconstructive interference, wehad more electron density\nin between the 2 nuclei.So that lowered the energy\nof the molecular orbital.So, bonding orbitals\nare down here.But when we think about where\nanti-bonding orbitals shouldbe, it should be higher\nin energy.It's increased compared to\nthe atomic orbitals.So we would label our\nanti-bonding orbital higher inenergy than our 1 s\natomic orbitals.So, let's think a little bit\nabout what this means.First of all, again to repeat,\nany time we see the star,sigma 1 s star, that's an\nanti-bonding orbital.When we talk about that,\nbasically what we're saying,and you can see that because of\nthat negative interference,we actually have less electron\ndensity between the nucleithan we did when they were two\nseparate atoms. So you can seethat this is non-bonding,\nthis is even worse thannon-bonding, it's anti-bonding,\nbecause we'reactually getting rid of electron\ndensity between thetwo nuclei.And we know that it's electron\ndensity between the nucleithat holds two atoms\ntogether in a bond.So what I want to point out is\nthat it creates an effect thatis exactly opposite of a bond.You might have thought before\nwe started talking aboutmolecular orbital theory that\nnon-bonding was the oppositeof bonding, it's not,\nanti-bonding is the oppositeof bonding, and anti-bonding\nis not non-bonding.We can see that if we just look\nat this picture here.Here is bonding, and here\nis non-bonding.Anti-bonding is even higher in\nenergy than non-bonding.And the other thing to point out\nis that the energy that ananti-bonding orbital is raised\nby, is the same amount as abonding orbital is lowered by.So any time I draw these\nmolecular orbitals, I do mybest, and I'm not always\nperfect, yet trying to makethis energy different exactly\nthe same for the anti-bondingorbital being raised,\nversus the bonding", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "orbital being lowered.So those should be raised and\nlowered by the same energy.So now let's take a look\nat some of -- is therea question up there?STUDENT: Why would two atoms\ndecide to [INAUDIBLE].PROFESSOR: Well, they\ndon't want to.It's a higher energy\nsituation.So we'll start to look at\nmolecules and we'll see if wetake two atoms and we fill in\nour molecular orbital and itturns out that they have more\nanti-bonding orbitals thanbonding, that's -- a diatomic\nmolecule we'll never see.So it helps us predict, will we\nsee this, for example, h 2,which we're going to be about to\ndo, we'll see is stabilizedbecause it has more bonding\nthan anti-bonding.So we'll predict, yes,\nthere's a bond here.That's a really good question.So, let's go ahead and do this\nand take a look at some of theactual atoms that we can\nthink about and thinkabout them in molecules.So our simplest case that we\nstarted talking about wasmolecular hydrogen.I want to finish this discussion\nby including theanti-bonding orbital, and this\nis a tip for you when you'redrawing your molecular orbital\ndiagrams, any time you draw abonding orbital, there is\nalso an anti-bondingorbital that exists.It might not have any electrons\nin it, but it stillexists, so you need to draw\nthese into your molecularorbital diagram.So I wanted to make sure you\nhave a complete set forhydrogen in your notes.So let's take a look at this.Hydrogen, we can first draw\nin our atomic electrons.So there's one electron\nin each hydrogen atom.And then this means we'll have\na total of two electrons inour hydrogen molecule, so we\ncan fill both of those intothe sigma 1 s orbital,\nthe bonding orbital.We don't have to put anything\ninto the anti-bonding orbital,so that's great.What we've seen is we have a net\nlowering of energy of themolecule versus the\nindividual atoms.So let's draw the electron\nconfiguration of hydrogen, the", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "molecule, molecular hydrogen.What you saw, what we've done\na lot of is drawing theelectron configurations for\ndifferent atoms, we can do thesame thing for a molecule.So, if we take h 2, and we\nwant to draw the electronconfiguration, it's\nvery short.All it is sigma 1 s, and then\nwe have two electrons in it,so it's sigma 1 s squared.So this is our electron\nconfiguration.Let's take a look at\nanother example.Let's draw the molecular\ndiagram for h e 2 now.So again, we can fill in our\natomic orbitals here, there'sgoing to be two electrons in\neach of our atomic orbitals.So now let's go ahead and fill\nin our molecular orbitals.We need to fill in a total\nof four electrons.So we have two electrons in\nour bonding orbital, butbecause we use the same rules to\nfill up molecular orbitalsas we do atomic orbitals, so the\nPauli exclusion principletells us we can't have more\nthan two electrons perorbital, so we have\nto go up to ouranti-bonding orbital here.So this means that we have two\nof the electrons are loweredin energy, but two are\nraised in energy.So would this be a stabilized\nmolecule then?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: No.So, compared to the atoms, it\nshould be somewhat the sameenergy, we shouldn't get any\nextra stabilization fromforming the molecule.So lets go ahead and write\nwhat the electronconfiguration would\nbe of h e 2.And again, we're just filling in\nthe different orbitals, sowe have sigma 1 s, that's going\nto be squared, and nowwe have sigma 1 s\nstar squared.So we can compare the two\nelectron configurations, andwe can actually think about --\nwhat we figure out from them,we see that two are lowered in\nenergy, two electrons areraised in energy, so we have no\nnet gain or no net loss inenergy for h e 2.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And there's actually a way that\nwe can make predictionshere, and what I'll tell you\nis molecular orbital theorypredicts that h e 2 does not\nexist because it's notstabilized in terms of\nforming the molecule.The way that we can figure this\nout is using somethingcalled bond order, and bond\norder is equal to 1/2 timesthe number of bonding electrons,\nminus the number ofanti-bonding electrons.And the bond order you get out\nwill either be, for example,zero, which would mean that you\nhave no bond, or you couldhave 1, a single bond, 1 .5, a 1 and 1/2 bond, 2, a\ndouble bond, and so on.So let's figure out the bond\norder for our two moleculeshere that we figured out the\nelectron configuration for.So I guess we'll start\nwith helium 2.So the bond order is going to\nbe equal to 1/2, and then itwill be 2 minus 2.So our bond order for h e 2\nis going to be equal to 0.So it has a 0 bond, there's\nno bond in h e 2.Let's look for hydrogen.For hydrogen our bond order is\ngoing to equal 1/2, 2 minus 0.So we would predict\na bond order of 1.What kind of a bond is\na bond order of 1?Yeah, we'd expect to see a\nsingle bond in hydrogen.So what actually turns out the\nreality is that h e 2 doesexist, but it exists as the\nweakest chemical bond known,and it wasn't, in fact, even\nfound to exist until 1993, soI can assure you this is not a\nbond that you see very oftenin nature, and it is a\nvery, very weak bond.It

of a bond for hydrogen,and molecular hydrogen is\neverywhere around us, we see432 kilojoules per mole.All right, so we can now see a\nlittle bit of what the powerof molecular orbital theory is\nin predicting what kind ofbonds we're going to see in\nmolecules, or whether or notwe'll see this bonding\noccur at all.So let's look at another\nexample, let's take lithium 2and see what we can\nfigure out here.In lithium 2, we have two atoms\nof lithium, each havethree electrons in them.So now we have to include both\nthe 1 s orbitals and also the2 s orbitals.So any time in a molecular\norbital diagram you draw inorbitals, you need to draw thecorresponding molecular orbitals.So, this means we need to have\nsigma 1 s, sigma 1 s star, andnow sigma 2 s and\nsigma 2 s star.Something I'll also point out\nas you see these dashed linethat tell you where the\nindividual molecular orbitalsare arising from, as you get\nto higher and higher atomicnumbers of molecules that you're\nmaking, it makes a lotmore sense to look at a diagram\nwhen you draw thesedotted lines in, because\nthey can start to geta little bit confusing.So when you go ahead and draw\nthese on your problem-sets oron your exams, it's a good idea\nto put these dashed linesin, both for you and for people\nreading it to seeexactly where your molecular\norbitals are coming from.So, this means we have a total\nof six electrons that we needto put into molecular\norbitals.So again we just start filling\nthose up -- we have two in the1 s, two in the sigma 1 s star,\nand then we have two inthe sigma 2 s.So we should be able to also\ncalculate the bond order, justlike we did for hydrogen\nand helium.First we can do that by\nknowing the electronconfiguration, we can write it\nout just by going up the tablehere, up the energy levels.And you can go ahead and tell\nme what you think the bond", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "order is going to be\nfor this molecule.All right.Let's take 10 more\nseconds on this.OK, good, we're back on\ntrack a little bitwith our clicker answers.So it's selection three or\none is the bond order.So let's switch back to our\nclass notes and look at whatthis means.So we know that it's 1, because\nwe have 1, 2, 3, 4bonding, minus 2 anti-bonding,\nand 1/2 of that is a bondorder of 1.We would predict to see a single\nbond between lithium,and it turns out that's\nwhat we see.And so you have for a reference,\nthe dissociationenergy of lithium 2 is 105\nkilojoules per mole.So let's keep moving along the\nperiodic table and keepapplying our molecular\norbitals.For example now, with b e 2,\nso beryllium 2 has fourelectrons in terms\nof each atom.So you can start by filling\nthose in, and now we can fillin our molecular orbitals\nas well.This means we need a total\nof eight electrons in ourmolecular orbitals.So we have two in 1 s, two in\nthe sigma 1 s star, two in thesigma 2 s, and two in\nthe sigma 2 s star.So let's go ahead and figure\nout the bonding

minusanti-bonding is 4, so we end up\ngetting a bond order that'sequal to 0.So what I want to point out with\nthis case in beryllium isthat you don't have to use all\nof the electrons to figure outthe bond order, and in fact,\nonce you get to molecules thatare from atoms with atomic\nnumbers of 8 or 10, you're notgoing to want to maybe\ndraw out the fullmolecular orbital diagram.So what I want to tell you is\nwe also always get the samebond order if we instead\nonly dealwith the valence electrons.So let's just prove that to\nourselves and figure out thebond order just using\nvalence electrons.So this would mean the bond\norder is equal to 1/2, and interms of valence electrons,\nhow many bonding valenceelectrons do we have?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: All right, what\nabout anti-bonding?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Two.OK, good.So again, we're going to\nsee that we have abonding order of 0.So we would not predict\nto see a b e 2 bond.So what we see is a bond order\nof 0, and again, the bond isvery, very weak.Essentially we're not going\nto see this, it's 9kilojoules per mole.All right.So, so far we've looked only\nat molecules that involveatoms that have only\ns orbitals in them.I'm sure you're thinking well,\nwhat do we do in the case of porbitals, and, in fact, we\ncan do the same thing.Again, we're going to take the\nlinear combination of those patomic orbitals and make what\nare called pi or some moresigma molecular orbitals.So let's look at the first case\nwhere we have either the2 p x or 2 p y type of orbitals\nthat we're combining.So they're the same shape,\nthis is the shape of theorbital or the shape of the wave\nfunction, and we can call", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.162}, {"text": "this either 2 p x a being\ncombined with 2 p x b, or wecould say since it's the same\nshape, it's 2 p y a beingcombined with 2 p y b.And in either case if we first\ntalk about constructiveinterference, what again we're\ngoing to see is that wherethese two orbitals come\ntogether, we're going to seeincreased wave function in\nthat area, so we sawconstructive interference.So again, we can name these\nmolecular orbitals and thesewe're going to call -- also to\npoint out there is now a bondaxis along this nodal plane,\nwhich is something we didn'tsee before when we were\ncombining the s orbitals.So when we go ahead and name\nthese, we're going to callthese pi orbitals.We'll call it either pi 2 p x,\nif we're combining the xorbitals, or pi 2 p y.The reason that I wanted to\npoint out this nodal planehere is because this is why\nit is called a pi orbital.Pi orbitals are a molecular\norbital that have a nodalplane through the bond axis.Remember this is our bond axis\nhere, and you can see there isthis area where the wave\nfunction is equal to zero allalong that plane, that's\na nodal plane.So that's why these\nare pi orbitalsinstead of sigma orbitals.So again, we can think about\nthe probability density interms of squaring the\nwave function.So now what it is that we're\nsquaring is if we're talkingabout x orbital, it's pi 2 p\nx squared, and this is justequal to the 2 p x a plus the 2\np x b all squared, or if wewrite out all of the terms we\nhave 2 p x a squared plus 2 px b squared, and then this term\nhere, and again, this isour interference term.In this case is it constructive\nor destructiveinterference?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Constructive\ninterference.We're seeing that the wave\nfunction's adding together and", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.225}, {"text": "giving us more wave function\nin the center here.All right.So we see constructive\ninterference, of course, wecan also see destructive\ninterference.So I changed the colors here\nto show that these are 2 porbitals with an opposite phase\nor an opposite sign.So what happens when we add a 2\np a and we subtract from ita 2 p x b, or the same with a 2\np y a subtracting a 2 p y b,is that we're actually going\nto cancel out the wavefunction in the center, so we\nnow have 2 nodal planes.So again, this is an\nanti-bonding orbital, and whatyou see is that there is now\nless electron density betweenthe two nuclei than there was\nwhen you had non-bonding.So we're going to call this the\nsigma 2 p x star, or ifwe're talking about the 2 p y\norbitals we'll call this thepi 2 p x star, and the\npi 2 p y star.And the pi star orbitals result\nfrom any time you havedestructive interference from\n2 p orbitals that are eitherthe p x or the p y.So now we can move on to an\nexample where we do, in fact,have to use some p orbitals,\nso this would be b 2.How many electrons\nare in boron?Five.I see some hands going up.There's five electrons So what\nyou'll notice here is that Ionly filled in 3 electrons.What do these electrons\nrepresent?STUDENT: Valence.PROFESSOR: Valence electrons.OK, sometimes you're going to\nbe asked to draw a molecularorbital diagram where you're\nasked to include allelectrons, and sometimes it\nwill specifically say onlyinclude valence electrons.That happens because of space\nissues that you were asked todo that, because you can always\nassume that all of thecore orbitals are already\ngoing to be filled.So, in this case, we're just\ndrawing the molecular orbital", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.202}, {"text": "diagram for the valence\nelectrons, so wehave three for each.And

asking where the 2\np z orbital is and we'll getto that soon once we need it.Let's just first fill in\nthis for the b 2 case.So we can start at the bottom,\ntwo electrons in sigma 2 s,two electrons in\nsigma 2 s star.Now we need to jump up to using\nthese pi orbitals, andwhat we're going to do is put\none electron into each of ourpi 2 p x and 2 p y orbitals.So again you can see as we're\nfilling up our molecularorbitals, we're using the exact\nsame principle we usedto fill up atomic orbitals.So let's think about what\nthe valence electronconfiguration is here.So now we're looking\nat the case of b 2.And what we're looking at is a\nvalence electron molecularorbital diagram, so let's\njust draw the electronconfiguration for the valence\norbitals, so that will besigma 2 s 2, sigma 2 s star

two in the sigma\n2 s, two in the sigma 2 sstar, and now we're going to\nfill one and one into each ofour pi 2 p x and 2 p y, but we\nstill have two electrons left,so what we're going to do is\ndouble up in terms of our 2 px and our 2 p y.So let's think about what this\nvalence electron configurationis for c 2.And again, I want you to have\npracticed drawing these out inthe form -- you always need to\nstart with the sigma and thenwrite the number\nof the orbital.So, sigma 2 s has two electrons,\nsigma 2 s star withtwo electrons, and now we have\nsigma 2 p x -- how manyelectrons here?STUDENT:

to see a\ndouble bond for a c 2 where wewould expect to see a -- double\nbond for c 2 and asingle bond for b 2.And that is, in fact, what we\ncan surmise if we look at the", "start": 2520.0, "heat":

of\nmolecules, but we know that asingle bond is always weaker\nthan a double bond, which isweaker than a triple bond.And obviously, no bond is the\nweakest of all is not bonding.All right.So let's look now at the case\nwhere we do have 2 p zorbitals that we're\ntalking about.So again, what we're talking\nabout is the linearcombination of atomic 2 p\norbitals, and now we'retalking about 2 p z.So if we have constructive\ninterference between the two,what we're going to see is our\nmolecular orbital lookssomething like this.Do you predict that this will\nbe a sigma or a pi orbital?STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: All right, I'm\nhearing a little of both, butI'm very encouraged to\nhear quite a fewpeople saying sigma.This is, in fact, a sigma\n2 p z orbital is whatthis orbital is called.The reason that it's sigma is\nif you look at the bondingaxis here, is that there\nis no nodal planealong the bonding axis.Also, it is cylindrically\nsymmetric around the bondingaxis, so this is how we know\nthat it's a sigma orbital.So some p orbitals form pi\nmolecular orbitals, and someform sigma p orbitals.Specifically, it's always the\nz that forms the sigmaorbital, and the reason is at\nleast at a minimum for thisclass we always define the\ninternuclear axis as the zaxis, so this is always the z\naxis, so it's always going tobe the 2 p z's that are coming\ntogether head-on.The reason that there is\nincreased electron densityhere is you can see that these\ntwo orbitals come together andconstructively interfere.", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.231}, {"text": "We can also talk about\nanti-bonding orbitals where wehave destructive interference.So instead, these would be\ncanceling out wave functionsbetween the two, so we would end\nup with a nodal plane downthe center.Would

axis that we'recalling that a pi orbital.So this is still a\nsigma -- it's asigma 2 p z star orbital.We have destructive\ninterference here.So now let's look at an example\nwhere we talk aboutusing these 2 p z orbitals,\nso let's look at oxygen.So the first thing I want to\npoint out is that the 2 p z,the sigma 2 p z is even lower in\nenergy than the pi orbitalshere, and the anti-bonding

you should make sureyou do counting, I apologize.So we need to fill all the\nway up to the pi 2 p x,and the pi 2 p y.All right, so the bonding order,\nyou're correct, shouldbe 2, if we subtract
