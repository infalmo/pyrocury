[{"text": "GILBERT STRANG: OK well,\nhere we're at the beginning.And that I think it's worth\nthinking about what we know.Calculus.Differential equations is the\nbig application of calculus,so it's kind of interesting to\nsee what part of calculus, whatinformation and what\nideas from calculus,actually get used in\ndifferential equations.And I'm going to\nshow you what I see,and it's not everything\nby any means,it's some basic ideas, but not\nall the details you learned.So I'm not saying\nforget all those,but just focus on what matters.OK.So the calculus you\nneed is my topic.And the first thing\nis, you really doneed to know basic derivatives.The derivative of x to\nthe n, the derivativeof sine and cosine.Above all, the derivative of e\nto the x, which is e to the x.The derivative of e to\nthe x is e to the x.That's the wonderful equation\nthat is solved by e to the x.Dy dt equals y.We'll have to do more with that.And then the inverse function\nrelated to the exponentialis the logarithm.With that special\nderivative of 1/x.OK.But you know those.Secondly, out of those\nfew specific facts,you can create the derivatives\nof an enormous arrayof functions using\nthe key rules.The derivative of f\nplus g is the derivativeof f plus the derivative of g.Derivative is a\nlinear operation.The product rule fg\nprime plus gf prime.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.107}, {"text": "The quotient rule.Who can remember that?And above all, the chain rule.The derivative of this--\nof that chain of functions,that composite function is the\nderivative of f with respectto g times the derivative\nof g with respect to x.That's really-- that\nit's chains of functionsthat really blow open the\nfunctions or we can deal with.OK.And then the\nfundamental theorem.So the fundamental theorem\ninvolves the derivativeand the integral.And it says that one is the\ninverse operation to the other.The derivative of the integral\nof a function is this.Here is y and the\nintegral goes from 0to x I don't care what\nthat dummy variable is.I can-- I'll change that\ndummy variable to t.Whatever.I don't care.[? ET ?] to show\nthe dummy variable.The x is the limit\nof integration.I won't discuss that\nfundamental theorem,but it certainly is\nfundamental and I'll use it.Maybe that's better.I'll use the fundamental\ntheorem right away.So-- but remember what it says.It says that if you take a\nfunction, you integrate it,you take the derivative, you\nget the function back again.OK can I apply\nthat to a really--I see this as a key example\nin differential equations.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And let me show you the\nfunction I have in mind.The function I have in\nmind, I'll call it y,is the interval from 0 to t.So it's a function\nof t then, time, It'sthe integral of this,\ne to the t minus s.Some function.That's a remarkable\nformula for the solutionto a basic\ndifferential equation.So with this, that\nsolves the equation dydt equals y plus q of t.So when I see that equation\nand we'll see it againand we'll derive this\nformula, but now Iwant to just use the\nfundamental theorem of calculusto check the formula.What as we created-- as we\nderive the formula-- wellit won't be wrong because\nour derivation will be good.But also, it would\nbe nice, I justthink if you plug that in,\nto that differential equationit's solved.OK so I want to take\nthe derivative of that.That's my job.And that's why I do it here\nbecause it uses all the rules.OK to take that\nderivative, I noticethe t is appearing there\nin the usual place,and it's also\ninside the integral.But this is a simple function.I can take e to the\nt-- I'm going to take eto the t out of the--\noutside the integral.e to the t.So I have a function t\ntimes another function of t.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "I'm going to use\nthe product ruleand show that the\nderivative of that productis one term will be y and\nthe other term will be q.Can I just apply the product\nrule to this functionthat I've pulled out of a\nhat, but you'll see it again.OK so it's a product\nof this times this.So the derivative dy dt\nis-- the product rulesays take the derivative\nof [INAUDIBLE] thatis e to the [INAUDIBLE].Plus, the first thing times\nthe derivative of the second.Now I'm using the product rule.It just-- you have to notice\nthat e to the t came twicebecause it is there and\nits derivative is the same.OK now, what's the\nderivative of that?Fundamental theorem of calculus.We've integrated something, I\nwant to take its derivative,so I get that something.I get e to the minus tq of t.That's the fundamental theorem.Are you good with that?So let's just look\nand see what we have.First term was exactly y.Exactly what is\nabove because whenI took the derivative\nof the first guy,the f it didn't change\nit, so I still have y.What have I-- what\ndo I have here?E to the t times e to\nthe minus t is one.So e to the t cancels\ne to the minus tand I'm left with q\nof t Just what I want.So the two terms\nfrom the product ruleare the two terms in the\ndifferential equation.", "start":

use\nof the fundamental theorem.OK one more topic\nof calculus we need.And here we go.So it involves the\ntangent line to the graph.This tangent to the graph.So it's a straight line and what\nwe need is y of t plus delta t.That's taking any\nfunction, maybeyou'd rather I just\ncalled the function f.A function at a point\na little beyond t,is approximately\nthe function at tplus the correction because\nit-- plus a delta f, right?A delta f.And what's the delta\nf approximately?It's approximately delta t\ntimes the derivative at t.That-- there's a lot of\nsymbols on that line,but it expresses the most basic\nfact of differential calculus.If I put that f of t on\nthis side with a minus sign,then I have delta f.If I divide by that delta\nt, then the same ruleis saying that this is\napproximately df dt.That's a fundamental\nidea of calculus,that the derivative\nis quite close.At the point t-- the\nderivative at the point tis close to delta f\ndivided by delta t.", "start":

slope.Just draw a picture.So I'm drawing a picture here.So let me draw a\ngraph of-- oh there'sthe graph of e to the t.So it starts up with slope 1.Let me give it a\nlittle slope here.OK the tangent line,\nand of course itcomes down here Not below.So the tangent\nline is that line.That's the tangent line.That's this approximation to f.And you see as I-- here\nis t equals 0 let's say.And here's t equal delta t.And you see if I\ntake a big step,my line is far from the curve.And we want to get closer.So the way to get\ncloser is we haveto take into\naccount the bending.The curve is bending.What derivative tells\nus about bending?That is delta t squared\ntimes the second derivative.One half.It turns out a one\nhalf shows in there.So this is the term that\nchanges the tangent line,to a tangent parabola.It notices the\nbending at that point.The second derivative\nat that point.So it curves up.It doesn't follow it perfectly,\nbut as well-- much betterthan the other.So this is the line.Here is the parabola.And here is the function.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "The real one.OK.I won't review the theory there\nthat it pulls out that onehalf, but you could check it.Now finally, what if we\nwant to do even better?Well we need to take into\naccount the third derivativeand then the fourth\nderivative and so on,and if we get all\nthose derivatives then,all of them that means,\nwe will be at the functionbecause that's a nice\nfunction, e to the t.We can recreate that\nfunction from knowingits height, its\nslope, its bendingand all the rest of the terms.So there's a whole lot\nmore-- Infinitely many terms.That one over two-- the\ngood way to think of oneover two, one half, is one over\ntwo factorial, two times one.Because this is one\nover n factorial,times t to the\nnth, pretty small,times the nth derivative\nof the function.And keep going.That's called the Taylor\nseries named after Taylor.Kind of frightening at first.It's frightening because it's\ngot infinitely many terms.And the terms are getting\na little more comp--For most functions,\nyou really don't wantto compute the nth derivative.For e to the t, I don't mind\ncomputing the nth derivativebecause it's still e to the\nt, but usually that's-- thisisn't so practical.[INAUDIBLE] very practical.Tangent parabola,\nquite practical.Higher order terms, less--\nmuch less practical.But the formula is\nbeautiful because yousee the pattern, that's\nreally what mathematics", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "is about patterns,\nand here you'reseeing the pattern in\nthe higher, higher terms.They all fit that pattern and\nwhen you add up all the terms,if you have a nice function,\nthen the approximationbecomes perfect and you\nwould have equality.So to end this lecture,\napproximate to equal providedwe have a nice function.And those are the best functions\nof mathematics and exponentialis of course one of them.OK that's calculus.Well, part of calculus.Thank
