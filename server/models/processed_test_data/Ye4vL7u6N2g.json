It doesn't matter whatthe price is.Because there's no substitute\nfor that good.So if you wanted amount Q of\nthat good for any reason,you're always going to\nwant that amount Qno matter the price.So a perfectly inelastic good\nwould have no substitutes.So you'd always want\nQ no matter what.Can anyone think\nof an example?There's no perfectly inelastic\ngood in the world.But what sorts of goods?Yeah?AUDIENCE: Medicines.PROFESSOR: Medicines.Now, not necessarily\nall medicines.So give me an example of a\nmedicine which would be moreor less inelastic.So I don't even need\na medical name.What sort of treatments?AUDIENCE: Like heart\nattack maybe?PROFESSOR: Yeah, something which\nis sort of lifesaving.The best thing that we often use\nis insulin for diabetics.Diabetics without getting that\ninsulin to manage theirdiabetes will die.That seems like that's something\nwhere there's not awhole lot of substitutes.The substitute is dying.So basically that's\nwhere demand",

without it.And people would want less\nViagra if you charged a lotmore for it than if you\ncharged less for it.So elasticity is going to be\nabout substitutability.And that's going to determine\ninelastic demand.Now, what happens with inelastic\ndemand when there'sa supply shock?When supply increases,\nwhat happens?Well, in that case, there can\nnever be excess demand,because demand doesn't change.So all that happens is\nprice just increases.If there's inelastic demand,\nand there's a supply shock,then all that happens is an\nincrease in price and nochange in quantity.So with inelastic demand,\nquantity doesn't change for aprice increase.Price just goes up.From a supply shock, prices\njust goes up.Now, let's consider\nthe opposite.Let's look at Figure\n3-3 and think aboutperfectly elastic demand.Perfectly elastic demand is\ndemand where consumers,essentially, don't care\nabout the quantity.They just care about\nthe price.That is, there are infinitely\ngood substitutes.A perfectly elastically demanded\ngood would be onewhere there are, essentially,\nperfect substitutes.An inelastic good is where\nthere's no substitute.A perfectly elastic good would\nbe where there's perfectsubstitutes.Technically, if a good is\nperfectly elasticallydemanded, then you are\ncompletely indifferent betweenthat good and a substitute.Well, if you're

Orbit and Eclipse.And I go to the store, and\nthey're all pretty much thesame price.If Orbit was more than Eclipse,\nI just buy Eclipse.They're the same.They're minty gum.It doesn't make a

magic\ningredient got moreexpensive, so the supply\ncurve shifted up.Well, Eclipse could not respond\nby raising its price.Because I just switched\nto Orbit.Or we often think of McDonald's\nand Burger King.Now, they're less perfectsubstitutes, but pretty perfect.If McDonald's started charging\n$10 for a hamburger, youwouldn't go there anymore.You'd go to Burger King.So if there's a supply shock

with perfectly inelastic\ndemand, thequantity didn't change.With perfectly elastic demand,\nwe saw a big quantity change.So, more generally, what\ndetermines the quantity changein response to a price

money thatproducers make from selling\ntheir goods.Well, if a producer sells Q\ngoods at a price P, they makerevenues R. Revenues are the\nprice times the quantity.The amount of money a producer\nmakes when it sells goods, itsrevenues, this isn't\nits profits.We're not having profits.It's just the amount of money\nit makes, not the amount ofmoney it takes home at\nthe end of the day.I'm ignoring the cost\nof making the goods.The amount of total\nrevenues it makesis price times quantity.Well, we can then say that the\nchange in revenues withrespect to price is what?It's Q plus dQ, plus delta Q--\nlet me put it this way to makemy math clearer--plus P times delta Q over delta\nP. That's how revenueschange with respect to price.Or, in other words, plugging\nin from the elasticityformula, delta R over delta P\nequals Q times 1 plus epsilon.So, in other words, what this\nsays is that if you're aproducer, and you're trying to\ndecide whether to raise yourprice, whether that will\nincrease revenues, it alldepends on the elasticity.If the elasticity is between\n0 and minus 1,

going tolose money by raising\ntheir price.If they take the current level\nof Eclipse, for every pennythey raise, they'll\nlose money.For insulin, for every\npenny they raise,they'll make money.And then you might say well,\nthen how come the price ofinsulin isn't infinity\nand the price ofEclipse gum isn't zero?Well, that's what we'll talk\nabout in a few weeks.Because it also depends on the\ncosts of producing it.But at the end of the day,\nthat's what's going todetermine the money that's made\nby producers when theychange their prices.Questions about that?OK.So now, that's how we think\nabout the shapeof supply and demand.The shape of supply and demand\nis determined by theseelasticities.So now we have to get into OK,\nwell, where do we get theseelasticities from?And that is the main topic of\nempirical economics which isestimating these kinds of\nelasticities, estimating thesetypes of elasticities.So one of the first distinctions\nI drew in thelectures is between theoretical\neconomics andempirical economics.Theoretical economics can tell\nus this is what a graph lookslike and supply and demand.Theoretical economics can't\nreally tell us how big, forexample,

model.We actually need to bring data\nto bear on the question.And this is very difficult.Because here we face the\nfundamental conundrum facingthe empirical economist which\nis distinguishing causationfrom correlation.And the whole guts of empirical\neconomics is allabout this question,\ndistinguishing causation fromcorrelation.The classic story that\nillustrates this, it's due tomy colleague, Frank Fisher,\nfrom a textbook many yearsago, was the story of in ancient\nRussia there was acholera outbreak, and many\npeople were dying.So the government decided to\nsend doctors out to try tosolve the problem.And where there were\nmore people sick,they sent more doctors.Well, the peasants said,\nwait a second.We observe that where there's\nmore doctors, more people aredying from cholera.So the doctors must be\ncausing the cholera.So they rose up and killed\nthe doctors.The peasants confused causation\nwith correlation.They thought that the fact that\nyou saw more people dyingwhere there's more doctors\nmeant that doctors werecausing the disease.Clearly that's wrong.That's why they were peasants.But it's not just peasants\nthat make this mistake.For example, in 1988, Harvard\nUniversity, our illustriousneighbor to the south,\nI guess, west,east, I don't know.Which way is Harvard?I don't know directions,\ndown the street.A Harvard University dean\nconducted an

dean confusing\ncausation with correlation?What did the dean get wrong in\ndrawing that conclusion?Yeah?AUDIENCE: What had probably\nhappened is the students whogot worse scores realized that\nthey

another excellent\nexample of confusing causationwith correlation.And that's another example.Another example I like quite\na lot is studies ofbreastfeeding.There are numbers of studies of\nbreastfeeding, especiallyin developing countries, where\nthey found that the longerchildren were breastfed\nthe sicker they were.So they concluded thatbreastfeeding was bad for kids.Well, that's

issomething which shifts\nsupply but does not,itself, affect demand.And the best example of this\nthat we use in economics, agreat example, is government\npolicy which comes along andchanges the supply conditions\nfor a good.So, for example, let's think\nabout a tax on pork.So if you go to Figure 3-5,\nimagine the government camealong and taxed pork.The government comes along\nand taxes

it\non the diagram.But you see where that dashed\nline at $3.30 intersects S2,that's way to the left.Quantity is going to fall\na ton in this market.When quantity falls, the\ngovernment is going to raise alot less money.Because the government\nraises $1.05 on everyunit sold at the end.So if the government taxes\nvery elastically demandedgoods, it's going to\nraise less money.If it taxes

are relatively\ninelastic.The elasticity is around\nminus 0.5.So the government will actually\nraise money byraising the cigarette tax.Those of us, as good liberals,\nthink we should tax yachts.Let's tax yachts.Only rich guy have yachts.The problem is yachts areincredibly elastically demanded.So you raise a lot less money\ntaxing yachts than you think.Because guys buy fewer yachts,\nand you don't raise as muchmoney as you think you would.You still raise some, and it\nstill may be worth it.But you raise less\nthan you think.So that's one sort of\nobservation about this.It's basically how much

a constantelasticity curve.Actually, I've done something\nhere which is logicallyinconsistent.This curve is linear which means\nit can't be constantelasticity.If it's constant elasticity,\nit would have to curve.So what I've estimated here\nis a local elasticity.I have estimated the elasticityaround that price change.But the elasticity, if this\ncurve is true, would bedifferent at different\npoints on this curve.If the elasticity is going to\nbe constant all over thecurve, and you're going to do\na constant elasticity ofdemand, that's going to\nbe a curve that bends,not a

it's local enough, it\ndoesn't really matter.But, for a broad change, it will\nmatter what the shape ofthe curve is.Good point.Other questions?OK.Let me then turn to another\nproblem we facein empirical economics.So this is an example of a\nproblem we're facing inempirical economics.Let me turn to an example of\nanother problem we face inempirical economics estimating\nelasticities.It is that individuals often\nchoose the price they face.Individuals, typically, often\ndon't just face a price that'sgiven to them.And then you can say, OK,\nthey're given a price, and wesee how they respond.They often choose the\nprice they face.Let me explain what\nI mean by that.A classic example of an\nelasticity that matters a lotfor policies is the elasticity\nof demand for medical care,the elasticity of demand\nfor medical care.That is how much less medical\ncare will you use if you haveto pay for it?So, for example, most of us have\ninsurance through MIT ormaybe through our parents.And the way health insurance\nworks is you pay a certainamount per month or your parents\ndo, and, in return,that health insurance covers the\ncost of your medical care,most of it.But, typically, you have\nto pay some of it.So how many people have\ngone to the doctor inthe last six months?Did you have to pay something?How much did you pay?Did you pay a copayment?No?None of you?Yeah.How much did you pay?AUDIENCE: I think like $20.PROFESSOR: $20, $10, $5, that's\nwhat's called thecopayment, or $0.Most insurance these days has\nwhat's called copayments.A copayment is what you pay\nwhen you go to the doctor.Insurance picks up the\nrest. You don't know.You didn't know how much the\nwhole doctor visit cost. Youjust went, you gave\nthem your card.They said your copayment\nis $20.You gave them $20.You don't know.The visit might have cost $100,\n$200, $500, $1,000.", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.265}, {"text": "You don't know.Your insurer picks up the rest.\nYou pay the copayment.Copayments are rapidly on the\nrise in health insurance.There's a rapid rise\nin copayments.Increasingly, insurers are\nsaying, look, health carecosts are out of control.One way we're going to combat\nthem is by making people bearmore of the cost\nthat they use.I could go on forever about\nhow I'm a health careeconomist. I could go on about\nhealth care forever.But just to fix ideas on why\nthis is an issue, in 1950, theUS economy spent 5% of our gross\ndomestic product, 5% ofour size of the economy\nwent to health care.Today it's 17%.By 2075, it's projected\nto be 40%.That is of every dollar that's\nmade in America, $0.40 will goto medical care.By 100 years later,\nit's about 100%.Literally, if we do nothing,\nthe entire economy will behealth care.Obviously, that can't happen.We've got to deal with this.And one way that insurers and\nsome policy makers are sayingwe need to deal with this is we\nneed to make consumers bearmore of the costs of\ntheir medical care.We need to make consumers pay\nmore when they go to thedoctor, so that they understand\nthe consequences oftheir decision.Well, if we're going to do that,\na key question we needto know is well, does it\naffect their behavior?If we make consumers pay more,\nand it doesn't at all affecttheir demand for medical care--\nit's just a tax onthem, essentially--then that's different than if\nit causes them to use lessmedical care.It may be good, may be bad.We'll come back to that.But the key empirical question\nis what is the elasticity ofdemand for medical care?If you pay $20 and you pay $0,\nhow much less like are you touse the doctor when you pay $20\nversus when you pay $0.Well, we can all introspect\nthis and think about it.But, in fact, to answer this we\nhave to go to the data andask, well, what's\nthe difference?So people, for many years,\nwent to the data.And they said, look, there's all\nsorts of differences outthere across people and what\nthey pay for their copayments.Some people have insurance where\nthey pay nothing, some", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.276}, {"text": "where they have $20.Some people have what they call\nhigh-deductible plans.A deductible plan is where you\npay the full cost of yourvisits until you reach\nsome limit.So a $2000 deductible plan will\nbe one where you pay allof your medical costs until\nyou've spent $2,000.It's a big copayment.So we look across those people,\nand people did.And they found, look, the people\nthat have plans wherethey spend more for health care,\nwhere they have a highcopayment, use a lot less health\ncare than where theydon't have to spend anything.The elasticity of demand\nlooks very, very high.What is wrong with\nthose studies?What is wrong with the\nconclusion those people drew?They drew it by comparing people\nwho had plans wherethey paid a lot to go to the\ndoctor, and therefore use alot less care to people who\ndidn't pay anything when theywent to the doctor and\nused a lot more care.I pick the $20 person, because\nI picked on you already.AUDIENCE: Probably they chose\nto have a high-deductibleplan, because they don't often\ngo to the doctor already.PROFESSOR: The rational choice,\nif you're young andhealthy, for almost everyone in\nthis room, is going to be avery high-deductible,\nhigh copayment plan.Because it will cost you less\nmoney, because the insurer isshifting the money to you.But you don't use the\ndoctor anyway.So who cares?So the healthier people are\ngoing to choose the planswhere they pay more.So, of course, you're going to\nfind in the plans where peoplepay more they use less\nmedical care.But is it because they're paying\nmore, or is it becausehealthy guys choose\nthose plans?It's causation versus\ncorrelation.We don't know.Well, how can we figure\nthat out?Well, if we were doctors, what\nwe'd do-- real doctors, not adoctor like me, a real doctor,\na medical doctor--what we'd do is we'd run\na randomized trial.So if doctors want to figure\nout whether a drug works or", "start": 2400.0, "heat": 0.542}, {"text": "not, they don't just look at\nguys who take

let's be clear.Remember what elasticity is.That delta Q over Q.
