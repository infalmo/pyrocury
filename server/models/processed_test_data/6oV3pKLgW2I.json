So,in particular, we assume that\nthe sample points are equallylikely, which means that every\nelement of the sample spacehas the same probability\nequal to 1 over N.And then we are interested in a\nsubset of the sample space,call it A. And that\nsubset consistsof a number of elements.Let the cardinality of that\nsubset be equal to little n.And then to find the probability\nof that set, allwe need to do is to add the\nprobabilities of theindividual elements.There's little n elements, and\neach one has probability oneover capital N. And\nthat's the answer.So this means that to solve\nproblems in this context, allthat we need to be able to do\nis to figure out the numbercapital N and to figure out\nthe number little n.Now, if somebody gives you a set\nby just giving you a listand gives you another set,\nagain, giving you a list, it'seasy to count there element.You just count how much\nthere is on the list.But sometimes the sets are\ndescribed in some moreimplicit way, and we may have to\ndo a little bit more work.There's various tricks that areinvolved in counting properly.And the most common\none is to--when you consider a set of\npossible outcomes, to describethe construction of those\npossible outcomes through asequential process.So think of a probabilistic\nexperiment that involves anumber of stages, and in each\none of the stages there's anumber of possible choices\nthat there may be.The overall experiment consists\nof carrying out allthe stages to the end.And the number of points in the\nsample space is how manyfinal outcomes there can be in\nthis multi-stage experiment.So in this picture we have an\nexperiment in which of the", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.109}, {"text": "first stage we have\nfour choices.In the second stage, no matter\nwhat happened in the firststage, the way this is drawn\nwe have three choices.No matter whether we ended up\nhere, there, or there, we havethree choices in the\nsecond stage.And then there's a third stage\nand at least in this picture,no matter what happened in the\nfirst two stages, in the thirdstage we're going to have\ntwo possible choices.So how many leaves are there\nat the end of this tree?That's simple.It's just the product of\nthese three numbers.The number of possible leaves\nthat we have out there is 4times 3 times 2.Number of choices at each stage\ngets multiplied, andthat gives us the number\nof overall choices.So this is the general rule, the\ngeneral trick that we aregoing to use over and over.So let's apply it to some very\nsimple problems as a warm up.How many license plates can you\nmake if you're allowed touse three letters and then\nfollowed by four digits?At least if you're dealing with\nthe English alphabet, youhave 26 choices for\nthe first letter.Then you have 26 choices\nfor the second letter.And then 26 choices for\nthe third letter.And then we start the digits.We have 10 choices for the first\ndigit, 10 choices forthe second digit, 10 choices for\nthe third, 10 choices forthe last one.Let's make it a little more\ncomplicated, suppose thatwe're interested in license\nplates where no letter can berepeated and no digit\ncan be repeated.So you have to use different\nletters, different digits.How many license plates\ncan you make?OK, let's choose the\nfirst letter,and we have 26 choices.Now, I'm ready to choose my\nsecond letter, how many", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.131}, {"text": "choices do I have?I have 25, because I already\nused one letter.I have the 25 remaining letters\nto choose from.For the next letter,\nhow many choices?Well, I used up two of\nmy letters, so Ionly have 24 available.And then we start with the\ndigits, 10 choices for thefirst digit, 9 choices for the\nsecond, 8 for the third, 7 forthe last one.All right.So, now, let's bring some\nsymbols in a related problem.You are given a set that\nconsists of n elements andyou're supposed to take\nthose n elements andput them in a sequence.That is to order them.Any possible ordering of those\nelements is called apermutation.So for example, if we have the\nset 1, 2, 3, 4, a possiblepermutation is the\nlist 2, 3, 4, 1.That's one possible\npermutation.And there's lots of possible\npermutations, of course, thequestion is how many\nare there.OK, let's think about building\nthis permutation by choosingone at a time.Which of these elements goes\ninto each one of these slots?How many choices for the number\nthat goes into thefirst slot or the elements?Well, we can choose any one of\nthe available elements, so wehave n choices.Let's say this element goes\nhere, having used up thatelement, we're left with n minus\n1 elements and we canpick any one of these and bring\nit into the second slot.So here we have n choices, here\nwe're going to have nminus 1 choices, then how\nmany we put there willhave n minus 2 choices.And you go down until the end.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.32}, {"text": "What happens at this point\nwhen you are topick the last element?Well, you've used n minus of\nthem, there's only oneleft in your bag.You're forced to use that one.So the last stage, you're going\nto have only one choice.So, basically, the number of\npossible permutations is theproduct of all integers\nfrom n down to one, orfrom one up to n.And there's a symbol that we\nuse for this number, it'scalled n factorial.So n factorial is the number of\npermutations of n objects.The number of ways that you can\norder n objects that aregiven to you.Now, a different equation.We have n elements.Let's say the elements\nare 1, 1,2, up to n.And it's a set.And we want to create\na subset.How many possible subsets\nare there?So speaking of subsets means\nlooking at each one of theelements and deciding whether\nyou're going to put it in tosubsets or not.For example, I could choose\nto put 1 in, but 2 I'm notputting it in, 3 I'm not putting\nit in, 4 I'm puttingit, and so on.So that's how you\ncreate a subset.You look at each one of the\nelements and you say, OK, I'mgoing to put it in the subset,\nor I'm not going to put it.So think of these as consisting\nof stages.At each stage you look at\none element, and youmake a binary decision.Do I put it in the\nsubset, or not?So therefore, how many\nsubsets are there?Well, I have two choices\nfor the first element.Am I going to put in\nthe subset, or not?I have two choices for the\nnext element, and so on.For each one of the elements,\nwe have two choices.So the overall number of choices\nis 2 to the power n.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.35}, {"text": "So, conclusion--the number of subsets, often n\nelement set, is 2 to the n.So in particular, if we take n\nequal to 1, let's check thatour answer makes sense.If we have n equal to one, how\nmany subsets does it have?So we're dealing with\na set of just one.What are the subsets?One subset is this one.Do we have other subsets\nof the one element set?Yes, we have the empty set.That's the second one.These are the two possible\nsubsets ofthis particular set.So 2 subsets when n is equal to\n1, that checks the answer.All right.OK, so having gone so far, we\ncan do our first example now.So we are given a die\nand we're goingto roll it 6 times.OK, let's make some assumptions\nabout the rolls.Let's assume that the rolls are\nindependent, and that thedie is also fair.So this means that the\nprobability of any particularoutcome of the die rolls--for example, so we have 6 rolls,\none particular outcomecould be 3,3,1,6,5.So that's one possible\noutcome.What's the probability\nof this outcome?There's probability 1/6 that\nthis happens, 1/6 that thishappens, 1/6 that this\nhappens, and so on.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.422}, {"text": "So the probability that\nthe outcome is thisis 1/6 to the sixth.What did I use to come\nup with this answer?I used independence, so I\nmultiplied the probability ofthe first roll gives me a 2,\ntimes the probability that thesecond roll gives me\na 3, and so on.And then I used the assumption\nthat the die is fair, so thatthe probability of 2 is\n1/6, the probably of 3is 1/6, and so on.So if I were to spell it out,\nit's the probability that weget the 2 in the first roll,\ntimes the probability of 3 inthe second roll, times the\nprobability of the5 in the last roll.So by independence, I can\nmultiply probabilities.And because the die is fair,\neach one of these numbers is1/6 to the sixth.And so the same calculation\nwould apply no matter whatnumbers I would put in here.So all possible outcomes\nare equally likely.Let's start with this.So since all possible outcomes\nare equally likely to find ananswer to a probability\nquestion, if we're dealingwith some particular event, so\nthe event is that all rollsgive different numbers.That's our event A. And our\nsample space is some setcapital omega.We know that the answer is going\nto be the cardinality ofthe set A, divided by the\ncardinality of the set omega.So let's deal with the\neasy one first.How many elements are there\nin the sample space?How many possible outcomes\nare there when youroll a dice 6 times?You have 6 choices for\nthe first roll.You have 6 choices for the\nsecond roll

this checks\nwith this.We have 6 to the sixth outcomes,\neach one has thismuch probability,\nso the overallprobability is equal to one.Right?So the probability of an\nindividual outcome is one overhow many possible outcomes\nwe have, which is this.All right.So how about the numerator?We are interested in outcomes\nin which the numbers that weget are all different.So what is an outcome in which\nthe numbers are all different?So the die has 6 faces.We roll it 6 times.We're going to get 6\ndifferent numbers.This means that we're going to\nexhaust all the possiblenumbers, but they can appear\nin any possible sequence.So an outcome that makes this\nevent happen is a list of thenumbers from 1 to 6,\nbut arranged insome arbitrary order.So the possible outcomes that\nmake event A happen are justthe permutations of the\nnumbers from 1 to 6.One possible outcome that makes\nour events to happen--it would be this.Here we have 6 possible numbers,\nbut any other list ofthis kind in which none\nof the numbers isrepeated would also do.So number of outcomes that make\nthe event happen is thenumber of permutations\nof 6 elements.So it's 6 factorial.And so the final answer is\ngoing to be 6 factorialdivided by 6 to the sixth.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.4}, {"text": "All right, so that's a typical\nway that's one solves problemsof this kind.We know how to count\ncertain things.For

once more a\nset with n elements.We already know how many subsets\nthat set has, but nowwe would be interested in\nsubsets that have exactly kelements in them.So we start with our big set\nthat has n elements, and wewant to construct a subset\nthat has k elements.Out of those n I'm\ngoing to choose kand put them in there.In how many ways\ncan I do this?More concrete way of thinking\nabout this

person\ncommittee.How many 5 person committees\nare possible if you'restarting with 100 people?So that's what we\nwant to count.How many k element subsets\nare there?We don't yet know the answer,\nbut

the second person\nin the committee.That's the third person in\nthe committee and so on.So in how many ways\ncan we do this?Out of these n, we want to\nchoose just k of them and putthem in slots.One

people, so I have nminus 2 choices here.And this keeps going on.Well, what is going to\nbe the last number?Is it's n minus k?Well, not really.I'm starting subtracting numbers\nafter the second one,so by the end I will have\nsubtracted k minus 1.So that's how many choices I\nwill have for the last person.So this is the number\nof ways--the product of these numbers\nthere gives me the number of",

OK.So are we in the setting\nof discreteuniform probability laws?When we toss a coin multiple\ntimes, is it the case that alloutcomes are equally likely?All sequences are\nequally likely?That's the case if you\nhave a fair coin--that all sequences are\nequally likely.But if your coin is not fair,\nof course, heads/heads isgoing to have a different\nprobability than tails/tails.If your coin is biased towards\nheads, then heads/heads isgoing to be more likely.So we're not quite in\nthe uniform setting.Our overall sample space, omega,\ndoes not have equallylikely elements.Do we care about that?Not necessarily.All the action now happens\ninside the event B that we are", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.778}, {"text": "told has occurred.So we have our big sample\nspace, omega.Elements of that sample space\nare not equally likely.We are told that a certain\nevent B occurred.And inside that event B, we're\nasked to find the conditionalprobability that A has\nalso occurred.Now here's the lucky thing,\ninside the event B, alloutcomes are equally likely.The outcomes inside B are the\nsequences of 10 tosses thathave exactly 3 heads.Every 3-head sequence has\nthis probability.So the elements of\nB are equallylikely with each other.Once we condition on the event\nB having occurred, whathappens to the probabilities\nof the different outcomesinside here?Well, conditional probability\nlaws keep the same proportionsas the unconditional ones.The elements of B were equally\nlikely when we started, sothey're equally likely once we\nare told that B has occurred.So to do with this problem, we\nneed to just transport us tothis smaller universe and think\nabout what's happeningin that little universe.In that little universe,\nall elements ofB are equally likely.So to find the probability of\nsome subset of that set, weonly need to count the\ncardinality of B, and countthe cardinality of A.\nSo let's do that.Number of outcomes in B--in how many ways can we get\n3 heads out of 10 tosses?", "start": 2280.0, "heat": 0.781}, {"text": "That's the number we considered\nbefore, andit's 10 choose 3.This is the number of\n3-head sequenceswhen you have 10 tosses.Now let's look at the event A.\nThe event A is that the first2 tosses where heads, but we're\nliving now inside thisuniverse B. Given that B\noccurred, how many elementsdoes A have in there?In how many ways can A happen\ninside the B universe.If you're told that the\nfirst 2 were heads--sorry.So out of the outcomes in B that\nhave 3 heads, how manystart with heads/heads?Well, if it starts with\nheads/heads, then the onlyuncertainty is the location\nof the third head.So we started with heads/heads,\nwe're going tohave three heads, the question\nis, where is that third headgoing to be.It has eight possibilities.So slot 1 is heads, slot 2 is\nheads, the third heads can beanywhere else.So there's 8 possibilities\nfor where the thirdhead is going to be.OK.So what we have counted here is\nreally the cardinality of Aintersection B, which is out of\nthe elements in B, how manyof them make A happen, divided\nby the cardinality of B.

It's A intersection B andcompare it with the total number\nof elements in the setB. Did I write it the\nopposite way?Yes.So this is 8 over 10 choose 3.OK.So we're going to close with a\nmore difficult problem now.OK.This business of n choose k has\nto do with starting with aset and picking a subset\nof k elements.Another way of thinking of that\nis that we start with aset with n elements and you\nchoose a subset that has k,which means that there's n\nminus k that are left.Picking a subset is the same as\npartitioning our set intotwo pieces.Now let's generalize this\nquestion and start countingpartitions in general.Somebody gives you a set\nthat has n elements.Somebody gives you also\ncertain numbers--n1, n2, n3, let's say,\nn4, where thesenumbers add up to n.And you're asked to partition\nthis set into four subsetswhere each one of the subsets\nhas this particular", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.372}, {"text": "cardinality.So you're asking to cut it into\nfour pieces, each onehaving the prescribed\ncardinality.In how many ways can we\ndo this partitioning?n choose k was the answer when\nwe partitioned in two pieces,what's the answer\nmore generally?For a concrete example of a\npartition, you have your 52card deck and you deal, as in\nbridge, by giving 13 cards toeach one of the players.Assuming that the dealing is\ndone fairly and with a wellshuffled deck of cards, every\nparticular partition of the 52cards into four hands, that is\nfour subsets of 13 each,should be equally likely.So we take the 52 cards and we\npartition them into subsets of13, 13, 13, and 13.And we assume that all possible\npartitions, allpossible ways of dealing the\ncards are equally likely.So we are again in a setting\nwhere we can use counting,because all the possible\noutcomes are equally likely.So an outcome of the experiment\nis the hands thateach player ends up getting.And when you get the cards in\nyour hands, it doesn't matterin which order that\nyou got them.It only matters what cards\nyou have on you.So it only matters which subset\nof the cards you got.All right.So what's the cardinality of\nthe sample space in thisexperiment?So let's do it for the concrete\nnumbers that we havefor the problem of partitioning\n52 cards.So think of dealing as follows--\nyou shuffle the deckperfectly, and then you take the\ntop 13 cards and give themto one person.In how many possible hands are\nthere for that person?", "start": 2640.0, "heat": 0.521}, {"text": "Out of the 52 cards, I choose 13\nat random and give them tothe first person.Having done that, what\nhappens next?I'm left with 39 cards.And out of those 39 cards, I\npick 13 of them and give themto the second person.Now I'm left with 26 cards.Out of those 26, I choose 13,\ngive them to the third person.And for the last person there\nisn't really any choice.Out of the 13, I have to give\nthat person all 13.And that number is\njust equal to 1.So we don't care about it.All right.So next thing you do is to write\ndown the formulas forthese numbers.So, for example, here you\nwould have 52 factorial,divided by 13 factorial,\ntimes 39factorial, and you continue.And then there are nice\ncancellations that happen.This 39 factorial is going to\ncancel the 39 factorial thatcomes from there, and so on.After you do the cancellations\nand all the algebra, you'releft with this particular\nanswer, which is the number ofpossible partitions of 52 cards\ninto four players whereeach player gets exactly\n13 hands.If you were to generalize this\nformula to the setting that wehave here, the more general\nformula is--you have n factorial, where n is\nthe number of objects thatyou are distributing, divided\nby the product of thefactorials of the--OK, here I'm doing it for\nthe case where we splitit into four sets.So that would be the answer when\nwe partition a set intofour subsets of prescribed\ncardinalities.And you can guess how that\nformula would generalize if", "start": 2760.0, "heat": 0.403}, {"text": "you want to split it into\nfive sets or six sets.OK.So far we just figured out the\nsize of the sample space.Now we need to look at our\nevent, which is the event thateach player gets an ace, let's\ncall that event A.
