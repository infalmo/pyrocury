world, although they,alas, don't seem to be\ncoming down to theBoston area very soon.If you go to a concert\nfrom the KodoDrummers--and you should--and if you're no longer young,\nyou'll want to bring earplugs.Because, as we humans get\nolder the dynamic rangecontrol in our inner ear tends\nto be less effective.So that's why a person of my age\nmight find some piece ofmusic excruciatingly loud,\nwhereas you'llthink it's just fine.Because you have better\nautomatic gain control.Just like in any kind of\ncommunication device there's acontrol on how intense\nthe sound gets.Ah, but I go off on a sidebar.Many of you have looked\nat me in astonishmentas I drink my coffee.And you have undoubtedly have\nbeen saying to yourself, youknow, Winston doesn't look like\na professional

tospend a minute or two in the\nbeginning talking about thelay of the land.And then we'll race through\nsome material on nearestneighbor learning.And then we'll finish up\nwith the

it's too latein the semester to get\nback on track.All right.So here's the story.Now the way we're going\nto look at learning isthere are two kinds.There's this kind, and\nthere's that kind.And we're going to talk a little\nbit about both kinds.The kind of the right is\nlearning based on observationsof regularity.And computers are particularly\ngood at this stuff.And amongst the things that\nwe'll

because that would\nmean that everything youlearned in 1801 is not good,\nbecause the same course wastaught 1910.So it has been around a while,\nbut it's extremely useful.And it's the first thing to try\nwhen you have a learningproblem, because it's\nthe simplest thing.And you always want to try the\nsimplest thing before you trysomething more complex that\nyou will be less likely tounderstand.So that's nearest neighbors\nand pattern recognitions.And the custodians of knowledge\nabout neural nets,well this is sort of an attempt\nto mimic biology.And I'll cast a lot of calumny\non that when we get down thereto talk about it.And finally, this is the gift\nof the theoreticians.So we in AI have invented some\nstuff, we've borrowed somestuff, we've stolen some stuff,\nwe've championed somestuff, and we've improved\nsome stuff.That's why our discussion of\nlearning will reach around allof these topics.So that's regularity\nbased learning.And you can think of\nthis as the branchof

and understand that wehave to go down this\nother branch, too.And down this other branch we\nfind learning ideas that arebased on constraint.And let's call this thehuman-like side of the picture.And we'll talk about ideas\nthat enable, for example,one-shot learning, where you\nlearn something definite fromeach experience.And we'll talk about explanation\nbased learning.By the way, do you learn\nby self explanation?I think so.I had an advisee once, who got\nnothing but A's and F's.And I said, what are the\nsubjects that you get A's in?And why don't you get A's\nin all of your subjects?And he said, oh, I get A's in\nthe subjects when I convincemyself the material is true.So the learning was a byproduct\nof self explanation,an important kind of learning.But alas, that's downstream.And what we're going to talk\nabout today is this paththrough the tree, nearest\nneighbor learning.And here's how it works,\nin general.Here's just a general picture\nof what we're talking about.When you think of pattern\nrecognition, or nearestneighbor based learning,\nyou've got some sort ofmechanism that generates\na vector of features.So we'll call this the\nfeature detector.",

covers.Suppose they arrived on an\nassembly line and some robotwants to sort them.How would it go about\ndoing that?Well it could easily\nuse the nearestneighbor sorting mechanism.So how would that work?Well here's how if would work.You would make some\nmeasurements.And it we'll just make some\nmeasurements in twodimensions.And one of those measurements\nmight be the total area,including the

any cover canhave, so we'll put\nit right here.And finally, we've got one\nmore of these guys.Oh yes, this one.1/2 the hole area, and\n1/2 the total area.So I don't know, let's see.Where will that go?Maybe about right here.So now our robot is looking on\nthe assembly line and it seessomething coming along, and\nit measures the area.And of course, there's noise.There's manufacturing\nvariability.So it won't be precisely\non top of anything.But suppose it's right there.Well it doesn't take any\ngenius human, human orcomputer, to figure out that\nthis must be one of

about it, if therewere only two, that would\nbe the boundary line.Anything south of the dotted\nline would be purple, andanything north would\nbe yellow.And now we can do this with\nall the points,

something.There's another way of thinking\nabout it that'sextremely important.And that is this.Suppose I come in with a brand\nnew cover, never before seen.And I only measure, well\nlet's say I

total\narea of the cell.And not the hole area, but\nmaybe the nucleus area.And maybe you might measure four\nor five other things, andput this thing in a high\ndimensional space.You can still

the\nvectors, well let's actuallymeasure the cosine of the angle\nbetween the vectors.Let's see how we can\ncalculate that.So we'll take the cosine of the\nangle between the vectors,we'll call it theta.That's going to be equal to the\nsum of the unknown valuestimes the article values.Those are just the values\nin various dimensions.And then we'll divide that\nby the magnitudeof the other

fast computation\nyou can see ifthese things are going to be\nin the same direction.By the way, if this vector here\nis actually identical toone of those articles, what\nwill the value be?Well then a

alone.What the devil do\nI mean by that?I mean that your cerebellum is\nso full of neurons that itdwarfs the rest of the brain.So if you exclude the\ncerebellum, you've got about10 to 10th neurons.And there about 10 to\nthe 11th neurons inthe cerebellum, alone.What's the cerebellum for?Motor control.Interesting.So we're a little short.Oh, but we forget, that's just\nthe number of neurons.We have to

happen\nin that case is that the--let's see, which values are\ngoing to be more important?The x values, right?The y values are spread out\nall over the place.So you'd like the spread of\nthe data to sort of be thesame in all the dimensions.So is there anything we\ncan do to arrangefor that to be true?Sure, we can just normalize\nthe data.So we can borrow from our\nstatistics course and say,well, let's see, we're\ninterested in x.And we know that the variance\nof x is equal to 1 over ntimes the sum of the values,\nminus the mean value squared.That's a measure of how much\nthe data spreads out.So now, instead of using x, we\ncan use x prime, which isequal to x over sigma.What's the variance of\nthat going to be?x over sigma sub x.Anybody see, instantaneously,\nwhat the variance ofthat's

non\nuniformity problem, the spreadproblem, is easy to handle.What about that other problem?No cake without flour?What if it turns out\nthat the data--you have two dimensions and the\nanswer,
