[{"text": "[SQUEAKING]\n[RUSTLING] [CLICKING]JONATHAN GRUBER:\nToday we're goingto start talking about what's\nunderneath the demand curve.So basically, what\nwe did last time,and what you did in\nsection on Fridayis talk about sort\nof the workhorsemodel of economics, which\nis supply and demand model.And we always start the class\nwith that, because that'sthe model in the course.But I think as any good sort\nof scientists and inquisitiveminds, you're probably\nimmediately asking, well,where do these supply and\ndemand curves come from?They don't just come\nout of thin air.How do we think about them?Where do they come from?And that's what we'll spend\nbasically the first 1/2of the course going through.And so we're going to start\ntoday with the demand curve,and the demand curve is\ngoing to come from howconsumers make choices, OK?And that will help us\ndrive the demand curve.Then we'll turn next\nto supply curve, whichwill come from how firms\nmake production decisions.But let's start with\nthe demand curve,and we're going to\nstart by talkingabout people's preferences, and\nthen the utility functions, OK?So our model of\nconsumer decision makingis going to be a model\nof utility maximization.That's going to be our\nfundamental-- remember,this course is all about\nconstrain maximization.Our model today is going to be\na model of utility maximization.And this model's going\nto have two components.There's going to be\nconsumer preferences, whichis what people want,\nand there's goingto be a budget constraint,\nwhich is what they can afford.And we're going to put\nthese two things together.We're going to maximize people's\nhappiness, or their choice--or their happiness\ngiven their preferences,subject to the budget\nconstraint they face.And that's going to be the\nconstraint maximizationexercise that actually,\nthrough the magic of economics,is going to yield\nthe demand curve,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "and yield a very sensible\ndemand curve that you'llunderstand intuitively.Now, so what we're going to\ndo is do this in three steps.Step one-- over the\nnext two lectures.Step one is we'll talk\nabout preferences, howdo we model people's tastes.We'll do that today.Step two is we'll talk\nabout how we translate thisto utility function,\nhow we mathematicallyrepresent people's preferences\nin utility function.We'll do that today as well.And then next time, we'll talk\nabout the budget constraintsthat people face.So today, we're going to\ntalk about the max demand.Next time we'll talk about\nthe budget constraint.That means today's\nlecture is quite fun.Today's lecture is about\nunconstrained choice.We're not going to worry\nat all about what you canafford, what anything costs.We're not going to worry\nabout what things cost.We're not going to worry\nabout what you can afford, OK?Today's the lecture where\nyou won the lottery, OK?You won the lottery.Money is no object.How do you think about\nwhat you want, OK?Next time, we'll say, well,\nyou didn't win the lottery.In fact, as we learn\nlater in the semester,no one wins the lottery.It's an incredibly bad deal.But next time, we'll impose\nthe budget constraints.But for today, we're just going\nto ignore that and talk aboutwhat do you want, OK?And to start this,\nwe're going to startwith a series of\npreference assumptions.A series-- remember, as\nI talked about last time,models rely on\nsimplifying assumptions.Otherwise, we could\nnever write down a model.It'll go on forever, OK?And the key question is,\nare those simplifyingassumptions sensible?Do they do violence to reality\nin a way which makes you notbelieve the model,\nor are they roughlyconsistent with reality\nin a way that allowsyou to go on with the model?OK?And we're going to pose three\npreference assumptions, whichI hope will not violate your\nsense of reasonableness.The first is completeness.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "What I mean by that is\nyou have preferencesover any set of goods\nyou might choose from.You might be indifferent.You might say, \"I\nlike A as much as B,\"but you can't say, \"I don't\ncare,\" or, \"I don't know.\"You can say, \"I don't care.\"That's indifference.You can't say, \"I don't know.\"You can't literally\nsay, \"I don'tknow how I feel about this.\"You might say you're\nindifferent to two things,but you won't say, \"I don't know\nhow I feel about something.\"That's completeness, OK?The second is the assumption\nwe've all become familiarwith since kindergarten\nmath, which is transitivity.If you prefer A to B and B\nto C, you prefer A to C, OK?That's kind of--I'm sure that's pretty clear.You've done this a\nlot in other classes.So these two are sort\nof standard assumptionsyou might make in\nany math class.The third assumption is the one\nwhere the economics comes in,which is the assumption\nof nonsatiationor the assumption\nof more is better.In this class, we\nwill assume moreis always better than less, OK?We'll assume more\nis better than less.Now, to be clear,\nwe're not goingto say that the\nnext unit makes youequally happy as the last unit.In fact, I'll talk about\nthat in a few minutes.Well, in fact, the next\nunit makes you less happy.But we will say you\nalways want more,that faced with the\nchance of more or less,you'll always be\nhappier with more, OK?And that's the nonsatiation\nassumption, OK?And I'll talk about that\nsome during the lecture,but that's sort of what's going\nto give our models their power.That's a sort of new\neconomics assumption.That's going to give-- beyond\nyour typical math assumptions--this is going to give our\nmodels their power, OK?So that's our assumptions.So armed with those,\nI want to startwith a graphical\nrepresentation of preferences.I want to graphically\nrepresent people's preferences,", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "and I'll do so through something\nwe call indifference curves.Indifference curves, OK?These are-- indifference curves\nare basically preference maps.Essentially, indifference\ncurves are graphical mapsof preferences, OK?So for example, suppose your\nparents gave you some moneyto begin the semester, and you\nspent that money on two things.Your parents are rich.They gave you tons of money.You spent your money on\ntwo things, buying pizzaor eating cookies, OK?So consider preferences\nbetween pizza and cookies.That's your two\nthings you can do.Once again, this is\na constrained model.Obviously, in life, you can do a\nmillion things with your money.But it turns out, if we consider\nthe contrast between doingtwo different things\nwith your money,you get a rich set\nof intuition that youcan apply to a much more\nmulti-dimensional decisioncase.So let's start with a two\ndimensional decision case.You've got your money.Either you can have pizza\nor you can have cookies, OK?Now, consider three choices, OK?Choice A is two\npizzas and one cookie.Choice B is one pizza\nand two cookies,and choice C is two\npizzas, two cookies.OK, that's the three\npackages I want to compare.And I am going to assume--and I'll mathematically\nrationalize in a few minutes--but for now, I'm\ngoing to assume youare indifferent between\nthese two packages.I'm going to assume\nyou're equallyhappy with two slices of pizza\nand one cookie or two cookiesand one slice of pizza, OK?I'm going to assume that.But I'm also going\nto assume you preferoption C to both of these.In fact, I'm going\nto assume that,because that is what more\nis better gives you, OK?So you're indifferent\nbetween this.This indifference doesn't come\nfrom any property I wrote up.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "That's an assumption.That's just-- for this\ncase, I'm assuming that.This comes to the third\nproperty I wrote up there.You prefer package C\nbecause more is alwaysbetter than less, OK?So now, let's graph\nyour preferences,and we do so in figure\n2-1, OK, in the handout.OK, so here's your\nindifference curve.So we've graphed on the\nx-axis your number of cookies,on the y-axis\nslices of pizza, OK?Now, you have-- we've graphed\nthe three choices I laid here,choice A, which is\ntwo slices of pizzaand one cookie, choice B,\nwhich is two cookies and oneslice of pizza, and choice\nC, which is two of both.And I've drawn on this graph\nyour indifference curves.The way your\nindifference curves looksis there's one indifference\ncurve between A and B,because those are the points\namong which you're indifferent.So what an indifference\ncurve representsis all combinations of\nconsumption among whichyou are indifferent.That's why we call it\nindifference curve.So an indifference\ncurve, which willbe sort of one of the big\nworkhorses of this course,an indifference curve represents\nall combinations along whichyou are in different.You're indifferent between\nA and B. Therefore,they lie on the same curve, OK?So that's sort of our preference\nmap, our indifference curves.And these indifference\ncurves aregoing to have four\nproperties, four propertiesthat you have to--that follow\nnaturally from this--it's really three and 1/2.The third and fourth are\nreally pretty much the same,but I like to write\nthem out as four.Four properties that follow from\nthese underlying assumptions--Property one is, consumers\nprefer higher indifferencecurves.Consumers prefer higher\nindifference curves, OK?And that's just all\nfrom more is better.That is, an indifference\ncurve that's highergoes through package that has\nat least as much of one thing", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "and more of the other thing.Therefore, you prefer it, OK?So as indifference curve shifts\nout, people are happier, OK?So on that higher\nindifference curve, point C,you are happier\nthan points A and B,because more is better, OK?The second is that indifference\ncurves never cross.Indifference curves\nnever cross, OK?Actually, that's\nthird, actually.I want to come to that in order.Second-- third is the\nindifference curves never--Second is indifference\ncurves are downward sloping.Second is indifference\ncurves are downward sloping.Indifference curves\nare downward sloping.Let's talk about that first, OK?That simply comes from the\nprinciple of nonsatiation.So look at figure 2-2.Here's an upward sloping\nindifference curve, OK?Why does that violate the\nprinciple of nonsatiation?Why does that violate that?Yeah.AUDIENCE: Either, if you're--\neither you're less happy withyou have more cookies, or you're\nless happy if you have morepizza.And like there's-- and\nthat violates nonsatiation.JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.So basically, you're\nindifferent-- on this curve,you're indifferent with one\nof each and two of each.You can't be indifferent.Two of each has got to be\nbetter than one of each.So an upward sloping\nindifference curvewould violate nonsatiation.So that's the second property\nof indifference curve.The third property\nof indifference curveis the indifference\ncurves never cross, OK?We could see that\nin figure 2-3, OK?Someone else tell\nme why this violatesthe properties I wrote up there,\nindifference curves crossing.Yeah.AUDIENCE: Because B and\nC [is strictly better.JONATHAN GRUBER: What's that?AUDIENCE: Because B and\nC, B is strictly better.JONATHAN GRUBER: Because the\nB and C, B is strictly better.That's right.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]JONATHAN GRUBER:\nBut they're also", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "both on the same\ncurve as A. So you'resaying they're both-- you're\nindifferent with A for both Band C, but you can't be, because\nB is strictly better than C.So it violates transitivity, OK?So the problem with\ncrossing indifference curvesis they violate transitivity.And then finally,\nthe fourth is sortof a cute extra\nassumption, but Ithink it's important\nto clarify, whichis that there is\nonly one indifferencecurve through every\npossible consumption bundle,only one IC through\nevery bundle.OK, you can't have two\nindifference curves goingthrough the same bundle, OK?And that's because\nof completeness.If you have two\nindifference curvesgoing through the\nsame bundle, youwouldn't know how you felt, OK?So there can only be one\ngoing through every bundle,because you know how you feel.You may feel indifferent,\nbut you know how you feel.You can't say I don't know, OK?So that's sort of\na extra assumptionthat sort of completes the\nlink to the properties, OK?So that's basically how\nindifference curves work.Now, I find-- when I took\nthis course, before you were--god, maybe before your\nparents were born,I don't know, certainly\nbefore you guys were born--when I took this course,\nI found this coursefull of a lot of light\nbulb moments, thatis, stuff was just\nsort of confusing,and then boom, an example\nreally made it work for me.And the example that made\nindifference curves work to mewas actually doing\nmy first UROP.When my UROP was with a grad\nstudent, and that grad studenthad to decide whether he\nwas going to accept a job.He had a series of job\noffers, so he had to decide.And basically, he said, \"Here's\nthe way I'm thinking about it.I am indifferent-- I\nhave an indifference mapand I care about two things.I care about school\nlocation and Icare about economics\ndepartment quality.I care about the quality\nof my colleagues,and the research it's done\nthere, and the location.\"And basically, he\nhad two offers.One was from Princeton,\nwhich he put up here.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "No offense to New\nJerseyans, but Princetonas a young single person sucks.OK, fine when you're married\nand have kids, but deadlyas a young single person.And the other-- so\nthat's Princeton.Down here was Santa Cruz.OK, awesome.[INAUDIBLE] is the most\nbeautiful universityin America, OK?But not as good an\neconomics department.And he decided he was roughly\nindifferent between the two.But he had a third offer\nfrom the IMF, whichis a research\ninstitution in DC, whichhas-- he had a lot\nof good colleagues,and DC is way better than\nPrinceton, New Jersey,even though it's not\nas good as Santa Cruz.So he decided he would take\nthe offer at the IMF, OK?Even though the IMF had worse\ncolleagues than Princetonand worse location\nthan Santa Cruz,it was still better in\ncombination of the two of them,given his preferences.And that's how he used\nindifference curvesto make his decision, OK?So that's sort of an\nexample of applying it.Once again, no\noffense to the NewJerseyans in the room, of\nwhich I am one, but believe me,you'd rather be in Santa Cruz.OK, so now, let's\ngo from preferencesto utility functions.OK, so now, we're going to move\nfrom preferences, which we'verepresented graphically, to\nutility functions, which we'regoing to represent\nmathematically.Remember, I want you understand,\neverything this courseat three levels,\ngraphically, mathematically,and most importantly of\nall, intuitively, OK?So graphic is\nindifference curves.Now we come to the\nmathematical representation,which is utility function, OK?And the idea is that every\nindividual, all of youin this room, have a\nstable, well behaved,underlying mathematical\nrepresentationof your preferences, which\nwe call utility function.Now, once again, that's\ngoing to be very complicated,your preference over\nlots of different things.We're going to make things\nsimple by writing outa two dimensional representation\nfor now of your indifferencecurve.We're going to say, how\ndo we act mathematicallyrepresent your feelings\nabout pizza versus cookies?", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "OK?Imagine that's all you\ncare about in the world,is pizza and cookies.How do we mathematically\nrepresent that?So for example, we\ncould write downthat your utility function\nis equal to the square rootof the number of slices of pizza\ntimes the number of cookies.We could write that down.I'm not saying that's right.I'm not saying it works\nfor anyone in this roomor even everyone this room,\nbut that is a possible wayto represent utility, OK?What this would say--this is convenient.We will use-- we'll end up\nusing square root form a lotfor utility functions and a\nlot of convenient mathematicalproperties.And it happens to jive\nwith our example, right?Because in this example, you're\nindifferent between two pizzaand one cookie or one\npizza and two cookie.They're both square root of 2.And you prefer two\npizza and two cookies.That's two, OK?So this gives you a high utility\nfor two pizza and two cookies,OK, than one pizza\nand two cookie,or two pizza and one cookie.So now, the question\nis, what does this mean?What is utility?Well, utility doesn't\nactually mean anything.There's not really a thing\nout there called utiles OK?In other words, utility\nis not a cardinal concept.It is only an ordinal concept.You cannot say your\nutility, you are--you cannot literally say,\n\"My utility is x% higher thanyour utility,\" but\nyou can rank them.So we're going to assume\nthat utility can be rankedto allow you to rank choices.Even if generally, we\nmight slip some and sortof pretend utility is cardinal\nfor some cute examples,but by and large,\nwe're going to thinkof utility as purely ordinal.It's just a way to\nrank your choices.It's just when you\nhave a set of choicesout there over many dimensions--\nlike if your choice in lifewas always over one dimension\nand more was better,it would always be\neasy to rank it, right?You'd never have a problem.Once your choice is over\nmore than one dimension,now if you want\nto rank them, youneed some way to combine them.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "That's what this function does.It allows you essentially to\nweight the different elementsof your consumption\nbundle, so youcan rank them when it\ncomes time to choose, OK?Now, this is obviously\nincredibly simple,but it turns out to be\namazingly powerful in explainingreal world behavior, OK?And so what I want\nto do today iswork with the underlying\nmathematics of utility,and then we'll come back.We'll see in the\nnext few lectureshow it could actually be\nused to explain decisions.So a key concept we're going\nto talk about in this classis marginal utility.Marginal utility is\njust a derivativeof the utility function with\nrespect to one of the elements.So the marginal utility\nfor cookies, of cookies,is the utility of\nthe next cookie,given how many\ncookies you've had.This class is going\nto be very focusedon marginal decision making.In economics, it's all about how\nyou think about the next unit.Turns out, that makes\nlife a ton easier.Turns out, it's way\neasier to say, \"Do youwant the next cookie,\" than to\nsay, \"How many cookies do youwant?\"Because if you want\nthe next cookie,that's sort of a very\nisolated decision.You say, OK, I had\nthis many cookies.Do I want the next cookie?Whereas before you start\neating, if you say,how many cookies\ndo you want, that'ssort of a harder,\nmore global decision.So we're going to focus on\nthis stepwise decision makingprocess of do you want the\nnext unit, the next cookie,or the next slice of pizza, OK?And the key feature\nof utility functionswe'll work with\nthroughout the semesteris that they will feature\ndiminishing marginal utility.Marginal utility will fall\nas you have more of a good.The more of a good\nyou've had, the lesshappiness you'll derive\nfrom the next unit, OK?Now, we can see that\ngraphically in figure 2-4.Figure 2-4 graphs on\nthe x-axis the numberof cookies holding\nconstant pizza.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "So let's say you're\nhaving two pizza slices,and you want to say, what's my\nbenefit from the next cookie?And on the left axis,\nviolating what I justsaid like 15 seconds\nago, we graph utility.Now, once again, the utile\nnumbers don't mean anything.It's just to give\nyou an ordinal sense.What you see here is that\nif you have 1 cookie,your utility is 1.4,\nsquare root of 2 times 1.If you have 2\ncookies, your utilitygoes up to square\nroot of 4, which is 2.You are happier with\n2 cookies, but youare less happy from the second\ncookie than the first cookie,OK?And you could see\nthat in figure--if you flip back and\nforth between 2-4 and 2-5,you can see that, OK?The first cookie, going\nfrom 0 to 1 cookie,gave you one-- so in\nthis case, we're nowgraphing the marginal utility.So figure 2-4 is the\nlevel of utility,which is not really something\nyou can measure, in fact.Figure 2-5 is something\nyou can measure,which is marginal utility,\nwhat's your happiness--and we'll talk about\nmeasuring this--from the next cookie.You see, the first cookie gives\nyou a utility increment of 1.4,OK?You go from utility of\n0 to utility of 1.4.The next cookie gives you\nutility increment of 0.59.OK, you go from utility\nof 1.41 to utility of 2.The next cookie gives\nutility increment of 0.45,the square root of 3.So now we flip back\nto the previous page.We're going from the\nsquare root of 4,we're going from the\nsquare root of 4--I'm sorry-- to the\nsquare root of 6.Square root of 6 is only 0.45\nmore than the square root of 4,and so on.So each additional cookie\nmakes you less and less happy.It makes you happier, it has\nto, because more is better,but it makes you less\nand less happy, OK?And this makes sense.Just think about\nany decision lifestarting with\nnothing of somethingand having the first\none, slice of pizza,", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "a cookie, deciding on\nwhich movie to go to.The first movie, the one\nyou

of\npizza make you happier--Now, you may be\nclose to indifferent.Maybe the second slice of\npizza makes you almost ashappy as the first.But the first will\nmake you happier, OK?If you think about--that's really sort\nof that first step.You were hungry, and that first\none makes you feel happier.Now, but you got to remember,\nyou always want more cookies.Now, you might say,\n\"Wait a second.This is stupid.Once I've had 10 cookies,\nI'm going to barf.The 11th cookie can\nactually make me worse off,because I don't like barfing.\"But in economics,\nwe have to remember,you don't have to\neat the 11th cookie.You can give it away.So if like say, you don't\nwant the 11th cookie,you can save it for later.You can give it to a friend.So you always want it.In the worst case,\nyou throw it out.It can't make you worse off, it\ncan only make you better off.And that's what our sort of\nmore is better assumptioncomes from.Obviously, the limit-- you know,\nif you get a million cookies,your garbage can gets full.You have no friends\nto give them to.I understand at the limit,\nthese things fall apart, OK?But that's the basic\nidea of more is betterand the basic idea of\ndiminishing marginal utility.OK, any questions about that?Yeah.AUDIENCE: Can the utility\nfunction ever be negative?JONATHAN GRUBER:\nUtility functioncan never be negative\nbecause we have-- well,utility-- once again, utility\nis not an ordinal concept.You can set up\nutility functions suchthat the number is negative.You can set that up.OK, the marginal utility\nis always positive.You always get some\nbenefit from the next unit.Utility, once again, the\nmeasurement's relevant.So it could be negative.You could set it up--I could write my utility\nfunction like this,you know, something like that.So it could be negative.That's just a sort\nof scaling factor.But marginal utility\nis always positive.You're always happier,\nor it's non-negative.You're always happier\nor at least indifferentto getting the next unit.Yeah.AUDIENCE: So when\nyou're looking at 2-5,if you get like a\nfraction of a cookie,is the marginal utility\nstill going to go up?", "start": 1320.0,

easier\nto start from one.So corner solutions, we'll\ntalk about corner solutionsin this class, they get ugly.Think of it starting from one.Starting with that first cookie,\nevery fraction of a cookiemakes you happier, but less and\nless happy with each fraction.Good question.All right, good questions.All right, so now,\nlet's talk about--let's flip back from the\nmath to the graphics,and talk about where\nindifference curves come from.I just drew them out.But in fact,\nindifference curves arethe graphical representation\nof what comes outof utility function, OK?And indeed, the slope\nof the indifferencecurve, we're going to call the\nmarginal rate of substitution,the rate essentially\nat which you'rewilling to substitute\none good for the other.The rate at which you're willing\nto substitute cookies for pizzais your marginal\nrate of substitution.And we'll define that as the\nslope of the indifferencecurve, delta p over delta c.That is your marginal\nrate of substitution.Literally, the\nindifference curvetells you the rate at which\nyou're willing to substitute.You just follow\nalong and say, \"Look,I'm willing to give up--\"So in other words, if you look\nat figure 2-6, you say, \"Look,I'm indifferent between\npoint A to point B.One slice of pizza--I'm sorry-- one cookie\nand four slices of pizzais the same to me as two cookies\nand two slices of pizza.\"Why is it the same?Because they both give me\nutility square root of four,right?So given this mathematical--I'm not saying you are.I'm saying, given this\nmathematical representation,OK, you are indifferent\nbetween point A and pointB. So what that\nsays-- and what'sthe slope with the\nindifference curve?What's the arc slope\nbetween point A and point B?", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "The slope is negative 2.So your

cookie.Delta p delta c\nis negative 2, OK?Now, it turns out you can\ndefine the marginal rateof substitution over any\nsegment of indifference curve,and what's interesting\nis it changes.It diminishes.Look what happens when we\nmove from two pizzas and twocookies, from\npoint B to point C.Now the marginal\nrate of substitutionis only negative of 1/2.Now I'm only willing to\ngive up one slice of pizzato get two cookies.What's happening?First, I was willing give\nup two slices of pizzato get one cookie.Now I'm only willing to\ngive up one slice of pizzato get two cookies.What's happening?Yeah.AUDIENCE: You don't\nwant a cookie as much?JONATHAN GRUBER: Because of?AUDIENCE: Diminishing\nmarginal utility.JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.Diminishing margin\nutility has causedthe marginal rate\nof substitutionitself to diminish.For those who are really kind\nof better at math than I am,it turns out technically,\nmathematically,marginal utility isn't\nalways diminishing.You can draw up cases.MRS is always diminishing.So you can think of marginal\nas always diminishing.It's fine for this class.When you get to higher\nlevel math and economics,you'll see marginal utility\ndoesn't have to diminish.MRS has to diminish, OK?MRS is always diminishing.As you go along the\nindifference curve,that slope is\nalways falling, OK?So basically, what\nwe can right nowis how the MRS relates\nto utility function.Our first sort of\nmind-blowing resultis that the MRS is\nequal to the negativeof the marginal\nutility of cookiesover the marginal\nutility of pizza.That's our first key definition.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "It's equal to the negative\nof the marginal utilityof the good on the x-axis\nover the marginal utilityof the good on the y-axis,

not a lot of cookies.When you have lots of pizza,\nyour marginal utility is small.Here's the key insight.This is the thing which, once\nagain, it's a light bulb thing.If you get this, it'll make\nyour life so much easier.Marginal utilities are\nnegative functions of quantity.The more you have\nof a thing, the lessyou want the next unit of it.That's why, for example,\ncookies is now in the numeratorand pizza is in the denominator,\nflipping from this side, OK?The more you have a good,\nthe less you want it.So start at point A.\nYou have lots of pizzaand not a lot of cookies.You don't really\nwant more pizza.You want more cookies.That means the\ndenominator is small.The marginal utility\nof pizza is small.You don't really want it.But the marginal utility\nof cookies is high.You want many of them.So this is a big number.Now let's move to point B.\nThink about your next decision.Well, now, your marginal\nutility of pizza,if you were going to go from\ntwo to one slice of pizza,now pizza is worth a\nlot more than cookies.So now it gets smaller.So essentially, as you move\nalong that indifference curve,because of this, you want--\nbecause of diminishingmarginal utility,\nit leads this issueof a diminishing marginal\nrate substitution, OK?So basically, as you move\nalong the indifference curve,you're more and more willing to\ngive up the good on the x-axisto get the good on the y-axis.As you move from the\nupper left to the lower", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "right on that indifference\nmap, figure 2-6,you're more you're\nmore willing to give upthe good on the x-axis to\nget the good on the y-axis.And what this implies is that\nindifference curves are--indifference curves are\nconvex to the origin.Indifference curves are\nconvex to the origin.That's very important.OK, let's see, they\nare not concave.They're either\nconvex or straight.Let's say they're not concave\nto the origin, to be technical.Indifference curves\ncan be linear.We'll come to that.But they can't be\nconcave to the origin.Why?Well, let's look at the next\nfigure, the last figure,figure 2-7.What would happen if\nindifference curves wereconcave to the origin?Then that would say,\nmoving from one pizza--so now I've drawn a\nconcave indifference curve.And with this indifference\ncurve, moving from point Ato point B leaves\nyou indifferent.So you're happy to give\nup one slice of pizzato get one cookie.Starting with four slices\nof pizza and one cookie,you were happy to give\nup one slice of pizzato get one cookie.Now, starting from\ntwo and three,you're now willing to give\nup two slices of pizzato get one cookie.What does that violate?Why does that not make sense?Yeah.AUDIENCE: Law of diminishing\nmarginal returns?JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, law of\ndiminishing marginal utility.Here, you were happy to\nhave one slice of pizzato get one cookie.Now you are willing to\nhave two slices of pizzato get one cookie,\neven though you haveless pizza and more cookies.That can't be right.As you have less pizza and\nmore cookies, cookies--pizza should become more\nvaluable, not less valuable,and cookies should become less\nvaluable, not more valuable.So a concave to the\norigin indifferencecurve would violate\nthe principleof diminishing marginal utility\nand diminishing marginal rateof substitution, OK?Yeah.AUDIENCE: What if it's like\nsomething like trading cards?JONATHAN GRUBER: OK.AUDIENCE: I mean, I mean, as\nyou get more trading cards,", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "you have-- you're already\nmade a complete set.JONATHAN GRUBER: That's\nvery interesting.So in some sense,\nwhat that is sayingis that your utility\nfunction is really over sets.You're saying your\nutility functionsisn't over trading cards.It's over sets.So basically, that's\nwhat's sort of a bit--you know, our\nmodels are flexible.One way is to say they're loose.Another way is to\nsay they're flexible.But one of the challenges\nyou'll face on this courseis thinking about what is the\ndecision set over which I'mwriting my utility function?You're saying it's\nsets, not trading cards.So that's why it happens.Other questions?Good question.Yeah, at the back.AUDIENCE: What about like\naddictive things, where like,the more you have it,\nthe more you want to buy?JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, that's\na really relishing question.I spent a lot of my\nresearch life, actually--I did a lot of research\nfor a number of yearson thinking about\nhow you properlymodel addictive\ndecisions like smoking.Addictive decisions\nlike smoking,essentially, it really\nis that your utilityfunction itself shifts as\nyou get more addictive.It's not that your\nmarginal utility--the next cigarette\nis still worthless than the first cigarette.It's just that as you\nget more addicted,that first cigarette gets\nworth more and more to you.So when you wake up in the\nmorning feeling crappy,that first cigarette\nstill does more for youthan the second cigarette.It's just, the next day you\nwake up feeling crappier, OK?So we model addiction\nas somethingwhere essentially,\neach day, cigarettesdo less and less for you.You get essentially adjusted\nto new-- you habituateto higher levels.And this is why I do a lot of\nwork-- you know, this is why,unfortunately, we saw\nlast year, the number--the highest number of\ndeaths from accidentaloverdose in US history.72,000 people died from drug\noverdoses last year, more thanever died in traffic accidents\nin our nation's history, OK?Why?Because people get\nhabituated to certain levels,and they get habituated\nto certain levels.So people get\nhooked on Oxycontin.They get habituated\nto a certain level.They maybe switch\nto heroin, and theyhabituate to a certain level.And now there's this\nthing called fentanyl,", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "which is a synthetic opioid\nbrought over from China,which is incredibly powerful.And dealers are mixing the\nfentanyl in with the heroin.And the people shoot\nup, not realizing--at their habituated\nlevel-- not realizingthey have this\ndangerous substance,and they overdose and die.And that's because they've\ngot habituated to high levels.They don't realize they're\ngetting a different product.So it's not about not\ndiminishing marginal utility.It's about different--\nunderlying different products.All right?Other questions?Sorry for that\ndepressing note, but it'simportant to be\nthinking about that.That's why, once again,\nwe're the dismal science.We have to think\nabout these things.OK, now, let's come\nto a great examplethat I hope you've\nwondered about,and maybe you've already\nfigured out in your life,but I hope you've\nat least stoppedand wondered about,\nwhich is the pricesof different sizes of goods,\nin a convenience store, say.OK, take Starbucks.You can get a tall\niced coffee for 2.25,or the next size, whatever the\nhell they call it, bigger, OK?You can get, for 70 more cents--so 2.25, and you can double\nit for 70 more cents.Or take McDonald's.A small drink is $1.22 at the\nlocal McDonald's, but for 50more cents, you can\ndouble the size, OK?What's going on here?Why did they give you\ntwice as much liquid,or if you go for ice\ncream, it's the same thing.Why do they give you twice as\nmuch for much less than twiceas much money?What's going on?Yeah.AUDIENCE: Since your marginal\nutility is diminishingas you have more coffee\navailable to you,you're willing to\npay less for it,so they make the\nadditional coffee cheaper.JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.That's a great\nway to explain it.The point is it's all about\ndiminishing marginal utility.OK, when you come in to\nMcDonald's on a hot day,you are desperate for\nthat soda, but you're notas desperate have\ntwice as much soda.You'd like it.You probably want\nto pay more for it,but you don't like it nearly as\nmuch as that first bit of soda.So those prices simply\nreflects the market's reaction", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "to understanding diminishing\nmarginal utility.Now, we haven't even\ntalked about the supplyside of the market yet.I'm not getting to how\nproviders make decisions.That's a much deeper issue.I'm just saying that this is\ndiminishing marginal utilityin action, how it\nworks in the market,and that's why you see this, OK?So basically, what you see is\nthat that first bite of icecream, for example,\nis worth more,and that's why the ice\ncream that's twice as bigdoesn't cost twice as much.Now, so basically,\nwhat this meansis, if you think about our\ndemand and supply model,on a hot day, or any day, the\ndemand for the first 16 ouncesis higher than the demand\nfor the second 16 ounces.But the cost of producing\n16 ounces is the same.So let's think about this.It's always risky when I try\nto draw a graph on the board,but let's bear with me.OK, so let's say we've got a\nsimple supply and demand model.You have this supply\nfunction for soda,and let's assume\nit's roughly flat.OK, let's assume sort of\nthe cost the firm proceedswithin some range.The firm-- basically,\nevery incremental 16 ouncescosts them the same.So that's sort of\ntheir supply curve.And then you have\nsome demand curve, OK?You have some demand curve\nwhich is downward sloping, OK,and they set some price.And this is the\ndemand for 16 ounces.Now, what's the demand for\nthe next 16 ounces, OK?Yeah, this isn't going to work.We have to have an\nupward-sloping supply curve.Sorry about that.We have a slightly upward\nsloping supply curve, OK?Now we have the\ndemand for the next--so here's your price.Here's your $1.22, OK?Now, you say, \"Well, what's my\ndemand when I sell 32 ounces?\"Well, it turns\nout demand doesn'tshift out twice as much.It just shifts out\na little bit more.So you can only charge $1.72\nfor the next 16 ounces.Probably, if you want\nto go to the big--", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.0}, {"text": "if you go to 7-Eleven, where you\ncan get sizes up to, you know,as big as your house, OK--they keep these curves keep\ngetting closer and closerto each other.So those price increments\nget smaller and smaller.And that's why you can\nget the monster, you know,ginormous Gulp at 7-Eleven--is really just not that\ndifferent from the priceof getting the small\nlittle mini size, OK,because of diminishing\nmarginal utility.All right, and so\nthat's how the market--that's essentially how we can\ntake this abstract concept,this sort of crazy\nmath, and turn itinto literally what you see in\nthe store you walk into, OK?Questions about that?Yeah.AUDIENCE: So how does this\n[? place ?] [INAUDIBLE],,like if for example, you wanted\nto buy a snack that you weregoing to have for\nbreakfast every day--JONATHAN GRUBER: Awesome.Awesome question.AUDIENCE: And then\nevery single day,it was going to be your\nfirst granola bar, right?So I think that it's going to\ndiminish every single time,but it's still\ncheaper to buy in bulkthan it would be to buy a single\ngranola bar every single time.JONATHAN GRUBER:\nGreat, great question.Yeah?AUDIENCE: I think that has\nmore to do with packaging costthan marginal utility.JONATHAN GRUBER:\nWell, I mean, the riskof my going to this model\nis, once we get nonlinear,the order we do\nthings in this class,we have to start\ntalking about supplyfactors I want to talk to.But there's two answers.One is packaging efficiencies.But the other is, if you\nactually go to Costcoand look at their\nprices, for many things,they're not actually better\nthan the supermarket.So actually, the price\nof buying the giant like,8,000 bars of granola is\nactually not that much more--not that much less than 1,000\ntime buying eight granola bars.It's less, but it's not nearly\nas much less of these examplesas sodas in McDonald's,\nwhich is exactly your point.Utility diminishes\nless, so they don'twant to charge as much\nless for multiple packages.So you can actually--\nif you

wanted--were thirsty again, or--JONATHAN GRUBER:\nAwesome, and thatis why they don't let you\nwalk back in with the same cupand refill it, right?That's exactly right, and\nthat comes to this point.It's sort of like\nit's nonperishableas you get longer apart.But you know, it's all\njust really interesting.So at Fenway, OK, you can get--you get like a regular\nsized soda, it's like
