[{"text": "NANCY KANWISHER: So seeing\nwhere animals are going,so you can avoid them if\nthey're coming after youor so you can catch them if\nyou're going after them, right?One of the arguably\nuniquely human abilitiesis precision throwing, right?No other animal can do that.That's a very human thing.Although, visual motion is\nshared with lots of abilityto see motion is shared\nwith lots of animals.What else did you notice?What else seemed funny or harder\nto discern with stop motion?Yeah?AUDIENCE: We care about small\ndetails like [INAUDIBLE]to understand what\nthe person is seeing.NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah.Yeah, so I was\nmaking notes to self.I haven't done that demo before.But in future, it would\nbe really good to havethe audio quality terrible.Because if the audio\nquality is terrible,you would lean more\non lip reading.And we might have noticed more.But it's really hard to\ndo that probably evenat relatively fast flicker rates\nbecause that motion informationis important.Absolutely.What else?How about beyond\njust lip reading?What else did you notice about\nthe faces, mine or Jim's?Could you-- yeah?AUDIENCE: They were static.So it was kind of hard\nto tell like emotionbecause a lot of the\nways we express emotionis very nuanced.NANCY KANWISHER: Exactly.Exactly.Facial expressions\nare incredibly subtle.Like little\nmicroexpressions flickeracross the face in a tenth\nof a second and go away,and you guys detect them.Like we're very, very\nsensitive to those things.Sometimes if you see somebody\nin a hallway and, for a moment,there's an expression that\nflickers across their faceand then they give\nyou a normal smile,but you can tell\nfrom that expressionthat actually they\ndidn't want to see you,for whatever reason, right?", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.117}, {"text": "We catch those things.We're really, really\ngood at catchingthose little\nfleeting expressions.And those probably have to\ndo with not just samplingwith fine temporal frequency\nbut probably seeingthe direction of motion of\neach little part of the face.OK?OK, so this is just\ncommon sense reasoningabout what we might\nhave motion for.OK?And so you guys got all the\nthings that I had in mind.OK, so now the next question,\njust kind of thought question,speculation question, given\nthese many different thingsthat make motion important\nto us, biologically,ecologically, in\nour daily lives,maybe that's important\nenough that wemight allocate special brain\nmachinery to processing motion.What do you think?Important enough?Could you get by if you lived\nin a strobe world all the time?Could you survive just fine?Hard to say, right?Might be hard.I mean, we probably don't need\nto go hunting down predators.But you walk across\nVassar Street.And there's some pretty\ndangerous predatorscoming down Vassar Street\nin the way of cars, right?You need to know\nwhere they're goingand whether you can\ncross in front of them.So it's actually pretty\nhard to live lifewithout being able\nto see motion.And I'll tell you about a woman\nwho has that experience laterin the lecture.OK, next question,\njust think about this.I'm not going to test\nyou on it or anything.It's not the topic\nof this course.But it's a perspective\nyou should take.Imagine that this\nwere a CS courseand I gave you a\nsegment of video.And your task was to\nwrite some code thattakes that video input\nand says whether objectsare moving in that movie or\nsays which objects are movingor how much they're moving or\nwhat direction they're moving.What kind of code\nwould you have to writeto take that video input\nto try to figure that out?OK, so just think about that.We're not going to be\nwriting code in this class.But a lot of what\nwe're going to be doingis thinking about,\nhow do you takethis kind of perceptual\ninput and come outwith that kind of\nperceptual inference?", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And what kinds of\ncomputations wouldhave to go on in between whether\nthose computations are going onin code that you guys write\nor in a piece of brain that'sdoing that computation?And thinking about how\nyou might write the codegives you really\nimportant insightsabout what the brain\nmight be doing.OK?All right, so that's the\npoint of all of that.The Marr reading talks\nabout all of this.And the key point we're\ntrying to get hereis that you can't\nunderstand perceptionwithout thinking about what\neach perceptual inference isnecessary for ecologically\nin daily livesand about the computational\nchallenges involvedin making that inference.OK?So we'll get back to all\nthat next week and beyond.But meanwhile, here's\nthe agenda for today.So here's the agenda.We just did the demo.We're now going to skip and do\nsome neuroanatomy, absolutelybare basics.Because on Wednesday, we\nhave this amazing opportunityto have one of the most famous\nneuroscientists in the worlddo a dissection of\na real human brainright here right\nin front of you.It's going to be awesome.And I don't want to\nwaste that opportunityor embarrass ourselves\nby having people notknow the bare basics.So we're going to\ndo the bare basics.It's all stuff you should\nknow from 900 and 901.And I'm going to\nwhip through it fast,so we can get to more\ninteresting stuffand get back to visual motion.OK?That's the agenda.All right, so some\nabsolute bare basicsof the brain, the human brain\ncontains about 100 billion,10 to the 11th neurons.And that's a very big number.That's such a big number it's\napproximately Jeff Bezos'worth.Well, it was until Mackenzie\ngot into the picture.So we'll see.No, you don't need to\nremember this number.Just know it's a\nreally big number.Basics of a neuron,\nhere's a neuron.A neuron is a cell like\nany other cell in the body.It's got a cell body\nand a nucleus, justlike any other\ncell in your body.But the thing that's\ndistinctive about a neuronis it has a big long\nprocess called an axon.It's got a bunch of dendrites,\nthe little processes,the little thingies\nnear the cell body.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And out at the tip of the axon,\nthat's your classic neuron.Many neurons have\na myelin sheath,a layer of rolled up fat\naround the axon made upof other cells.That makes the axon conduct\nneural signals faster.OK, you should know all that.I'm not trying to insult\nyour intelligence.I'm just trying to make sure\neverybody's with the programhere.OK, so you have thousands\nof synapses on each neuron.And that means you have-- to\nput it technically-- a shitloadof synapses in your brain.OK?Another important point, the\nbrain runs on a mere 20 watts.And if you're not impressed\nwith that, reflect on the factthat IBM's Watson\nruns on 20,000 watts.So one of the cool things\nabout the human brainis not just all\nthe awesome stuffthat we can do that\nstill no computer can do,that I talked about\nlast time, but alsohow incredibly\nenergetically efficientlywe do it with our human brains.So most of this course is\ngoing to talk about the cortex.That's all the stuff on\nthe outside of the brain.That's that sheet\nwrapping aroundthe outside of the brain,\nthat folded outer surface.It's approximately the size\nand area of a large pizza.But there are lots of\nother important bits too.And I'm going to just\ndo whirlwind tourof those other bits now.OK, so you can\nthink of the brainas composed of four major\nkinds of components.Deep down in the\nbottom of the brain,you have the brain stem, where\nthe spinal cord comes in here.And the rest of the\nbrain is up there.And the brain stem\nis right down here.And the cerebellum, this\nlittle cauliflower like thingthat sits out right back there.And in the middle\nof the brain, youhave the limbic system\nwith a whole bunchof subcortical regions.And we'll talk about a\nfew of those in a moment.And you have white matter,\nall the cables and connectionsthat go from one part of\nthe brain to another part.This is an actual\ndissected human brain.And all those kind of\nweird fibrous thingsare bundles of axons connecting\nremote parts of the brainto each other.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "You can see them in\ngross dissection.OK?And of course, you\nhave the cortex.OK, so these are just four\nmajor things to think about.And before we spend the\nrest of the course on that,we're going to do just\na teeny little biton the other major bits.OK, and I'm going fast.So just stop me if any\nof this isn't clear.All right, so the reason\nwe're doing this in partis that, with a\ndissection of a brain,some of the main\nthings you see arethose subcortical\nstructures, right?And so even though the course\nis going to focus on the cortex,each little different bit of\nthe cortex to the naked eyelooks like any other\nbit of the cortex.It's the subcortical stuff\nthat looks different, right?So that's why we're doing this.OK, bare basics\non the brain stem,you can think of it\nas a bunch of relaysin here, different centers that\nconnect information coming upfrom the spinal cord and send\nit through into the cerebellum.So it's, in many ways, the most\nprimitive part of the brain.That means it's\nshared with animalsthat branched off\nfrom us very farback in mammalian evolution.But it's also essential to life.OK?So you can get by with\nmost of your cortex gone.Like you may not\nhave a lot of fun.You may not really\nknow what's going on.But you will stay alive.But you can't get by without\nyour brain stem, right?It controls all kinds of basic\ncrucial bodily functions,like breathing, consciousness,\ntemperature regulation,et cetera.So it's not interesting\ncognitively.But it's crucial for life.Cerebellum, this\nbeautiful thing here,it's basically involved\nin motor coordination.But from there on out,\nthere's a huge debateabout its possible\nrole in cognition.And so there's lots of\nbrain-imaging studieswhere people find that\nthe cerebellum is engagedin all kinds of\nthings from aspectsof perception up through aspects\nof language understanding.You can find activations\nin brain-imaging studies.Nonetheless, the best\nguess is that you actuallydon't need a cerebellum\nfor any of this.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "So if anybody's\ninterested, I'm goingto actually try to\nremember to put it upas an optional\nreading on the site.There's a recent\narticle in The Atlanticor The New Yorker about a\nkid who had no cerebellum.And he learned to\nwalk late and slow.Nobody knew what\nhis problem was.But he learned to do\npretty much everything.Like he's pretty much fine.His motor coordination\nisn't great, but he's fine.Yeah?AUDIENCE: How would you\ndefine the consciousnessin this context?NANCY KANWISHER: Oh,\nthat's a good question.And it's a big question.And it's a question that\nnobody knows how to answer,not just me.So Christof Koch,\nwho does more workon the neural basis\nof consciousnessthan just about\nanybody, has beengoing around saying,\nfor about 15 years,we must not get stuck on\na premature definitionof consciousness\nbecause we don'tknow what that thing is that\nwe're trying to understand.So I'll hide behind Christof's\nparry of that questionand say we'll talk about\nit later in the course.But there are many\ndifferent waysof defining it from the\ndifference between being awakeversus asleep, which is\nsome of the functions thatgo on here, the difference\nbetween being knocked outand completely unconscious\nunder general anesthesia,which is different\nfrom being asleep.Those kind of states\nof consciousnessare regulated, in\npart, in here, yeah.OK, so you can get by\nwithout a cerebellum.But it's not recommended.Moving right along, all\nthose subcortical bits, we'rejust going to talk about three\nof the most important ones,the thalamus, this\nbig guy right smackin the middle of the brain,\nvery large structure,the hippocampus,\nand the amygdala.OK, let's talk\nabout the thalamus.Think about the thalamus\nas a Grand CentralStation of the brain, OK,\nwith all of these connectionsgoing to all those\nparts of cortexcoming in and out of\nthe thalamus like that.OK?So one of the key things\nabout the thalamusis that most of the\nincoming sensory informationgoes by way of the thalamus\nen route to the cortex.OK?So if you start with\nyour ear, there's", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.118}, {"text": "sensory endings in\nyour ear that we'lltalk about later in the term.And they send neurons into\nthis, the thalamus here,this yellow thing, through\na bunch of different stages.They make a stop\nin the thalamus.And then they come up\nhere to this green patch,which is auditory cortex.OK?Similarly,\nsomatosensory endings,touch sensors in\nyour skin that enableyou to feel when\nyou're being touchedcome in through the skin.And they make a stop\nin the thalamus.And then they go up to\nsomatosensory cortex up there.OK?Similarly, visual signals\nthat come in from your eyesmake a stop in the thalamus and\nthen go up to visual cortex.OK, what's the name of the\nstructure in the thalamusthat those axons\nmake a synapse in?Coming up from the eyes,\nyou make a synapse here.And you go up to visual cortex.AUDIENCE: LGN.NANCY KANWISHER: LGN, perfect.What does it stand for?AUDIENCE: Lateral\ngeniculate nucleus.NANCY KANWISHER: Perfect.OK, you should know that.This is review from 900, 901.OK, yes?Sorry.OK, which sensory modality does\nnot go through the thalamusen route to cortex\nbetween the sensory nerveendings and the cortex?Sorry?AUDIENCE: Olfactory.NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.Yes.You guys are on the ball.Yes, olfactory system is\nthe one sensory modalitythat doesn't make a\nstop in the cortex.You can sort of see that here.From the nose, it goes straight\nup into olfactory cortexright there.All right, so that's\nthe standard viewof the thalamus is this\nkind of like relay stationwhere all the external sensory\ninformation comes in there,makes a stop, and then\ngoes up to cortex.OK?That's my thalamus act.Boom.Like that, right?OK.But, increasingly,\nthere's evidencethat the thalamus is much\nmore than a relay station.And why would you bother\nwith a relay anyway?Kind of doesn't mean anything.Kind of means like\nwe don't know what'sgoing on here because\nyou wouldn't just make", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "a synapse for no reason, right?OK, and so the\nfirst thing to note,is there are lots\nof connections thatgo back down the other way?There are 10 times\nas many connectionsthat go from primary\nvisual cortexright here in me, right\nhere in this guy in red,there are 10 times as many\nthat go backwards downto the thalamus as go forwards.That's mind blowing, right?Information comes from the\neyes up into the brain.What the hell are those things\ndoing going backwards, OK?Well, they're doing all\nkinds of interesting things.So that's the first indication\nthat the thalamus isn't justrelaying stuff in a\nstupid, passive way.And the second\nwhole line of work,which many people\nare working on,but I think some of the most\nawesome work on this topicis done by our own Mike\nHalassa in this department.And he does these\nincredible studiesthat you can do in mice with\nthese spectacular methodsthat we can't use in humans,\nwhere he can really take apartthe circuit and\nmagnificent detail.And he's showing\nthat the thalamusis involved in all kinds\nof high-level cognitivecomputations in mice.It's really stunning work.When the mice have to switch\nfrom doing one task to another,the thalamus plays a key role in\ngating the flow of informationfrom one cortical\nregion to another, OK?All right, moving along,\nthe hippocampus, I youguys all learned about this.The number one gripe\nin this departmentas we learn about\nH.M. in every course.So that's going to happen here.But it's going to\nlast about 20 seconds.So here goes.That's a normal slice\nof the brain like this.Here's the hippocampus\non either side.It's like a whole curled up deal\nright there and right there.And here is H.M.'s brain,\nthe famous H.M., whohad surgery to remove his\nhippocampus on both sides,and completely lost his episodic\nmemory for anything thathappened after his surgery.OK?You all remember that, right?If anybody hasn't heard\nof H.M., send me an email.And I'll give you some\nbackground reading.OK, so very loosely,\nthe hippocampus", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "involved both in this kind\nof long-term episodic memorythat H.M. lost.And it also plays a\nkey role in navigation,which we'll talk about in\ngreat detail in a few weeks.And I just want to say\nthat some cases areeven more extreme than H.M.So there's a case of\nLonni Sue Johnson.And I am trying to\nget you guys a video.And I didn't get it in time.But I'll show it to you later in\nthe term if you're interested.Lonni Sue Johnson\nhad a viral infectionthat went up into her brain.She was an extremely\naccomplished person.She did illustrations on\nthe cover of The New Yorker.She was a pilot.She had her own\nfarm in which sheraised lots of stuff, a\nvery smart, interesting,multitalented woman, who\nhad this terrible tragedyof getting viral\nencephalitis at Idon't know what\nage, but middle age.And she now does not remember\na single event in her life.She's smart.She's funny.Her personality\nis totally intact.She can answer questions.She can paint.She can do all kinds of things.But she does not remember\na single event in her life.That's pretty astonishing.Reflect on what it means\nto have the sense of selfif you don't remember\nanything in your life.Yeah?AUDIENCE: Can she\nremember her name?NANCY KANWISHER:\nThat's a good question.I'm not sure she.Might know her-- yes,\nshe does know her name.Actually, it is\nevident in this video.But the video, well, so\nshe doesn't remember.At one point in this\nvideo, she's asked,were you ever married?And she's lovely and sweet and\ngentle and kind of low key.And she's like, you know,\njust don't remember.I might have been.I might have been.She was married for 10 years.So that's the hippocampus.Important.You don't want to lose that one.Yeah?AUDIENCE: About H.M.,\nif the hippocampusis used in long-term memory,\nwhy is it that it being removedcaused him to not form memories?NANCY KANWISHER: Well, so\nlong-term memory means--it's a vague term.It means the formation\nand retrieval", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "of memories that are\ngoing to last a long time.So in H.M.'s case, he can\naccess a lot of the memoriesfrom before his injury.In Lonni Sue's case,\nshe can't do even that.OK?All right, the\namygdala, OK, amygdalais a Greek word\nthat means almond.Because the amygdala is the\nsize and shape of an almond.And so just for fun, we're\npassing around some almonds,my favorite kind.Have some almonds\nand pass them around.All right, OK, so\nthe amygdala isinvolved in experiencing\nand recognizing emotions,especially fear.The simple statement that you\nshould remember about whatthe amygdala does is just\nremember the four F's.You guys all know about the\nfour F's, fighting, fleeing,feeding, and mating.OK, patient SM lost her\namygdala on both sides.OK?She cannot experience fear.She doesn't recognize\nfear on facial expressionsof other people.And she doesn't\nexperience fear herself.OK?And so that's the\nstriking piece of evidenceon what the amygdala does.Her face recognition is\nnormal, recognizing identities.Her IQ is normal.She's overly trusting\nof other people.OK?OK, so that's all\nyou need to knowabout the amygdala for now.OK, let's talk about white\nmatter, just brief review.Here's a kind of tunnel\nthrough a piece of cortex.OK, so my brain cortex is\nwrapping around like that.If we took a piece like\nthis, just took a segment outlike that, this is the\noutside of the brain up there.Cortex runs like this.And gray matter is the\nstuff on the outer surfacethat's full of cell bodies, OK?White matter are the\naxons, the processesthat come out of\nthose cell bodiesand travel elsewhere\nin the brain.OK?Everybody clear on that?", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "OK, so we got gray matter up\nhere and white matter downthere, mostly myelinated axons\nthat have that layer of fatto make them conduct fast.And so you'll see bundles of\nwhite matter in the dissection.And so here's an\nactual photographof the slice through a brain.So all that white stuff\nup there is white matter.OK, and so you might\nsay, well, that'sjust a big bunch of wires.Who cares about that?That's a good question.But actually, the wires\nare pretty damn interestingand pretty fundamental.And so I'll just give\nyou a few reasons.And you don't need to\nmemorize every one of these.I'm trying to give you a gist\nof why we might care about this.And then there will be a whole\nother lecture on networksand connectivity\nlater in the course.Well, first of all, white matter\nis 45% of the human brain, OK?So it takes up a lot of space,\nall those wires connectingone bit to another bit.And I would say we cannot\npossibly understand the cortexand how it works or any little\npiece of it without knowingthe connectivity of each\npiece to each other bitof the cortex, right?Imagine trying to understand\na computer or a circuitwithout being able to see the\nconnections between the bits.Like it would drive you crazy.That's the situation we're\nin now in human cognitiveneuroscience.It, frankly, drives me insane.But that's where we are.Next thing, the\nlong-range connectivityof each little bit of cortex,\nsome little bit right therein my brain, is\nconnected to some bunchof other remote\nregions in my brain.And that particular\nset of connectionsis distinctive for\nthat patch of cortex.So you can think of it as\na connectivity fingerprintof a patch of cortex.OK, so one of the ways that\nthe different bits differfrom each other is by\nway of their connectivityfingerprints.And I'm going to skip\nthe rest of thesebecause we're going to\nget back to them later.And I'm going to\nrun out of time.And I'm going to assign the\nTAs to sound the gong at 12:15.OK?Good.All right, now we're\nup to the cortex.This is really,\nlaughably, shallow.But whatever, that's\nwhat we're doing here.", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.121}, {"text": "So here's this cortex.And as I mentioned,\nit's a whole big sheet.And the different bits look\nreally similar if you justlook at them or slice them up.So how are we\ngoing to figure outhow this thing is organized?Well, OK, now we're up\nhere talking about cortex.All right, let's start\nwith the easy parts,which you've already seen.You've already\nseen this up here.These colored bits, visual\ncortex, auditory cortex,somatosensory cortex, gustatory\ntaste cortex, those bitsare like the easy\nparts of cortex.Those are called\nprimary sensory regions.There's also motor cortex right\nin front of sensory cortex.So those are the\nprimary regions.They're primary in\nthe sense of thisis the first place that\nsensory information lands upat the cortex coming up\nfrom the senses, right?OK, and all of that input is\nwired through what structure?AUDIENCE: Thalamus.NANCY KANWISHER: Yes.Thank you.So how are these\nregions organized?Well, they have maps.Every one of these\nregions has a map.And each of them has a\nmap of a different thing.So let's start\nwith visual cortex,and we're going to\ntalk about the map thatlives in visual cortex.But the prior condition\nfor understanding that mapis to understand the concept\nof receptive field, whichyou should know.So I'm going to whip\nthrough it quickly.OK, so here is how\nyou map the receptivefield as a property of an\nindividual cell in a brain.OK?So the classic way in\nanimal neuroscienceis you place an\nelectrode in the brainnext to a neuron in\nmonkey visual cortex.OK?So here's this monkey.He's got an electrode\nright in his brainright next to a neuron\nin visual cortex.And every time that neuron\nfires, you get a spike.You hear a spike.OK, now you train the monkey\nto stare at a fixation spotwithout moving its eyes.OK, I can do this with\nhumans without training you.", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.259}, {"text": "I can just tell you, look\nat the tip of my nose.OK, so keep your eyes\non the tip of my nose.I can see if you're\nlooking elsewhere.So look at the tip of my nose.OK?OK, so you train a\nmonkey to do that.That takes a few months.And then they can do that.And then while recording\nfrom neurons in his brain,you put stimuli over here,\nput a flash over thereor a flash over here or a flash\nover here or a flash over here.OK, you can stop\nlooking at my nose.It's not all that fabulous\na nose, I realize.OK, so a receptive field is\nthe place in the visual worldthat makes a given neuron fire.OK?So if there's a\nneuron in your brainthat responds to a flash here\nbut not a flash here or hereor here or here, the\nreceptive field of that neuronis right there.Everybody got that idea?OK, so in visual\ncortex, neurons haverestricted receptive fields.They don't respond to anything\nanywhere in the visual field.They respond to a\nparticular place in space.OK, if that's confusing\nat all, ask a question.Because it will come\nup again and again.All right, so that's what\nthe rest of this slidesays, what I just said.Blah, blah, blah.It doesn't matter.That's a receptive field.Different visual neurons have\ndifferent receptive fieldsfor different parts of space.Now here comes the\nimportant idea.In visual cortex,\ntwo neurons thatare next to each\nother in visual cortexhave nearby receptive fields.OK?So that's the\nconcept of retinotopyor the map in visual cortex.So you basically have a\nmap of the visual worldin your visual cortex because\nthere's this systematic layoutjust like you have\nin your retina.In your retina, visual\ninformation comes in.And because of optics,\ndifferent parts of your retinarespond to different\nparts of the image.But that information is\npropagated back through the LGNup to primary visual\ncortex where you stillhave a map of the visual space\nup in primary visual cortex.OK?So that map is called\nretinotopic in visual cortexbecause it's oriented\nlike the retina.", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.343}, {"text": "And so here's a particularly\nkind of gruesome but veryliteral depiction of this\nproperty of retinotopyin a monkey brain.This is an experiment done\nvery long ago by Roger Tootell.And what he did was he used\na method called deoxyglucose.And so what deoxyglucose\nis a molecule that'sa whole lot like glucose.But it's got one little\nchange in the molecule,which means it gets stuck\non the metabolic chain.And so it gets taken up by cells\nthat want to take up glucose.And then it gets stuck in\nthere and can't be broken down.So it builds up in cells that\nare metabolically active.OK?So you can put a\nlittle radioactivetracer on deoxyglucose, inject\nit into a person or an animal.And what happens is it builds\nup with this radioactive tagon all the cells\nthat were active.Make sense?OK, so Tootell did an\nexperiment where he hadthe monkey fixate on a spot.And he presented\nthis stimulus here.So the monkey's\nfixating right there.And this stimulus is\nflashing on and off.He injects the radioactive\ndeoxyglucose into the monkeywhile the monkey's\nlooking at this.And then, I'm sorry to say, he\nkilled the monkey, rolled outvisual cortex into a sheet.And there it is.And you can see the\nbullseye patternthat the monkey was looking\nat across the surfaceof visual cortex.Does everybody get that?OK, so that shows\nyou very literallywhat a retinotopic\nmap is in the brain.It's just like the map of the\nvisual world in the retina.But there it is up in\nthe back of the brain.And humans have this too.OK?And so this can be shown in\nhumans with functional MRI.We'll talk later more about\nthe methods of functional MRI.But here's a very\nhigh-resolution functional MRIexperiment done by some\npeople over MGH Charlestown.By the way, when I\nhave names on slides,it's just because, in science,\nwe don't get paid that much.", "start": 1560.0, "heat": 0.232}, {"text": "And so our credit for our cool\ndata is kind of all we have.And so I can't stand to\ntalk about other people'scool experiments without\ngiving them credit.I do not expect you\nto learn the names.It's just my little\npersonal tic that Ineed to have their name\nthere to give them credit,even though you don't\nknow who they are.OK.OK, so what this guy\nJohn Polimeni didwas show human subjects\nthis stimulus here.They were fixating right there.And the stimulus is\nflickering with the dots kindof dancing around.And then he looked on\nthe back in visual cortexon the surface of the brain,\nand he sees an M there.It's the same stimulus.It's just flipped\nupside down, whichis not deep or interesting.The cortex has to be\noriented one way or another.The brain doesn't care whether\nyou turn it around, right?And your map of visual\nspace is upside downin the back of the head.And you see that M. Does\neverybody get how that alsoshows retinotopic\nproperties in the brainin human visual cortex?OK.All right, so the key\nidea of retinotopyis that adjacent parts\nof the visual fieldare mapped to adjacent\nparts of the cortex.All right, OK, a little bit of\nterminology just because peopleare fast and loose\nwith these things.I've already referred to V1\nand primary visual cortex.It's also sometimes\ncalled striate cortex.It's all the same thing.It's the part of\nthe visual cortexwhere the information first\ncomes up from the LGN rightback here.So in me, it's right there.Most of it is in the space\nbetween the two hemispheres.But a little bit\nsticks out on the side.So in this person, that\nyellowy orange stuff,that's primary\nvisual cortex, whichis the same as V1\nand striate cortex.OK?That's just terminology.All right, just as we have\nmaps for visual space,we have maps for touch space.And so you've probably\nseen this diagram hereof the map of touch space going\nacross somatosensory cortexlike this.So this is a picture\nof a slice like that,showing you which parts of the\nbody are mapped out to whichparts of space.", "start": 1680.0, "heat": 0.279}, {"text": "And you can see that\nparticularly important partsof the body get\nbigger bits of cortex.Yeah?OK, just as we have visual\nmaps and touch maps,we have auditory maps\nin auditory cortex,which is right on the top of\nthe temporal lobe right in here.And what's mapped out\nin auditory cortexis auditory frequency,\nhigh versus lowversus high\nfrequencies of sound.And so you see that here's a\npiece of auditory cortex in onesubject, showing\nyou regions thatrespond to high frequencies, low\nfrequencies, high frequencies.Here it is another\nsubject, high, low, high,another subject,\nhigh, low, high.OK, so the point of all of this\nis that primary somatosensorycortex has maps.Everybody clear on this?The different sensory modalities\nmap different dimensions.OK, so what about\nthe rest of cortex?Like you can see,\nmost of the cortexis not primary sensory cortex.Is the rest of cortex just mush?Or are there separate bits\nlike primary sensory areas?And if so, do those\nother bits have maps?And if so, what\nare those maps of?OK?We just took you\nfrom 100 years agoto the cutting edge of the field\nis asking this question in lotsof different ways right now.OK?OK, let's back up and ask,\nwhat counts as a cortical areaanyway?I just posited that these\nprimary sensory regionscount as distinct things.They're like the things, right?They're separate\nthings in the brain.OK?And if for no other reason,\nthen they get direct inputfrom the thalamus, right?OK, but let's back up\nand ask, what exactlyis a cortical area?And we're going to\nconsider this questionby considering the three\nkey criteria for whatcounts as a cortical area.OK, the first one is that\nthat region of cortex", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.281}, {"text": "is distinct from its\nneighbors in function.Neurons there fire in\nresponse to somethingdifferent from the neurons\nin the neighboring region.OK, that's very vague right now.But we'll illustrate that.The next one is--I mentioned this before--\neach distinct region of cortexhas a different\nset of connectionsto other parts of the brain.It has a distinct\nconnectivity fingerprint.OK?And the third thing is,\nfor at least some regionsof the cortex, they're\nphysically different.If you slice them up and stain\nthem and look at them reallycarefully, they\nmight look a littledifferent than other\nbits of the cortex.OK?So those are three of\nthe key criteria thathave been used to say, this bit\nof cortex, it's a thing, right?It's distinct, right?OK, so let's look at\nthe classic examplebeyond those primary regions.Those are the most\nclassic regions.Those are the primary regions\nwe've already talked about.Those are the ones nobody\nwould fight you on that.This one is next in line.Nobody would fight\nyou if you say,visual area MT, that's an area.Well, they might.But most people wouldn't.OK, and then from there on out,\nit's all fighting all the time.OK, so let's talk\nabout visual area MT.It's a little patch of the\ncortex in a monkey brain.This is a side view\nof a monkey brain.And in this human brain, it's\nthat little patch right there.OK, so this region\nmeets all the criteriato be a distinct visual area.So how do we know this?Well, we know this from lots\nand lots of different methods.So I'm going to whip through\na few of those to give youa gist of how we\ncan find evidencethat that region is\ndistinct in functionalconnectivity and the physical\nstuff, sometimes calledcytoarchitecture.OK?All right, function,\nhow would weknow that region has\na different function?Well, one way,\nthe classic way isto

[INAUDIBLE]NANCY KANWISHER: Exactly.That's the receptive field.That's the part of visual space\nthat makes this neuron fire.OK, this neuron also has a\nproperty called direction.It's sensitive to\nmotion, as you see.But it's also specific to\nspecific directions of motion.Everybody see that?OK, so that's a\ndirection-selective neuronin monkey area MT.And here's a way of showing,\nwith data,

everybody see how this\nplot shows you the directionselectivity of that cell?Make sense?Right.OK, so that shows you what\nyou just saw in the movie.So this is one way to establish\nthe function of visual areaMT is stick electrodes in\nthere and record directlyfrom them when a monkey looks\nat different kinds of stimuli.And you see direction\nselectivity when you do that.OK, further, if you actually\ndo this systematically,moving across next door\nbits of monkey area MT,what you find is that,\nas we said before,nearby bits of cortex respond\nto similar things, in this case,to similar directions of motion.So here's a little diagram.As you move across the cortex,\nyou see a systematic changein the direction\nselectivity of neuronsas you move across the cortex.So in MT, we have a map\nof direction preference,just as we had a map\nof spatial locationin primary visual cortex.Make sense?OK, now because those neurons\nare clustered like that--I forget what my next point

we want to more\ngenerally if there isan MT in humans, what do we do?We pop subjects\nin an MRI scanner.And we show them moving\ndots or stationary dots.And we scan them\nwith functional MRI.We'll go through the\ndetails of how thisworks more in future lectures.But what you see,\nbasically, is thisis a slice through\nthe brain like this.And you see this region\nright here responds moreto the moving dots.This is the response.This is time here.This is when the moving\ndots are on high response.And then when it switches\nto stationary dots,the response drops.OK, so with functional\nMRI, you can alsofind the visual area empty\nby the higher responseto moving than stationary dots.Does that make\nsense, more or less?I mean, I'm not giving\nyou any of the details.But for now, they\ndon't

won't\ntell you whether it'sMT you're looking at.But we can ask the question\nof whether your brains haveneurons that are tuned\nfor particular directions.So for this demo, I want you\nto fixate right

happened?AUDIENCE: It wasn't\nmoving exactly [INAUDIBLE]NANCY KANWISHER: Uh huh.Well, it actually should--well, now it's doing\nsomething else.But it should shrink at the end.Did you guys see it shrink?OK, so that's an after effect.And the simple\nversion of the storyis that you are tiring\nout your neurons thatare sensitive to outward\nmotion while you stareat all that outward motion.And after you kind of burn\nthem out and exhaust them,then when you look at\nsomething stationary,it looks like it's going inward.OK?And the general idea is\nyou have pools of neuron--the easiest way to\naccount for that is youhave pools of neurons tuned\nfor different directions.And that's why, if you\ntire out one batch,you have a net signal\nin the other direction.Does that make sense?This is

whether there's direction\nselectivity, not just responsesto motion, in human MT.Yeah?AUDIENCE: I'm just a\nlittle bit confused.So even when an image\nis completely still,like even if you're\nnot detecting motion,those neurons are still firing?NANCY KANWISHER:\nThat's a good question.But most likely,\nthe simple cases--this may have not worked\nbeautifully, in part,because I screwed it up

experiencing motion.So there's no motion\nin the stimulus.But there's motion\nin your percept.OK?So that's the question.All right?So read the paper and find out.Yeah?All right, so all of that tells\nus just that there are neuronssomeplace in your brain that\nare sensitive to the directionof motion.It doesn't tell us that\nthey're in MT in particular.But the assigned reading\nwill talk about that.OK?Right, a further\nbit of evidence isremember I said how, in\nmonkeys, next door bits in MThave similar\ndirection selectivity.That means you can also\ninject an electrical signalin a little patch of MT and\ngive the monkey a net perceptof a direction of motion.OK?If all the neurons were\nscrambled around spatially,so that there was no clustering\nof neurons sensitive to, say,this direction of\nmotion, then stimulationwouldn't do anything.But if you train a\nmonkey to tell youwhat direction of\nmotion he's seeingand you show him just random\ndots that aren't movingin any direction and you\nstimulate one little patch,it'll tell you the\ndirection of motionof the neurons in\nthat little patch.And that is much more\npowerful evidencethat that region is not\nonly responsive to motionbut causally involved in\nyour perception of motion.OK?I'm a little obsessed with this\ndistinction between recordingresponses and\nestablishing causality.So we'll go over this\nin more detail later.But I want you to start\ngetting used to that idea.Another way to test the causal\nrole of area MT in motionis with patients with\nbrain damage in area MT.", "start": 2640.0, "heat":
