[{"text": "Let's talk about StrategyI want everybody in this room to think about your companyand as we're talking,this is not a theory,this is about how to think about your own business and how you're developing how you're thinking about it the choices you're making.What choices you're makingand so let's use this as a working session and then over the course of the daywe're going to hear from a number of other companies that are doing really interesting workand hopefully we'llcumulatively as a result of all of this. I think we'll allenrich our understanding of this very very fundamental topicStrategyNowWhat do we what have we kind of learnedabout how to think about strategy.Well, I think what we learned is thatthe instinct that mostleaders have about success andand most people actually have about success is dangerous is ispotentially distractingWhat I find is that when when you ask a company what success looks likeThe answer that you get, I get a lot is well, I want to be the best company in my industryI want to be the best Bank, I want to be the best Auto company. I want to be the bestConsumer packaged goods company in this category.I want to be the best that's success if I can be the best company in my industryI will succeed and that is a very natural human way to think.We all hope to be the best at what we do,but in business competition and what we've come to understand is that's actually not the way to think about success.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.235}, {"text": "The reason is that there is no best company.So it's pretty dangerous to try to do something that's impossible. There is no best Auto company,there is no bestInsurance company, it all depends.It all depends there is no best, there's no one way to competeThe biggest mistake in strategy is to think that there's only one way to compete,in every industry there are different ways to competedepending on ...What customer and customer needs you're actually trying to meet?So when you ask them the question what's the best car or the best car companyYou can't answer that because being the best all depends onWho you're trying to serve?If you're trying to serve young families being the best is different and if you're trying to serve people like me.Serving people that want, you knowluxury and performance, to be the best at that is very different than providing a very very low cost efficient, you know electric vehicleThere is no best way to compete.There are lots of good ways to compete depending on who you're trying to serve.So the number one principle strategy is don't think this wayInstead what you want to think about is how can I in my company be unique?How can I create unique value for the set of customers I choose to serveStrategy is fundamentally about choice", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.108}, {"text": "It's making a set of choices and the most fundamental choice is Who am I trying to serve andOne of the worst mistakes in strategy is to try to serve everybodyYou can't meet the need of every customer you just can't do it it's impossibleI've seen hundreds of companies try it's impossible. You can't meet all the needs of every customerFundamentally, if you have a strategy you've got to decide which needs of which customersYou're actually going to seek to me that you might be able to doif you're clear aboutwhere you're headingAnother tremendous mistake in strategy is to get into a competition with your competitors on the same thingIf your competitor is trying to be in the lowest cost it's prettyUnusual to win if you then try to chase them and be low-costThe essence of strategy is to find a unique position in your business thatdelivers unique value to the customers you choose to serve.Sounds simplebut most companies don't do it.Most companies are confused they lack clarity on what strategy isandthey and in many companies the there is a fundamental inability to make choices.Which ultimately lead to lack of success.Now again in a country like India where growth has been relatively rapid you can ride you can ride the rising tide anddo okayBut I'm talking today about the companies are gonna be truly successful truly successful not the ones that are just bumping along with the market", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.141}, {"text": "To be truly successful, we really need a strategy and that strategy isn't about just being the bestNow, you know the word strategy gets used a lot and and I always try to helpcompanies I work with and people I work with kind of have a clear understanding what we mean by a strategy.

That's what it's all about.It defines how we're going to compete differentlyandIt also really articulates the competitive advantages that we will seek tocreate and use in order to winOkay, so at a very high-level, this is how I would define strategyAgain note the word long-termStrategies about long term it's not about tomorrow and the next dayIt's about the long term because strategy takes a long time to put in place and implementStrategies about distinguishing yourself being differentIf you're doing the same thing as your competitor, you don't have a strategyYou're just trying to do the same thing betterThat's what we call operational excellence.

There's another level of strategy which is what we call corporate strategy andThat has to do with the overall strategy of the diversified or multi business companyWe got a lot of conglomerates. I don't like the word conglomerateConglomerate is not a strategyWe've got a lot of companies though that are more than one businessWe got to have a strategy for each one of the businessesBecause that's in a different market competing in a different way to serve different customersbut we also need to think about the overall strategy of the diversified group andthat is a very different animal andThere's a new there's this new set of principles or a different set of principle for thinking about thatAgain IFind a lot of confusion a lot of companies mix these up togetherCorporate and business get mixed up.

Okay, soThis is a classic example of industry analysis. It's something that is timelessAlways every single time you think about strategy you have to have a systematic rigorousUnderstanding of your industry and what are the competitive drivers?And how are they changing are they getting worse than getting better where where's the new competitive force coming fromThat you're gonna have to deal with if you're gonna if you're gonna win in that particular industry", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.497}, {"text": "You know, here's another example ofan industryindustrial gasesThe this industry makes oxygen hydrogenargon, all these industrial gases that are increasingly used in production processes in all kinds of other industries andWhat your first look at this industry says, oh my god do I really this is a pretty tough industryBecause I'm selling industrial gases that are commoditiesHydrogen is hydrogenHow can I ever make money just selling a commodity gas?Particularly when I'm selling to a lot of customers who often have bargaining power they're big manufacturing companiesIndustrial gases are made with feedstocks like, you know petrochemicals and I have no control over the price of the feedstockSo if the feed stock price goes up, I'm in trouble if I'm selling a commodity gasAgain not so good element of the industryYou know, it's not not that hard to get in I mean lots of people can figure out use thefigure out how to make helium or hydrogenandHave a little facility in the in the in the factoryAnd many of the customers decide.

So again, I won't go through the detailsBut what I'm trying to get across here is that we all have to be really sophisticated at industry analysisin our businessesWe got a look below the surface.
