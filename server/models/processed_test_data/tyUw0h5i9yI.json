[{"text": " Let's talk about Strategy I want everybody in this room to think about your company and as we're talking, this is not a theory, this is about how to think about your own business and how you're developing how you're thinking about it the choices you're making. What choices you're making and so let's use this as a working session and then over the course of the day we're going to hear from a number of other companies that are doing really interesting work and hopefully we'll cumulatively as a result of all of this. I think we'll all enrich our understanding of this very very fundamental topic Strategy Now What do we what have we kind of learned about how to think about strategy. Well, I think what we learned is that the instinct that most leaders have about success and and most people actually have about success is dangerous is is potentially distracting What I find is that when when you ask a company what success looks like The answer that you get, I get a lot is well, I want to be the best company in my industry", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": " I want to be the best Bank, I want to be the best Auto company. I want to be the best Consumer packaged goods company in this category. I want to be the best that's success if I can be the best company in my industry I will succeed and that is a very natural human way to think. We all hope to be the best at what we do, but in business competition and what we've come to understand is that's actually not the way to think about success. The reason is that there is no best company. So it's pretty dangerous to try to do something that's impossible. There is no best Auto company, there is no best Insurance company, it all depends. It all depends there is no best, there's no one way to compete The biggest mistake in strategy is to think that there's only one way to compete, in every industry there are different ways to compete depending on ... What customer and customer needs you're actually trying to meet? So when you ask them the question what's the best car or the best car company You can't answer that because being the best all depends on", "start": 90.0, "heat": 0.108}, {"text": " Who you're trying to serve?

There are lots of good ways to compete depending on who you're trying to serve. So the number one principle strategy is don't think this way Instead what you want to think about is how can I in my company be unique? How can I create unique value for the set of customers I choose to serve Strategy is fundamentally about choice It's making a set of choices and the most fundamental choice is Who am I trying to serve and One of the worst mistakes in strategy is to try to serve everybody You can't meet the need of every customer you just can't do it it's impossible I've seen hundreds of companies try it's impossible. You can't meet all the needs of every customer Fundamentally, if you have a strategy you've got to decide which needs of which customers", "start": 180.0, "heat": 0.141}, {"text": " You're actually going to seek to me that you might be able to do if you're clear about where you're heading Another tremendous mistake in strategy is to get into a competition with your competitors on the same thing If your competitor is trying to be in the lowest cost it's pretty Unusual to win if you then try to chase them and be low-cost The essence of strategy is to find a unique position in your business that delivers unique value to the customers you choose to serve. Sounds simple but most companies don't do it. Most companies are confused they lack clarity on what strategy is and they and in many companies the there is a fundamental inability to make choices. Which ultimately lead to lack of success.

Here it is Strategy is a set of choices we make Long-term choices to distinguish ourselves from competitors. That's what it's all about. It defines how we're going to compete differently and It also really articulates the competitive advantages that we will seek to create and use in order to win Okay, so at a very high-level, this is how I would define strategy Again note the word long-term Strategies about long term it's not about tomorrow and the next day It's about the long term because strategy takes a long time to put in place and implement Strategies about distinguishing yourself being different If you're doing the same thing as your competitor, you don't have a strategy You're just trying to do the same thing better", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.285}, {"text": " That's what we call operational excellence.

We have to separate the goal we're trying to achieve and then the strategy is how we're gonna get there Strategy is not just one thing one step, strategy is not to go international. That's not a strategy You know raising R&D is not a strategy.

And and the stock market is is sort of a long-term works pretty well as a scorecard if you have good economic performance eventually your stock price goes up But in the short term stock price is a lousy way of judging success The markets can be way off", "start": 630.0, "heat": 0.518}, {"text": " That's what we find in the studies on this question So we're this is all about long-term sustained economic performance and we should have the courage to let the stock price take care of itself and Not try to get crazy trying to please the analysts or Deal with whatever criticism we're getting, you know in the stock market Now when we think about strategy again another key principle and then we're gonna dig in a little bit is Strategy occurs at multiple levels in any company in many companies not every company The core level strategy is what we call business strategy That's how to compete in each or in the distinct business in which you operate So here if you're in passenger cars, you'd have a strategy for passenger cars That's business strategy, but there's in many companies. There's another level of strategy which is what we call corporate strategy and That has to do with the overall strategy of the diversified or multi business company We got a lot of conglomerates. I don't like the word conglomerate Conglomerate is not a strategy We've got a lot of companies though that are more than one business We got to have a strategy for each one of the businesses", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.618}, {"text": " Because that's in a different market competing in a different way to serve different customers but we also need to think about the overall strategy of the diversified group and that is a very different animal and There's a new there's this new set of principles or a different set of principle for thinking about that Again I Find a lot of confusion a lot of companies mix these up together Corporate and business get mixed up. That's a mistake We've got to keep these levels separately and we'll talk about these briefly as we have time now let's talk about business unit strategy and not go quite quickly because Again, I'm hopeful that most of you are pretty well grounded in the key ideas here so what we understand is in it can in a business a particular business The drivers of success and the key elements of strategy have to do with the industry itself the business itself and the position we choose to occupy in that business Strategy is both together. Ok What we what we understand is that industries are different in terms of the nature of competition And we got to understand our industry. We got understand how its Competition is evolving Where it's heading?", "start": 810.0, "heat": 0.497}, {"text": " And what kind of competitive dynamics are we gonna have to contend with? We've got to understand that business by business and then of course we have to make those choices about where we're going to compete But one of the things I I find over and over again is Often the health of your industry is just as important as how good a position you have If you're in a industry that's in trouble that's failing You may have a great position but that's not very valuable so so we got to learn to worry about our industry, too We have to help our industry thrive not just focus only on our own position again These are things that we've learned from many many many examples. In terms of industry analysis hopefully everybody finds this familiar You know we after you know 20 or 25 years of work we have overwhelming evidence that really industry competition is driven by these competitive forces That we introduced many years ago now Those competitive forces collectively drive The fundamental attractiveness of the industry, the average profitability in the industry Yeah, yeah, here's a simple example in the heavy truck industry and in our country", "start": 900.0, "heat": 0.799}, {"text": " very difficult industry if you look at this industry you see a lot of Competitive forces that are challenging We have a lot of vicious vicious competition on price Among the truck manufacturers We have some high regulatory standards which are pushing up their cost To meet those standards, but it's very hard to pass those cost on to the customer because the customer is consolidating Into large or larger fleets and leasing companies that have a lot of bargaining power in order to push down the price So the combination of rising regulatory costs and a powerful customer is squeezing the truck manufacturers We see that to make heavy trucks you make some of the parts in-house some companies make more some companies make less but you're so having to source things like engines and Drivetrain components axles and things like that and many of the suppliers of those Components that you're buying have very strong brands and in fact the trucking company Specifies the brand of the parts that they want on the truck", "start": 990.0, "heat": 0.777}, {"text": " Now they want a Cummins engine. For example So you're so you're buying from suppliers who have a lot of clout Because they have their own relationship with the end customer So that squeezes the truck companies the truck manufacturers in the middle This is in in in in North America Primarily but the same basic structure exists in many other parts of the world It actually isn't that hard to enter in the industry And the threat of entry and entry barriers are a key part of industry analysis And you know it's actually harder to get the dealer network than it is to actually get the parts and assemble the truck And then of course trucks are always competing with substitute substitutes Yet all of us hopefully understand what a substitute is a substitute is a different way of meeting the need That's not this is the same as your product but meets the same need that your product does So if you're trucking if you're a truck manufacturer You know, the customer doesn't need a truck if they're going to use the railroad or if they're going to use water transportation, so particularly You know as railroads railroads have been a real tough competitor for trucks Over the years. Okay, so This is a classic example of industry analysis. It's something that is timeless", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.633}, {"text": " Always every single time you think about strategy you have to have a systematic rigorous Understanding of your industry and what are the competitive drivers? And how are they changing are they getting worse than getting better where where's the new competitive force coming from That you're gonna have to deal with if you're gonna if you're gonna win in that particular industry You know, here's another example of an industry industrial gases The this industry makes oxygen hydrogen argon, all these industrial gases that are increasingly used in production processes in all kinds of other industries and What your first look at this industry says, oh my god do I really this is a pretty tough industry Because I'm selling industrial gases that are commodities Hydrogen is hydrogen How can I ever make money just selling a commodity gas? Particularly when I'm selling to a lot of customers who often have bargaining power they're big manufacturing companies Industrial gases are made with feedstocks like, you know petrochemicals and I have no control over the price of the feedstock So if the feed stock price goes up, I'm in trouble if I'm selling a commodity gas", "start": 1170.0, "heat": 0.489}, {"text": " Again not so good element of the industry You know, it's not not that hard to get in I mean lots of people can figure out use the figure out how to make helium or hydrogen and Have a little facility in the in the in the factory And many of the customers decide. Well, this is not something I want to buy. I want to make my own industrial gases in-house and Make them right right in my factory right on the production line. Ok. So again, here's an industry your first look says Not so good. I don't want to play here. That's your first instinct but again what we learn about industry analysis is we've got to we've got to be sophisticated We can't just take the superficial look at the industry, we've got to dig down a little bit and if we dig down in this industry, what we've learned is actually it's quite an exciting and interesting industries in fact the companies in this industry have done very well and the reason is that the superficial look doesn't really get at the true industry structure so just an example is the Probably the most interesting thing about the industry is that the cost of transportation are very high? To move gas from your plant to your customer takes a big truck", "start": 1260.0, "heat": 0.442}, {"text": " It's very expensive to ship It's got to be shipped under pressure And you have to kind of have a big tanker truck and it has to go to the customer side and it has to unload the gas through you know pumping it into the tank there and Transport cost Means that in order to be efficient in this industry, you have to have density of customers so if you have you have only one customer in Mumbai and you have to drive all the way to Mumbai for one customer and spend all that money to drive that truck full of helium here and you get to Offload a little bit for one customer. Your costs are going to be very high but if you come to Mumbai and you have 17 customers and your trucks from one to the next to the next and they're all close by Then actually that makes your business super efficient Compared to the guy who's only going to deliver to one or two customers Transportation costs take a very superficially lousy industry and make it into a very attractive industry Because all of a sudden If you have a dense group of customers in a given market, it's almost impossible for your competitor to attack you It's just too expensive.

So again, I won't go through the details But what I'm trying to get across here is that we all have to be really sophisticated at industry analysis in our businesses We got a look below the surface. We can't we can't just say oh, this is a commodity. It's allows the industry. Uh-uh It's a commodity. It's quite an attractive industry dig down understand the real entry barriers Understand that the the real bargaining power of the customer and the supplier And and and the people that could see this have built tremendous businesses in industry that nobody else wanted to go into for the stock market thought this was a crummy industry for a long time boy, were they wrong The investors that could understand how attractive this business was boy, did they do well again You know what? What we find in in competition is the that actually the concepts themselves are not that complicated but actually applying them well is really hard and", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.419}, {"text": " That applies both to the companies but also to the investors that are trying to figure out whether a company is successful or will be successful How do we achieve superior profitability in the industry Whatever the industry attractiveness looks like well that has to do with with the two fundamental types of competitive damage And and this never changes and never will change there's only two ways to get in advance one is to differentiate yourself Do something better? Customer will pay you more for it Because you're delivering some something the customer thinks is better It could be designed it could be image it could be functionality, it could be service. It could be almost anything But you know competitive advantage number one is differentiating and getting a higher price and If you're differentiating you better get a higher price Because if you're not getting a higher price, then you have to ask, are we really differentiating if nobody's willing to pay us extra? are we really better and That's a kind of a tough honest question we have to ask ourselves. The other kind of competitive advantage is lower cost If we can actually do something cheaper and more efficiently", "start": 1530.0, "heat": 0.329}, {"text": " and and that's not just luck that's not just oh we bought a lower cost parts this week But if we can find a way of structurally being lower cost because we've redesigned the way we do things That's the other kind of competitive advantage And really the broadest thinking about strategy starts with okay which path are we on? Are we we on the path to differentiate? Are we on a path to be the lowest cost? Those are both good pass depending on the circumstances but we we gotta usually decide which path we're gonna be on because if we're gonna really differentiate and have better quality and better service and You know better educated Salesforce. It's gonna be hard to at the same time be lower cost That's what we've learned so we've got to figure out what path were on And then we have to turn it into a strategy using the value chain And again, I hope everybody here is familiar with that concept it's quite embedded now and management thinking the value chain says You know for any business there's a whole set of things that we have to do in order to conduct that business Logistical things, operating things which could be manufacturing, marketing, sales service, supply chain", "start": 1620.0, "heat": 0.246}, {"text": " Technology development you see this and and this this this idea called the value chain is a way of mapping What what operation in this industry looks like?

It's simply a set of choices about how we are going to operate the business Including choices about the technology we're gonna sell you know, The function of our product the features of our product the technology of our product and A good strategy is one where there's clarity on the choices we are really making and There's enough things that we're doing differently that we can get a competitive advantage So let's talk a little bit more of that about that The first kind of key idea here in going from kind of a value chain to strategy is the notion of operational effectiveness versus strategic position This is a idea that I didn't have when I first published my first work books in this field", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.412}, {"text": " I was thinking mostly about strategy but but I I didn't really make make the distinction That there's a lot that a company does that isn't strategy There's a lot of best practice If we're going to be in the auto industry, there's a lot of things we have to do just to be a good auto company You know, we have to buy the right kind of machines for our factory we have to have you know, a decent dealer network we have to You know learn how to execute good advertising.
