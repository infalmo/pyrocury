[{"text": "You've tested positive for a rare and deadly\ncancer that afflicts 1 out of 1000 people,based on a test that is 99% accurate. What\nare the chances that you actually have thecancer? By the end of this video, you'll be\nable to answer this question!This video is part of the Probability and\nStatistics video series. Many natural andsocial phenomena are probabilistic in nature.\nEngineers, scientists, and policymakers oftenuse probability to model and predict system\nbehavior.Hi, my name is Sam Watson, and I'm a graduate\nstudent in mathematics at MIT.Before watching this video, you should be\nfamiliar with basic probability vocabularyand the definition of conditional probability.After watching this video, you'll be able\nto: Calculate the conditional probabilityof a given event using tables and trees; and\nUnderstand how conditional probability canbe used to interpret medical diagnoses.Suppose that in front of you are two bowls,\nlabeled A and B. Each bowl contains five marbles.Bowl A has 1 blue and 4 yellow marbles. Bowl\nB has 3 blue and 2 yellow marbles.Now choose a bowl at random and draw a marble\nuniformly at random from it. Based on yourexisting knowledge of probability, how likely\nis it that you pick a blue marble? How abouta yellow marble?Out of \nthe 10 marbles you could choose from, 4 are\nblue. So the probability of choosing a bluemarble is 4 out of 10.There are 6 yellow marbles out of 10 total,\nso the probability of choosing yellow is 6", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.124}, {"text": "out of 10.When the number of possible outcomes is finite,\nand all events are equally likely, the probabilityof one event happening is the number of favorable\noutcomes divided by the total number of possibleoutcomes.What if you must draw from Bowl A? What's\nthe probability of drawing a blue marble,given that you draw from Bowl A?Let's go back to the table and consider only\nBowl A. Bowl A contains 5 marbles of which1 is blue, so the probability of picking a\nblue one is 1 in 5.Notice the probability has changed. In the\nfirst scenario, the sample space consistsof all 10 marbles, because we are free to\ndraw from both bowls.In the second scenario, we are restricted\nto Bowl A. Our new sample space consists ofonly the five marbles in Bowl A. We ignore\nthese marbles in Bowl.Restricting our attention to a specific set\nof outcomes changes the sample space, andcan also change the probability of an event.\nThis new probability is what we call a conditionalIn the previous example, we calculated the\nconditional probability of drawing a bluemarble, given that we draw from Bowl A.This is standard notation for conditional\nprobability. The vertical bar ( | ) is readas \"given.\" The probability we are looking\nfor precedes the bar, and the condition followsthe bar.Now let's flip things around. Suppose someone\npicks a marble at random from either bowlA or bowl B and reveals to you that the marble\ndrawn was blue. What is the probability thatthe blue marble came from Bowl A?In other words, what's the conditional probability\nthat the marble was drawn from Bowl A, giventhat it is blue? Pause the video and try to\nwork this out.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.125}, {"text": "Going back to the table, because we are dealing\nwith the condition that the marble is blue,the sample space is restricted to the four\nblue marbles.Of these four blue marbles, one is in Bowl\nA, and each is equally likely to be drawn.Thus, the conditional probability is 1 out\nof 4.Notice that the probability of picking a blue\nmarble given that the marble came from BowlA is NOT equal to the probability that the\nmarble came from Bowl A given that the marblewas blue. Each has a different condition,\nso be careful not to mix them up!We've seen how tables can help us organize\nour data and visualize changes in the samplespace.Let's look at another tool that is useful\nfor understanding conditional probabilities- a tree diagram.Suppose we have a jar containing 5 marbles;\n2 are blue and 3 are yellow. If we draw anyone marble at random, the probability of drawing\na blue marble is 2/5.Now, without replacing the first marble, draw\na second marble from the jar. Given that thefirst marble is blue, is the probability of\ndrawing a second blue marble still 2/5?NO, it isn't. Our sample space has changed.\nIf a blue marble is drawn first, you are leftwith 4 marbles; 1 blue and 3 yellow.In other words, if a blue marble is selected\nfirst, the probability that you draw bluesecond is 1/4. And the probability you draw\nyellow second is 3/4.Now pause the video and determine the probabilities\nif the yellow marble is selected first instead.If a yellow marble is selected first, you\nare left with 2 yellow and 2 blue marbles.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "There is now a 2/4 chance of drawing a blue\nmarble and a 2/4 chance of drawing a yellowmarble.What we have drawn here is called a tree diagram.\nThe probability assigned to the second branchdenotes the conditional probability given\nthat the first happened.Tree diagrams help us to visualize our sample\nspace and reason out probabilities.We can answer questions like \"What is the\nprobability of drawing 2 blue marbles in arow?\" In other words, what is the probability\nof drawing a blue marble first AND a bluemarble second?This event is represented by these two branches\nin the tree diagram.We have a 2/5 chance followed by a 1/4 chance.\nWe multiply these to get 2/20, or 1/10. Theprobability of drawing two blue marbles in\na row is 1/10.Now you do it. Use the tree diagram to calculate\nthe probabilities of the other possibilities:blue, yellow; yellow, blue; and yellow, yellow.The probabilities each work out to 3/10. The\nfour probabilities add up to a total of 1,as they should.What if we don't care about the first marble?\nWe just want to determine the probabilitythat the second marble is yellow.Because it does not matter whether the first\nmarble is blue or yellow, we consider boththe blue, yellow, and the yellow, yellow paths.\nAdding the probabilities gives us 3/10 + 3/10,which works out to 3/5.Here's another interesting question. What\nis the probability that the first marble drawnis blue, given that the second marble drawn\nis yellow?Intuitively, this seems tricky. Pause the\nvideo and reason through the probability treewith a friend.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Because we are conditioning on the event that\nthe second marble drawn is yellow, our samplespace is restricted to these two paths: P(blue,\nyellow) and P(yellow, yellow).Of these two paths, only the top one meets\nour criteria - that the blue marble is drawnfirst.We represent the probability as a fraction\nof favorable to possible outcomes. Hence,the probability that the first marble drawn\nis blue, given that the second marble drawnis yellow is 3/10 divided by (3/10 +3/10),\nwhich works out to 1/2.I hope you appreciate that tree diagrams and\ntables make these types of probability problemsdoable without having to memorize any formulas!Let's return to our opening question. Recall\nthat you've tested positive for a cancer thatafflicts 1 out of 1000 people, based on a\ntest that is 99% accurate.More precisely, out of 100 test results, we\nexpect about 99 correct results and only 1incorrect result.Since the test is highly accurate, you might\nconclude that the test is unlikely to be wrong,and that you most likely have cancer.But wait! Let's first use conditional probability\nto make sense of our seemingly gloomy diagnosis.Now pause the video and determine the probability\nthat you have the cancer, given that you testpositive.Let's use a tree diagram to help with our\ncalculations.The first branch of the tree represents the\nlikelihood of cancer in the general population.The probability of having the rare cancer\nis 1 in 1000, or 0.001. The probability ofhaving no cancer is 0.999.Let's extend the tree diagram to illustrate\nthe possible results of the medical test thatis 99% accurate.In the cancer population, 99% will test positive\n(correctly), but 1% will test negative (incorrectly).These incorrect results are called false negatives.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "In the cancer-free population, 99% will test\nnegative (correctly), but 1% will test positive(incorrectly). These incorrect results are\ncalled false positives.Given that you test positive, our sample space\nis now restricted to only the population thattest positive. This is represented by these\ntwo paths.The top path shows the probability you have\nthe cancer AND test positive. The lower pathshows the probability that you don't have\ncancer AND still test positive.The probability that you \nactually do have the cancer, given that you\ntest positive, is (0.001*0.99)/((0.001*0.99)+(0.999*0.01)),which works out to about 0.09 - less than\n10%!The error rate of the test is only 1 percent,\nbut the chance of a misdiagnosis is more than90%! Chances are pretty good that you do not\nactually have cancer, despite the rather accuratetest. Why is this so?The accuracy of the test actually reflects\nthe conditional probability that one testspositive, given that one has cancer.But in practice, what you want to know is\nthe conditional probability that you havecancer, given that you test positive! These\nprobabilities are NOT the same!Whenever we take medical tests, or perform\nexperiments, it is important to understandwhat events our results are conditioned on,\nand how that might affect the accuracy ofour conclusions.In this video, you've seen that conditional\nprobability must be used to understand andpredict the outcomes of many events. You've\nalso learned to evaluate and manage conditional", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "probabilities using tables and trees.We hope that you will now think more carefully\nabout the probabilities you encounter, andconsider how conditioning affects their interpretation.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.124}]
