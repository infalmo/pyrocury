Oh now,let me push, this is\na serious question.If I took all\ntheir combinations.So let me try to\ndraw a little bit.Okay.I'm in three-dimensional\nspace and u goes somewhere,maybe there and v goes\nsomewhere, maybe here.Now suppose I take\nall the combinations,so I could multiply\nthat first guyby any number, that\nwould fill the line.I can multiply that second\nguy, v.

this\nfact of-- if we onlyknow the differences-- Yeah.You can see different ways\nthat this has got problems.So that's C times x.Now one way to see\na problem is to saywe can get the answer of all\nzeroes by putting constants.All that's saying in\nwords the differencesof a constant factor\nare all zeroes, right?That's all that happened.Another way to see a problem if\nI had this system of

allowed\nto do that, right?If I've got three equations\nI'm allowed to add them,and I would get zero, if I\nadd, I get zero equals --I have to add the right-sides\nof course -- b_1+b_2+b_3.I hesitate

get an answerand when I couldn't.If I get zero on\nthe left side I haveto have zero on the\nright side or I'm lost.So I could actually solve\nthis when b_1+b_2+b_3=0.So I've taken a step there.I've said that okay,\nwe're in trouble often,but in case the right-side\nadds up to zero then we're not.And if you'll allow me to\njump to a mechanical meaningof this, if these were\nsprings or something, masses,and these were forces on\nthem -- so I'm solvingfor displacements of masses\nthat we'll see very soon,and these are forces -- what\nthat equation is saying is,because they're sorta cyclical,\nit's somehow saying thatif the forces add up to zero,\nif the resulting force is zero,then you're okay.The springs and masses don't\nlike take off, or startspinning or whatever.So there's a physical\nmeaning for that conditionthat it's okay provided,\nif, the b's add up to zero.But of course, if the b's don't\nadd up to zero we're lost.Right yeah.Okay.So Cx=b could be solved\nsometimes,

back x.But here there's no\nway to bring backthat x because I can't\nmultiply zero by anythingand get back to x.So that's why I see\nit's got troubles here.Here I see it's got troubles\nbecause if I

look at it.All these vectors\nare on the plane.Do the components\nof u add to zero?Look at u.Yes.Do the components\nof v add to zero?Yes.Add them up.Do the components of w*, now\nthat you've fixed it correctly,do they add to zero?Yes.So all the combinations\nwill add to zero.That's the plane.That's the plane.You see there are so many\ndifferent ways to see,and none of this is\ndifficult, but

okay.I wanted to give you this\nexample, the two examples,because they bring out\nso many of the key ideas.The key idea of a subspace.Shall I just say a little\nabout what that word means?A subspace.What's a subspace?Well, what's a vector\nspace first of all?A vector space is\na bunch of vectors.And the rule is you\nhave to be able to taketheir combinations.That what linear algebra does.Takes combinations.So a vector space is one where\nyou take all combinations.So if I only took just this\ntriangle that would notbe a subspace because one\ncombination would be 2uand it would be out\nof the triangle.So a subspace, just\nthink of it as a plane,but then of course it could\nbe in higher dimensions.You know it could be a\n7-dimensional subspaceinside a 15-dimensional space.And I don't know if you're good\nat visualizing that, I'm not.Never mind.You you've got seven\nvectors, you think okay,their combinations give us\nseven-dimensional subspace.Each factor has 15 components.No problem.I mean no problem\nfor MATLAB certainly.It's got what, a matrix\nwith a 105 entries.It deals with that instantly.Okay, so a subspace is like a\nvector space inside a bigger", "start": 2520.0,

the smallest\nsubspace of R^3?So I have 3-dimensional\nspace-- you can tell me allthe subspaces of R^3.So there is one, a plane.Yeah, tell me all\nthe subspaces of R^3.And then you'll have\nthat word kind of down.AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]PROFESSOR STRANG: A line.So planes and lines,\nthose you could say,the real, the proper subspaces.The best, the right ones.But there are a couple more\npossibilities which are?AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]PROFESSOR STRANG: A point.Which point?The origin.Only the origin.Because if you tried to say that\npoint was a subspace, no way.Why not?Because I wouldn't\nbe able to multiplythat vector by five and I\nwould be away from the point.But the zero subspace,\nthe really small subspacethat just has the zero vector,\nit's got one vector in it.Not empty.It's got that one\npoint but that's all.Okay, so planes,\nlines, the origin,and then the other possibility\nfor a subspaces is?The whole space.Right.Right.So the dimensions could be\nthree for the whole space,two for a plane, one for\na line, zero for a point.It just kicks together.How are we for time?Maybe I went more than half, but\nnow is a chance to just ask me,if you want to,

rectangular\nmatrices A, okay.They're not invertible.They're taking\nseven-dimensional spaceto three-dimensional\nspace or something.You can't invert that.What comes up every time-- I\nsort of got the idea finally.Every time I see a rectangular\nmatrix, maybe seven by three,that would be seven\nrows by three columns.Then what comes up with\na rectangular matrixA is sooner or later A\ntranspose sticks its nose inand multiplies that A. And we\ncouldn't do it for our A here.Actually if I did it for\nthat original matrix AI would get something\nyou'd recognize.What I want to say is\nthat the course focuseson A transpose A.
