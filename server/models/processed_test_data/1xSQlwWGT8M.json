And you'd\nsay, oh, four protons,that is beryllium.Right there.And the atomic number is the\nnumber that you see up there.And that' s literally the\nnumber of protons.And that is what differentiatesone atom from another.If you have fifteen protons,\nyou're dealing withphosphorus.And all of a sudden, if you\nhave seven protons, you'redealing with nitrogen.If you have eight, you're\ndealing with oxygen.That is what defines\nthe element.Now, we'll talk in the future\nabout what happens with chargeand all of that.Or what happens when you\ngain or lose electrons.But that does not change what\nelement you're dealing with.And likewise, when you change\nthe number of neutrons, thatalso does not change the element\nyou're dealing with.But that leads to an obvious\nquestion of, well, how manyneutrons and electrons\ndo you have?Well, if an atom is\ncharge-neutral, that means ithas the same number\nof electrons.So let's say that\nI have carbon.Its atomic number is six.And let's say its mass\nnumber is twelve.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Now what does this mean?And let me say further that this\nis a neutral particle.This is a neutral atom.So the atomic number\nfor carbon is six.That tells us exactly how\nmany protons it has.So if I were to draw a little\nmodel here, and this is in noway an accurate model.I'll draw six-- two, three,\nfour, five, sixprotons in the center.And the weight of these protons,\neach proton is oneatomic mass unit, and we'll\ntalk more about how thatrelates to kilograms.\nIt's a very smallfraction of a kilogram.Roughly I think it's\n1.6 times 10 to theminus 27th of a kilogram.So let's say each of these are\none atomic mass unit, andthat's approximately equal to,\nI think, 1.67 times 10 to theminus 27 kilograms.
