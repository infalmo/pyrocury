of the kind ofindifference curve and\nconstrained choice analysiswe've been doing, the\ncase of food stamps.And then we're going to move\non and talk about derivingdemand curves.So let's talk about\nfood stamps.It's an interesting case.This is a policy that's been in\nplace in the US governmentfor a very long time, which are\nessentially coupons thatindividuals can use\nto buy food.It used to literally\nbe coupons.It used to literally, you'd\nget a stamp, a coupon, andyou'd go to the supermarket and\nhand this in instead ofcash to buy your goods.Now it's actually\na debit card.And it's given to low-income\nindividuals as a way ofredistributing income\nin society.So individuals of income below\na certain level, typically,say, a family with income below\nabout $25,000 a year,below what we call the US\npoverty line, will be eligiblefor food stamps, which is a\ndebit card they can use tocharge their food purchases.Now, what I want to talk about\ntoday is how we can use thekind of analysis we've done so\nfar to think about the effectof food stamps.So let's start with\nfigure 6-1.And let's think about someone\nwith an original budget line.If someone has a budget line,\nthey have income of $1,000.OK, a very poor person, they\nhave income of $1,000.And let's talk about them, their\nchoices between food andall other goods.Once again we have\nthis analysis.We put everything in\ntwo dimensions.What we think about is via\nmental accounting, as wetalked about last time.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "However you want to justify it\nto yourself, the way we modelit is thinking about people\nhaving this choice along twodimensions, food and other\ngoods, and theyhave income of $1000.Let's say we'll have\ntwo individuals,individual x and y.Individual x doesn't care\nthat much about food.They really like consuming\nother goods.So they spend $600 of their\nincome on othergoods and $400 on food.Individual y cares\na lot about food.They end up spending $900\nof their budget on food.And that should be 100.100 on other goods.So that y-intercept should\nbe 100 for person y.So they spend 900 on food\nand 100 on other goods.Now let's say the government\ncomes in and wants to considertwo options.The government decides, look,\nwe want to help poor people.And particularly we want to give\npeople like these people$500 in resources.Let's think of two different\nways thegovernment could do that.One way the government\ncould do it is itcould give them cash.It could say, look, we're\ngoing to sendyou a check for $500.What would that do to their\nbudget constraint?Well that would shift it out, as\nwe talked about last time.It would be an outward shift\nof $500 at every point.So their new budget constraint\nwould be the line that runsfrom $1,500 of all other goods\nto $1,500 dollars in food.So include that.So both the solid and dashed\nportions would be their newbudget constraint.So the new budget constraint\nwould run from 1,500 to 1,500.Person x would choose to\nmove from x1 to x2.I'm sorry, they would choose\nto move from x1.It's not labeled as a point.But they would actually choose\nto move from indifferencecurve 2 to indifference\ncurve 3.OK, that's where they'd choose\nto move if they could choosealong this entire line.Let me sort of, well, I'm not\ngoing to draw it, because I'lldo a bad job.But basically, if you can think\nabout the new budgetconstraint running from 1,500 to\n1,500, person x would movefrom indifference curve 2\nto indifference curve 3.They would choose--", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.253},

an original budget\nline that runs from1,000 to 1,000.And we've got person x up here,\nand they're choosing tospend 400 on food and\n600 on other goods.And we've got person\ny down here.This is person x, and they're\nin section x1.And person y intercepts at y1\nwhere they choose to spend 900on food and 100 on\nother goods.Now, the government first says,\nlook, we're going togive people $500 in cash.That just shifts the budget\nconstraint out parallel, butnow runs from 1,500 to 1,500.Let's say that the choices\npeople make--Person x would say, great, I'm\ngoing to take that money, I'mgoing to spend almost all\nof it on other goods.So I'm going to move to a point\nlike x2, where I'm goingto consume $1,200 on--I'm going to consume--They were consuming--No, I'm sorry.15, right.They're going to move from\nspending $600 on other goodsand $400 on food to spending\n$1,100 of their dollars onother goods, and--let me think for a second.Let's say they would\ngo vertically.So let's say they'd choose\nto spend allof it on other goods.So they'd take the whole 500,\nand they'd go from spending--they'd continue to spend 400 on\nfood, but now they'd spend1,100 on other goods.So person x,

spending $100 on\nother goods, I'll spend $300on other goods.OK, so that's person y2.OK, so that's what they'd do if\nwe gave them $500 in cash.Now say the government came in\nand said, you know, we'regoing to give you $500 but in\nthe form of a coupon that youcan spend on food.So the first question is, what\ndoes that do to the budgetconstraint?This is a bit tricky.We've got to think about this.Think about their budget\nconstraint.What that says is for anyone who\nwants to continue to, atleast spend $1,000 on--anyone who wants to at least\nspend $500 on food, it doesnot change their opportunities\nat all.So the new budget constraint\nlooks like this.It's a solid line to here,\nand then it goes down.This intersects at 500.It's a solid line to the point\nat $500, and then it goes downand follows the old\nbudget constraint.Why does it do that?Because for anyone to this side,\nthey are $500 richerregardless of whether you\ngive them cash or food.Either way they're\n$500 richer.Why?Because as long as you intended\nto spend $500 on foodanyway, it doesn't matter the\nform in which the governmentgives you the money.Think about that for a second.It's very important.If you were going to spend $500\non food anyway, it doesnot matter if the government\ngives you a check for 500, ora food card for 500.Why is that?That's because your budget\nis what we call fungible.You can

can just take some of the\ncash on food, spend it onother things, and use the card\nfor the food instead.So for them, there's no\ndifference in giving them cashor giving them the food card.It has the same effect.They move to y2 either way.Now let's take a\nperson like x.Well, if you gave them cash,\n$500 cash, they'd spend noneof it on food.So they've been consuming\n$1,100 of othergoods and $400

move\nto a point like x3 wherethey have to go to this\nintersection.Because this point is\nnot attainable.This point is not attainable.If you give them food stamps,\nthe new budgetconstraint is this.So x2 is no longer attainable.They have to move to\na point like x3.So what do we know about their\nlevel of happinessat x3 versus x2?Someone raise their\nhand and tell me.Yeah.AUDIENCE: It's

before, thenby revealed preference they're\nless well off.We've revealed that they're\nworse, because they could havechosen this point before,\nbut they didn't.When you gave them the cash,\nthey chose this point.So by revealed preference we\nrevealed they're worse off.So it's the same\nas saying theirindifference curve is lower.We've revealed they're\nworse off.So what we've learned is for\nperson y, they don't care ifyou give them cash or a food\ncard, food stamps.It's called food stamps, but\nit's now a debit card.Person x is made worse off if\nyou give them the food stampsinstead of the

need.PROFESSOR: Or to put it more\nsuccinctly, what if this axiswas not labeled other goods\nbut labeled cocaine.Then we might be sad that you\ntook the whole $500 and spentit on cocaine.We might want you to take that\n$500 and spend it on food.So it's paternalism.The reason we give the guys food\nstamps instead of cash iswe don't trust them\nwith the cash.If we trusted people with the\ncash, there'd be no reason notto give them the cash.We are unambiguously making them\nworse off by forcing themto consume a bundle that's on\na lower utility curve, lower", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.252},

are we costing them?In fact, it's not obvious.If everyone in the world looks\nlike y, then there's no costto food stamps.There's no good done either.Then it doesn't matter if we\ngive them cash or food stamps.But if a lot of people look\nlike x, then there is awelfare cost to people.They are worse off, from\ntheir own perspective,getting food stamps.Society may think they're\nbetter off.So how do we tell?How do we tell?Can anyone take a guess?If you're now an empirical\neconomist, and you want totest, how would you tell if\npeople are like x or like y?Any ideas?It's tricky, but let's see if we\nhave any budding empiricaleconomists here.Yeah?AUDIENCE: You'd see if they're\nspending any cash beyond the$500 that you gave them, because\nthen you'd basically[UNINTELLIGIBLE].PROFESSOR: See if they're buying\nfood beyond the $500you gave them.AUDIENCE: They might spend\n$100 cash on food.PROFESSOR: Excellent.So that's one way you'd do it.You could look at people who\nget food stamps and see ifthey're spending more.That's a great idea.The other thing you could\ndo is you could actuallyliterally run an experiment\nwhere you take people who aregetting food stamps and replace\nthem with cash or viceversa and see what happens\nto their behavior.When we do this, we find\nthat about 15% ofpeople are like x.Or in other words, the\nway to say it, isabout $0.15 more precisely.When you give people food stamps\ninstead of cash, theyspend 15% more on food than they\nwould if you just gavethem the cash.So there's about 15% lower\nutility compared to whatthey'd want for spending it on\nthe food instead of the cash.So the question is,\nis it worth it?We're basically taking people\nand making them spend $0.15more on food than\nthey'd want to.That's the right way\nto think about it.If you

nobody would waste\nthe money, then we're justthrowing $0.15 down the toilet\nby making them buy foodinstead of goods they prefer.And that's the interesting kind\nof public policy questionwe have to struggle with.We think about government policy\nand redistribution.That's exactly the kind\nof question weneed to struggle with.And we'll come back to that\nagain later in the course whenwe talk about efficiency\nversus equity.OK, questions about that?Yeah?AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].PROFESSOR: Sure.I mean, so basically you\nmake a good point.We sort of like to know.Actually that's a\nvery good point.You say, when we run these\nexperiments and replace thefood stamps with cash,\nwe like to know whatthey spend the cash.We want to know not just what\nhappens to food consumption.So if you run the experiment,\nand you say, I was giving youfood stamps.I now cash you out and\ngive you cash.And I find you spend\n15% less on food.Well what do you\nspend more on?If it's clothes, maybe\nwe're not so worried.If it's cocaine, maybe we are.So that's a very good point.That's something we\ncould look at.Excellent.OK, so that's an example of\nhow we can use the kind ofanalysis we did last time to\nthink about policy making.Once again, this is\nan incrediblysimple framework, right?Yet I just described to you a\nsuccinct way to think aboutthe implications for society ofdifferent government policies.That's the power of this kind\nof simplified framework.Now let's move on, and let's\nget to the core ofwhy we did all this.The reason we did all this is we\nwanted to figure out how wecome up with demand curves,\nwhere demand curves come from.The stork doesn't bring them.Demand curves come from\nunderlying utilitymaximization.And we'll see that now.And basically the way to do\nthis is to return to ourexample from last time.Your parents gave you $96.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.116}, {"text": "You could buy movies at $8 a\npop or pizzas at $16 a pop.So we said last time,\nif you turn to thenext page of the handout.What we said last time is if\ngiven your utility function, uequals square root of p times\nm, you would choosea point like a.If the price of pizzas was $16,\nthe price of movies was$8, your income was $96, you\nwould choose a point like a,where you consumed--At point a, you're consuming six\nmovies and three pizzas.Once again that should\nbe p on the y-axis.You're consuming six movies and\nthree pizzas at point a.Now let's say the price\nof pizzas rises.I'm sorry, now let's say the\nprice of movies rises to $12.So the price of movies\nrises from $8 to $12.Well what does that do to\nthe budget constraint?That steepens the budget\nconstraint, moves it inward.Because now think about\nyour opportunity set.For the same income of $96 you\ncan buy the same number ofpizzas you could have before,\nbut now you'rebuying fewer movies.Same number of pizzas you could\nhave bought before, butnow you can buy fewer movies.So your new budget constraint,\nyou have a new

keep the number ofpizzas constant.And you check that we still\nspent our total budget.Well, 4 times 12 plus 3\ntimes 16 is still $96.So we're still spending\nour total budget.The marginal rate of\nsubstitution you can computeif you write it down from that\nutility function, will beminus 3/4, which is the same\nas the marginal rate oftransformation with\nthis new price.So you will choose a\npoint like point b.Now let's say instead\nthe price of moviesfell from $8 to $6.Well in that case, your budget\nconstraint would flatten.It would move outwards.Your opportunity set would\nexpand in that case, becauseeffectively you're richer.Your opportunity set expands.You move to bc little 3.You move to bc little 3.And given those preferences I\nwrote down, u equals squareroot of p times m.u

substitution, you cancompute, will equal the\nnew marginal rate oftransformation.And also you can see you spend\nyour entire $96 income.You're still roughly splitting\nit with $48 on movies and $48on pizza, exactly\nsplitting it.So all we've done here--Forget the bottom diagram\nfor a second.All we're doing in this top\ndiagram is saying, given yourutility is u equals square root\nof p times m and

demand curve.Because what have we done?We've just given you three\ndifferent prices for moviesand three different quantities\nof movies you choose.We know when the price\nof movies was $8,you chose six movies.That's point b.I'm sorry, that's point a.The points are mislabeled\ntoo on this.I'm sorry.If you go to this bottom\ngraph, these points aremislabeled.So it should go b, a, c.It should go b,

lesson.There's the price of one good\nchanges the other goodsunaffected.In fact, in general, both goods\nwill be affected whenany one price changes.That's a more general result.You should be able to

still get this flat\ncurve-- well now it will bevertical curve with respect\nto movie purchases.But you can see as you change\nthe price of pizzas, you'llfind a well-defined pizza\ndemand curve as

many\nmovies you choose and theprice of movies.Demand curves themselves\ncan also shift.We talked about that in\nthe second lecture.We talked about demand\ncurve shifting.And one reason demand\ncurves can shift isbecause you get richer.So let's talk about how\nthat can happen.Let's now turn to figure 6-3,\nwhich is really tiny.My bifocals are in\nat the mall.I just haven't picked\nthem up yet.So

can now afford up to 8\nmovies and up to 16 pizzaswith your $128 income.So your budget constraint\nhas shiftedoutwards from bc1 to bc2.At that new higher budget\nconstraint, you're going tochoose,

you don't want as much\nmore as you get richer.So you've got the food as\nthe classic example.As your income doubles, you're\ngoing to eat more food but nottwice as much food.Likewise luxuries are things\nwhere as your income doubles,you'll buy more than\ntwice as much.So you think about fancy cars.You might buy one with your\nfirst million but three withyour next million.So those are luxuries.They'll increase more than\nproportionally asyour income goes up.Necessities will increase less\nthan proportionally as yourincome goes up.Now, of course, it's a very\nhard distinction to draw.And of course it varies\nby person.So take clothing.Is clothing a necessity\nor a luxury?Well, some clothing is probably\na necessity, and someclothing is probably a luxury.You know, Dolce and

like,own-price elasticity?PROFESSOR: Actually that's\na great question.That's a great segue to what\nwe're going to do next.It's actually a fundamental\ndeterminant of own-priceelasticity, and we'll\ntalk about why next.Other questions about\nthis concept?Yeah.AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]?PROFESSOR: Yes, income\nelasticity is, once again,just like price elasticities are\nnot necessarily constant.You could have a constant income\nelasticity curve or anon-constant income\nelasticity curve.It can absolutely change.In general it will.But it might not.Good questions.But that other question in the\nback, gee, how does thisrelate to own-price\nelasticity?Great segue.In fact the income effect is\ngoing to be one of two keydeterminants of own-price\nelasticity.Now what we're going to do is\nwe're going to go even furtherbehind the demand curve.We talked about the demand\ncurve comes from.We talked before about how the\nslope of the demand curve isthe price elasticity.Remember, the price elasticity\nwas the slope.Now we're going to talk\nabout where doesthe slope come from.Where do price elasticities\ncome from?So I've shown you where the\ndemand curve comes from.Now let's talk about what\ndetermines the underlyingslope of the demand curve.What determines the\nprice elasticity.And what's going to determine\nit is two different effectswhich work generally together\nbut sometimes in opposition.There are two effects that\ndetermine price elasticity.The first is the substitution\neffect.", "start": 1920.0, "heat": 0.257}, {"text": "The Substitution Effect is the\nchange in quantity demandedwhen price increases holding\nutility constant.So the Substitution Effect\nis delta p--it's in percentage terms-- delta\np over p, over delta qover q, holding

expensive, howdo you shift away\nfrom that good?Think of this as the\nshift away from thegood as it gets expensive.But at the same time, there's a\nsecond effect which we justintroduced, which is\nthe Income Effect.The Income Effect is the\ncomplement of the SubstitutionEffect, which is the change in\nquantity demanded because of achange in income holding\nprices constant.So this is the Income Effect\nwe just introduced.So it's delta Q over Q\nover delta y over y.But this is holding\nprices constant.And these two put together\ndetermine yourown elasticity demand.Think of it intuitively.We'll do it intuitively,\nand graphically, andmathematically.Intuitively, it's when a price\ngoes up, two things happen.On the one hand, you're like,\ngee, at that different priceratio, I

itintuitively.The graphics kind of makes\nit the most clear.We're going to start\nat a point like a.Point a is our initial\nequilibrium at our budgetconstraint one, where\nwe're choosing sixmovies and three pizzas.Once again, this is\npizzas not CDs.We're choosing six movies\nand three pizzas.That's at point a.Now we're going to say imagine\nthe price of movieshas risen to $12.Well we know that ultimately\nyou'll end up ata point like c.We demonstrated that before.That was when we derived the\ndemand curve for movies.We know that if the price of\nmovies rises from $8 to $12,your demand for movies\nwill shrink from sixmovies to four movies.We already established that.But now what we can see is\nthat that's actually acomposition of two effects.The first effect is the\nSubstitution Effect.And the Substitution Effect is\nthe change in prices holdingutility constant.How do we hold utility\nconstant?You have to be on the same\nindifference curve.So the way to measure the\nSubstitution Effect is weeffectively draw an imaginary\nbudget constraint.We say, look, imagine you're\non the same indifferencecurve, but prices changed.So we draw budget constraint--you're originally on budget\nconstraint one.", "start": 2160.0, "heat": 0.214}, {"text": "Now we draw a new budget\nconstraint,budget constraint three.Budget constraint three, it's\nsort of hard to

let me just\nwalk this through again.You've got your original budget\nconstraint, bc 1.You chose your point a.Now the price of movies has just\nincreased, so you move tobc2 in reality.And at bc2, you choose\npoint c.But for the Substitution Effect\nwe're going to say,let's hold utility constant\nand ask what package you'dchoose at these new price\nholding utility constant?Well the way to do that is to\ndraw an imaginary bc3--bc3 never existed in reality--that is parallel to the new\nbudget constraint, that is thenew set of prices, but it's\ntangent to your oldindifference curve, that\nis utility is constant.If that were the case,\nyou'd choose point b.You'd choose 4.89 movies.Therefore we say that the\nSubstitution Effect is 1.11.We reduce your movies by 1.11\nthrough the SubstitutionEffect only.The price change only, holding\nyour income, holding utilityconstant, is 1.11.Then we say, well, what's\nthe Income Effect?The income effect is given\nprices are fixed, what's theeffect of just being poorer,\nbecause moviesare now more expensive.We know how to make\nsomeone poorer, wejust lower their income.So we shift from bc3 to bc2 and\nfrom point b to point c,and we're

minute.But let me first answer these\nquestions, then I want to showyou some of the math of this.Are there questions about\nwhat's going on here?Yeah.AUDIENCE: The income effect can\nhave either sign, right?PROFESSOR: The income effect\ncan have either sign.Excellent point.What have I illustrated here?What kind of good is this?This is a normal good.Excellent point.This is a normal good.I've assumed

more or less isrelated to the Income Effect but\ndoesn't tell you preciselywhat the Income Effect is.But as your income changes, if\nyou consume more or less,that's directly Income Effect.So we see it's a normal good.So the Substitution Effect\nmoves us from a to b.The Income Effect,\nfrom b to c.What I want to do is one more\nthing before we stop.And then I'm going to come back\nnext time and

or aninferior good.The Substitution Effect\nis unambiguous.Substitution Effects are\nalways negative.Holding utility constant, a\nprice increase of a goodalways shifts you away\nfrom that

up.That's graphically.Mathematically we can just say,\nlook, what do we know isour rule for utility\nmaximization?We know our rule for utility\nmaximization is that themarginal utility of movies over\nthe marginal utility ofprices equals the price of\nmovies over the price--marginal utility of pizza.I'm sorry.Marginal utility of pizza.So the price of movies,\nso the price of pizza.Or the MRS

right hand side rises,\nthen the left hand side has torise to get this equality.How does the left\nhand side rise?The left hand side rises by\neither the marginal utility ofmovies going up or the marginalutility of pizzas falling.And how do you do that?By shifting away from movies\ntowards pizza.", "start": 2520.0, "heat": 0.287}, {"text": "How do you make the marginal\nutility of movies go up?Consume fewer movies.How do you make the marginal\nutility of pizza go down?Consume more pizza.Now in this case, pizza\ndoesn't change in thisparticular case, but\nin general it can.But the key point is you are\ngoing to see this SubstitutionEffect is going to shift\nyou towards fewermovies to try to get--basically because given utility\nconstant, to try toequilibrate this, you're going\nto have to move to a highermarginal utility of movies.Given that the price of movies\nhas gone up, you're going tohave to move to worlds where you\ncare about movies more, oryou're not in equilibrium.Think about it this way.If the price of movies goes to\n$100 a movie, and you're goingto be indifferent to where you\nwere before, on the sameutilities you were before, it\ncan't possibly be true thatyou consume the same\nnumber of movies.You'd have to be sadder if you\nconsumed the same movies.You're going to have to\nmove away from movies.And that's why the SubstitutionEffect is always negative.You're always going to move away\nfrom the good where theprice increases, holding\nutility constant.But then we have the second\neffect with the Income Effect,which then basically, if the\ngood is normal, reinforcesthat Substitution Effect.It says not only do you not want\nmovies because they'vegotten more expensive, you also\ndon't want movies becauseyou're poorer.Your opportunity set's\nrestricted.And when your opportunity set's\nrestricted, you buy lessof everything including\nmovies.So there's two reasons.We only saw one own-price\nelasticity demand, one shift.But there's two reasons\nbehind that.The first reason is because therelative prices have changed.And the other is because you're\neffectively poorer.You add those up, and you\nget the final effect.Now the first,
