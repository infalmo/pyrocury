that as\nthe term progresses attendancein lecture tends to drop off.And gets pretty dramatic\nby the end of the termwhen you're lecturing,\nand nobody's there.And I asked him what\nhe did about it.And he thought about\nit and he said,there's only two things that\ncan get students to cometo lecture, candy and sex.Now we've already tried\ncandy, so today we'regoing to talk about sex.In fact we're going\nto use graph theoryto address a decades\nold debate concerningthe relative promiscuity\nof men versus women.Now graphs are incredibly useful\nstructures in computer science,and we're going to be studying\nthem for the next five or sixlectures.They come up in all sorts\nof applications, scheduling,optimization,\ncommunications, the designand analysis of algorithms.In fact next week, you're\ngoing to see how to Stanfordgraduate students\nbecame gazillionairesbecause they use graph\ntheoretic in a clever way.But let's talk about sex.The issue that we're\ngoing to address todayis one of the most talked\nabout, and most well studied,questions in all\nof human sociology.On average, who has more\nopposite gender partners,", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "men or women?Now opposite gender is\ngoing to be important.And by this I mean,\none boy, and one girl.All right, I'm not making\na political statement.It's just that the math is a lot\neasier that way, as you'll see.Now I'd like to start\nby taking a pole hereto see what you\nthink about that.So raise your and if you\nthink men, on average,have more opposite gender\npartners than women do.Only a few.AUDIENCE: In life or [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Um, you can--[LAUGHTER]PROFESSOR: One on one.OK, so let's say over the course\nof their lives, let's say,or over the course of\n2010, that men in Americahave more opposite-gender\npartners than women in America,say in 2010.Raise your hand if you think\nmen have more going on.All right a bunch of you.Raise your hand if\nyou think women havemore opposite-gender partners?This is unusual.Maybe even more voted for\nwomen, but it's close.Raise your hand if\nyou think it's equal.All right, about the same.Raise your hand if you think\nthere's no way to know,that it's hopeless to\nreally figure it out.All right, nobody goes for that.All right, good.All right well now in\nthe popular literature,I think the feelings are\ndifferent than expressed here.Pretty much universally,\nin the literature,it's believed that men have\nmore opposite-gender partnersthan women.And in fact, you\ncould even thinkabout that, if you\nthink about literature,the leader of the\nharem is always a man.And he's got lots of women.In polygamist\ncultures, it's alwaysthe man that has multiple\nwives, not the reverse.Now not surprisingly,\nthis issue hasbeen studied\n\"scientifically,\" I'llput in quotes, extensively, in\none of the largest studies everdone.Researchers from\nUniversity of Chicagointerviewed 2,500 people, at\nrandom, over several years.",

she\ntexted all of our friendsabout the new news\nthat what do you know,her dad teaches sex ed at MIT.Anyway this study concludes\nthat on average menhave 74% more opposite-gender\npartners than women.There's one other\ncentral claims.And this is in the US.OK now, when you think about it\nthat sounds maybe reasonable,might be OK.But not according to ABC News.They did a poll of 1,500\npeople

Peak Between the Sheets.That doesn't sound\nso scientific.And it was on TV, on\nPrimetime Live in 2004.The promo for this\nis really good.It says, a groundbreaking ABC\nNews Primetime Live surveyfinds a range of eye popping\nsexual activities, fantasies,and attitudes in this\ncountry, confirmingsome conventional wisdom,\nexploding some myths,and venturing where few\nscientific surveys havegone before.By the end of today,\nwe're going to agreewith that last statement.OK now who do you think's right?University of Chicago.Who votes for 74% as\nbeing pretty close?A few of you.I've already

you\ntackle this problem?In theory we could do\nour own 6.042 survey.I don't know how much\nwe'd really learn,and for sure I'd get fired.So I don't think we're\ngoing to do that.But fortunately, this\nis the kind of questionthat could be\nhandled, and actuallyanswered, by graph theory,\neven though it mightbe more interesting to\ninterview thousands of people,and find out what's going on.That's not as efficient\nas using graphs.So let me start by\ndefining what a graph is.Informally graph is just\na bunch of dots and linesconnecting the dots, it's\nactually very simple.So here's to graph.These are the nodes,\nand they're connectedwith these lines, called edges.And often the nodes,\nand sometimes the edges,are labeled.For example, we might call this\nx1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, and x7.So that's an example of a graph.Now this being a\nmath class, we gotto give a formal\ndefinition of a graph.And we'll usually use\nthe formal definition.A graph G is a pair of\nsets often called V and E.Where V is a set of elements\ncalled vertices or nodes.And it has to be non-empty\nhere in this class.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And we'll go back and forth\nbetween vertices and nodes.Even the text we use both\nwords interchangeably.And E is a set of\n2-item subsets and V,and they're called edges.So for example, over\nhere in this picture,V is the set of nodes is x1, x2,\nx3, up to x7, that's the nodes.And E, the set of\nedges, is pairs,unordered pairs of vertices.So for example\nx1, x2 is an edge.And it's the same\nas the set x2, x1,doesn't matter the order here.Later in a week or so, we'll\ntalk about directed graphswhere the order matters.x1, x3 is also an\nedge here, and so one.Think we've got, let's\nsee, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 edges in this graph.And the last one\nwould be x5, x7.Edges are also sometimes written\nwith this notation, x1 line x2,is another notation.And then later when you\ntalk about directed edges,we'll put a little arrowhead\non one end of this.Now the definition of a graph\nis really pretty simple.Just think of it as dots\nand lines, if you want.But there's often differences\nin how people define graphs.For example, in this class we\ndon't allow the empty graph,", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "i.e. the graph with no nodes.So we're going to insist\nthat every graph has to haveat least one node in it.And that's just to\nmake the theoremswe're going prove be true.Otherwise there's\nsome theorems thatare false for the special\ncase of the empty graph.But we don't require the\ngraph to have any edges.In fact, it's possible you\nhave a graph with nodes,but no edges.For example, this graph.Three-node graph.So here G equals VE,\nV equals x1, x2, x3.And E is just the empty set.Now for a general graph,\nwhen you do have edges,we say that two nodes,\ncall them xi and xj,are adjacent if they're\nconnected by an edge, namelyif xi xj is an edge.All right so for example,\nx5 is adjacent to x7,but it's not adjacent to\nx4, there's no edge there.Closely related is the\ndefinition of the incidence.An edge E, which\nis xixj, is saidto be incident to its\nend points, xi and xj.OK so, for example, if I\nlabeled that edge as E, E", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "is the edge x1, x2, and this\nincident to x1, and incidentx2.Then we can talk about\nthe degree of a node.The number of edges\nincident to a

edges incident to them.Now in this class, we're going\nto look at only simple graphs,at lease for a while.A graph is simple if it has\nno loops, or multiple edges.Now a loop is an edge that only\nconnects up one node, that'sa loop and we don't allow it.A multiple edge is we've got two\nedges that are really the same,", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "they connect the same

all.And Ben's over here with Nicole.And Nicole got Jude and Keith.There's actually\na website you cango to get a lot of\nthese things here.And Katie went with Josh.It's called whosedatedwho.com,\nand

million people.And the number of men nodes,\nmale nodes, call these VM,and this is VW, by the way,\nI'm using cardinality notation.When I put bars\naround a set, thatis the denoting how\nmany are in the set.In the US there's about\n147.6 men out of the 300.And the number of women--\noh we got a w here--is about 152.4 million.So there's a little\nbit more nodeson this side of the graph,\nthan that

we don't know,and we're not likely\nto figure out.I don't even think\nthese surveys, really,can estimate that.But what we're\ntrying to figure outis the ratio of the\naverage degree of the men,to the average\ndegree of the women.Because the number of\nopposite-gender partnersyou have is your\ndegree here, and you'relooking for the\naverage guy degree,compared to the average\nfemale degree

the\nUniversity of Chicagosays, they say it's 1.74.That the average guy as 74%\nmore opposite-gender partnersthan the average woman.ABC News says it's 3.33, that\nis 233% more for the men,than the

out\nthe average degree over here.Well, that's pretty simple.We just add up all the\ndegrees, and divideby the number of nodes.And that'll give us\nthe average degree.So the average degree is\nthe sum of the degrees,over all men, x\nin the set of men,of the degree of x, divided\nby the number of men.Can somebody give me a\nsimpler expression for this?", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.226}, {"text": "It

figure out a\nformula for the average numberof partners for the women.That simple that's just\nsum x over the women.The degree of x, divided\nby the number of women.Let me rewrite that\nso it's

that.That's this number,\ndivided by that number,which is about 1.0325.So we just proved,\nthat on average, a manhas 3%, or 3 and 1/4% more\nopposite-gender partnersthan women.No need to do the interviews,\nor spend years doing.That is the answer.And it has nothing to do\nwith the promiscuity of men,or women, nothing at all.So the Chicago study is way\noff, and the ABC New studyis completely nuts.It just can't be\nright, this is a proof.Now what happened here?Well what's going on, what's\nthe reason for why this is true?Yeah?AUDIENCE: A male has\na female partner thenthe female has a male partner.PROFESSOR: Yeah.AUDIENCE: You're not looking\nat like how many malesare going to one female.The promiscuity isn't even\na part of the question.PROFESSOR: That's right.It takes two to

very, very\nsimple to answer.Now as it turns out there are\nendless studies like this,in the literature.In fact, a few years\nago the Boston Globeran an explosive story about\nthe study habits of studentson Boston-area campuses.And their surveys show that,\non average, minority studentstended to study with\nnon-minority studentsmore than the other way around.And they want on great\nlength

one in probability.Any questions about\nthis before we leave?Unfortunately that's most all\nwe'll say about sex today.OK.But now, in this example,\nwe used an edge in the graphto denote some kind of\naffinity between two nodes.The two nodes liked\neach other in some senseif they were\nconnected by an edge,or they had a\nrelationship of some kind.There's lots of examples\nin computer

thinking about hereis you've got some notion\nof the order in which you'regoing to process your graph.And you're going to start\nwith a high degree nodes,in your case.And as you go\nalong, you're goingto start coloring the nodes.And you're going to make\nsure you color them legally.And it sounds like you're going\nto color them with a low coloras you go along.And that is probably the most\nbasic graph coloring approach.And almost you could almost\nsay is a generic approach.So let's define that, and then\nsee prove some facts about it.Most of the graph coloring\nalgorithms in practiceare based on this approach.And we're going to call it the\nbasic graph coloring algorithm.And for our graph G, with\nvertices V, and edges E.So the first step is going to be\nto order the nodes from 1 to n.Now in your case,\nyou were suggestingan ordering where I have\nthe high degree nodes first.All right.But for now we're not\ngoing to specify that.We're going to make it\nany

see if we dothis what happens if we\nuse this other ordering.Let me erase these.Say that's V1, V2, V3, V4, V5.Now I get C1, this\nwill be C2, C1.What's this one get?C2.Ah, much better.C3.So different orderings result\nin different numbers of colorshere.So the whole art now becomes\nfinding a clever ordering.And so many people have\nalready had good ideas,pick the largest\ndegree nodes first.And in fact, if you simulate\nthe algorithm on lots of graphs,you do better on average when\nyou color the larger degreenodes first.And then if you start to\nuse more exotic orderings,you can do even better.If you take a lot of\ngraphs that are out there,and run your algorithm,\nand see how well you do,you do better with more\nsophisticated orderings.In fact, this was my\nsenior thesis backwhen I

degree first,and recursive versions of that\nactually worked very well.And then tried it on the\nPrinceton exam graph.And lo and behold, you could\nactually squish it down,so you could give all\nthe exams, I think was,4 and 1/2 days, plenty of time\nto give them before Christmas.Which caused a fair of\nscandal at the time,because then the faculty\nhad to come cleanthat they just didn't\nwant to

75,000\nnode coloring problem,where there's edges\nbetween servers.Nodes are servers,\nand there's an edgebetween if you can't install\nnew software at the same time.And so when it\nturns out, when yourun one of these graph\ncoloring algorithms on it,you could do it\nwith eight colors.It just turns out that way.So that means there's\neight waves of installthat go on to the network.And now eight times\na few hours eachmeans that we can do it in a\nday, and you can manage it.You know on a much\nsmaller scale,the same problem exists\nfor register allocation,for variables.Here you've got to assign\nevery variable to register.But you can't have\nvariables thatare active at the\nsame time associatedwith the same register.", "start": 4680.0, "heat": 0.571}, {"text": "And you want to minimize the\nnumber of registers you need.So again, you have the\ngraph coloring problem.The number of colors is the\nnumber of registers you need.And two variables can't get\nthe same color if their activeat the same time, so you\nput an edge between them.The most famous example\nof graph coloringis the map coloring problem,\nwith the four coloring theorem.And so here, every\ncountry is a node.Adjacent countries have\nan edge between them,because you don't want to\ncolor adjacent countriesthe same color,\nor you can't tellthey're different countries.Now the last example\nwe can talk aboutis an important problem\nin communication theory,communication networks, where\nagain coloring comes up.Now here you need to assign\nfrequencies to radio stations,or the cell towers.It comes up in mobile networks,\nor just in with radio stations.And if two towers have\nan overlapping area,they can't be given\nthe same frequency,so you get collisions\nbetween the towers.And frequencies\nare very expensive.Companies pay the\ngovernment a lot of moneyto get certain spectrum.So suppose you had this problem.Here's tower A, this is A's\nrange, where it reaches.Here's tower B, so\nit overlaps somewith A. Here's tower C. Here's\ntower E. And here's tower D.All right now the\nquestion would be,how many radio\nfrequencies do you need?What's the minimum number\nof frequencies you needto enable all the towers here?We could make that be a graph.There's a node for each tower.And an edge between\ntowers, if they overlap.C doesn't overlap\nwith B, E does.E overlaps here.", "start": 4800.0, "heat": 0.262}, {"text": "And then D overlaps here.So how many frequencies do\nyou need for this graph?AUDIENCE: Four.PROFESSOR: Four would\nwork, three is better.Can you do two?No you can't do two,\nbecause you got here.But you could do three.You could do one,\ntwo, three, two, one.This problem comes up--AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]PROFESSOR: Did I screw up?Ooh, no I can't do that.One, two, yeah much better.All right, this problem\ncomes up all over the place.I'm certain you'll see it\nsometime in your career,you'll have some problem, or\nyou're scheduling something,and it's really a graph\nproblem in disguise.OK that's it for today.", "start": 4920.0, "heat": 0.244}]
