being\nvideotaped this year, and thisis the announcement that\nI have to make.So, the videotape is in the\nback, and if you want to comeup front and participate in\nthe class, you know thatyou'll be videotaped -- if you\nwant to hide your face orwhatever, you can do that but\nplease pay attention to thelectures anyway.So, this course will be\navailable on the OCW site inthe future, I'm not sure exactly\nwhat that date isgoing to be.So, today we're going to\nintroduce the chemistrytopics, which we will cover in\n5.111, and give you generalinformation, practical\ninformation about the

to say, I did not\nlike chemistry in high school,so I did not think about going\nto college to study chemistry.So, why did I not like chemistry\nin high school?I think it was because of\nimages such as this one.You spend a lot of time talking\nabout the transitionbetween alchemy and\nmodern chemistry.I wasn't very interested in\nthat kind of thing, andthere's nothing in these\nphotographs that reallyappealed to me personally.I mean, Avogadro --I'm fond of his number, and he\nis, in fact, an interesting,if not frightening looking\nman -- this just didn'tconnect with me.But then I got to

you to\nsome of the topics we aregoing to be covering in\nchemistry this semester.So, there's more detail on your\nsyllabus -- a detail ofwhat we'll cover every day,\nbut these are the kind ofbasic things that were covering,\nand you don't needto write this down, you'll\nbecome familiar with it as thesemester goes on.We start out with some really\nbasic principles.So, up here, atomic theory,\nperiodic table, bonding,structures and molecules.And there will be a little bit\nof history in there, but thisis mostly modern chemistry\nand represents the basicproperties of matter, and it's\nbasic properties of allmatter, including living matter,\nwhich was what reallyinterested me, that connection\nbetween chemistry and biology.So, then we go to thermodynamics\nand chemicalequilibrium, and this is\nreally about chemicalreactions -- weather a reaction\nwill go, will it bespontaneous, if there an\nequilibrium, what directionwill the reaction\nbe shifted in.And then, of course, not just\nwhether the reaction willoccur but, how fast it occurs\nis really important.So, that's kinetics -- how fast\na reaction will go, andfrom the perspective of someone\nwho's a biochemist,I'm interested in kinetics and\nenzyme kinetics, and thinkingabout molecules that catalyze\nreactions in the body.And then, there's acid base\nequilibrium, and alsooxidation reduction reactions,\nand what is true is that mostreactions that occur are either\ncatalyzed by eithersome kind of acid base catalysis\nor involve some kindof oxidation reduction reaction,\nand so, this sort ofrepresents a lot of the basic\nway reactions go -- now,whether that's a reaction in\nyour body or a reaction in atest tube -- it doesn't matter,\na lot of the sameprinciples are involved.And then, we also cover\ntransition metals, which issomething that you often don't\nsee in high school.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.317}, {"text": "And transition metals, those\nall medals in the middle ofyour periodic table, have some\nreally unique properties,which are exploited again in\nreactions that occur in yourbody, and also are utilized in\nindustry, for example, sowe'll talk about some of those\nunique properties.And if we put all of that\ntogether, we get the realfundamentals that you need to go\non and study -- any kind ofcurriculum that involves\nchemistry.So, these are all the\nfundamentals that are involvedin chemistry that relate to\nphysical chemistry, organicchemistry, inorganic chemistry,\nbiologicalchemistry, and are a solid\nfoundation for studying anykind of life science.So, I congratulate you of being\nhere in this class, thisis really good solid foundation\nfor whatever you goon to do, here at MIT.So, normally at this point, we\ndo actually start class with alittle bit of history from\nalchemy to modern chemistry,but I decided to skip\nthat this year.If you are interested in that,\nit's never required on anytest, it never has been, but if\nyou're interested in thatthere is an OCW lecture, which\nyou can listen to that's anexcellent lecture by Professor\nSylvia Ceyer on that.But today instead, I thought I\nwould give you some examplesof modern chemistry -- why\npeople now need to knowchemistry, what they're doing\nwith chemistry, what ischemistry research here at MIT,\nand how does it utilizethese basic principles,\nwhich we'll be talkingabout in the course.So, I'll start with\nmy colleague,Professor Joanne Stubbe.She studies molecules, in\nparticular she studiesbiological molecules.And, so one of the things she's\nvery interested in ishow this anti-cancer\ndrug, gemcitabine,works in the body.So, it inhibits an enzyme, and\nshe's interested in knowinghow that really works.So, enzymes are made up of amino\nacids, you have longchains of amino acids that form\ntogether into a proteinmolecules, protein molecules\nin your body often act asenzymes, catalyzing reactions.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.33}, {"text": "So, she is interested in how\nthis molecule, gemcitabine,inhibits an enzyme.So, to do those studies, she\nneeds to know a lot of thestuff on this list.Of course, she needs to know\nthe basic principles, butshe's also talking about it an\nenzyme, so she needs to knowabout enzyme catalysis.She needs to know this enzyme\nworks by both acid basechemistry, and oxidation\nreduction.It has two irons that are\ninvolved in doing thechemistry, so it includes\ntransition metals.She thinks about how things\nbind, how the naturalreactants binds, how the\ninhibitor binds, and so sheneeds to know what happens to\nthe chemical equilibrium, sheneeds to know about the\nthermodynamics of thosebinding events, and, of course,\neverything, all thebasic principles, are\nrequired here.So, to do this biochemistry\nresearch, she needs to knowall of these things, and she\nhas really made tremendousprogress in understanding how\ngemcitabine works, and it isnot so toxic, so it's a really\ngood thing to have inchemotherapy.So, in addition to studying\nmolecules, chemists often wantto make molecules, such\nas Tim Jamison,who's an organic chemist.So, you will hear, probably,\nhopefully, in thispresidential debate about the\nenvironment and about whysaving the environment\nis important.And one of the things you\noften hear about in thisdiscussion is about our oceans\nand about rainforests, andpart of the reason why people\nwant to protect those areas isbecause you find a\nlot of naturalproducts in those regions.So, a natural product is\nsomething that is made bynature, and often natural\nproducts, whether it comesfrom a plant or a marine\norganism have some reallygood, useful properties.And so, one particular compound\nhas anti-tumorproperties.So, again, along this line\nof cancer research.So, Tim Jamison's lab figured\nout how to make this thing.And often that's really\nimportant, because you can'tget enough of the organism that\nnaturally makes it, to beable to grind that organism up\nand have enough that you can", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.432}, {"text": "actually use as a medicine.So, you have to make more of\nit, because nature doesn'tmake enough.So, it's very important to\nfigure out how to do that.So, in doing that, Tim Jamison's\nlab needs a lot ofthese things.So, he needs a lot of knowledge\nof bonding, he wantsto form bonds in making this.He needs to know about the\nstructures of the molecules,because if the structure is\nwrong it's not going to work.And often, if you want to make a\nlot of it, you have to thinkabout the thermodynamics of\nthe system, how fast thereactions will go and kinetics,\nand then whetherthey'll go, the thermodynamics,\nand sometimesthen you need to adjust the\nreactions, maybe use atransition metal to\nmake it go better.So, these are all the things\nthat Tim Jamison needs to knowto do organic chemistry.So, you'll be learning in this\nclass a great preparation for512, which is organic\nchemistry.In addition to studying\nmolecules and makingmolecules, some chemists want\nto detect molecules, and achemist who likes to detect\nmolecules is Tim Swager.So, Tim Swager's lab has\ndesigned sensors that detectvapors, and so they will detect\nTNT, for example.And so, he has put this\nchemistry to use in thisrobotic arm and they call it\nFido, because often dogs arethe creatures that have to go\nout and detect these things,and it's not a great job if\nyou're a dog to be sent out tosee whether there was an\nexplosive and discover yes,there was, a little\nbit too late.So, this is a much nicer way to\ndetect chemicals with thisrobotic arm, and here's a\npicture of it in use in Iraq.So, in doing this, if you go\ndown to kind of a basicprinciples that Tim needed\nto know about, oxidationreduction was really key in\ndeveloping this technology, sowe'll talk about that.So, my final example is from\nAlan Davidson's lab, and Alanis an inorganic chemist -- he\nloved those transition metals", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.459}, {"text": "and they're unique properties,\nand he designed this compound,it's called Cardiolite, and it's\nused in heart imaging.So, many people have relatives\nthey know of that have had tohave their heart imaged --\nheart disease is a majorproblem in the United States,\nand there's a good chance thatthey had Cardiolite given\nto them to help inthat imaging process.So, this again, takes advantage\nof those greatunique properties of transition\nmetals, which we'lltalk about in this course.So, again, all together, this\nis the basis for modernchemistry, and examples I just\ngave you, are some of thethings that modern chemists are\nworking on -- some of theissues that our country faces\nand our world faces, and howchemistry is involved in that.So, not only will you have the\nfundamental knowledge to go onand take more courses in\nchemistry, you will also havethe fundamental knowledge to\ngo on and do undergraduateresearch here, and here\nare some of the 5.111undergraduate researchers that\nhave come through my lab, inparticular, from this class.So, it's a really nice\nsolid foundation.So, I want to encourage you to\nset some of your likes anddislikes from high school aside\nwhen you come to MIT,because at MIT you often see\ndisciplines taught andemphasize a very different\nfashion thanwhat you've seen before.And you may discover that the\nthing you came here to studyis not the thing that\nyou really wantto study after all.One other thing that I'll say\nto you is that I said thesewords at one point, it's true,\nI said, when I was in highschool, I said, \"I hate\nchemistry.\" And now, I dochemistry every day and will\nfor the rest my life.I love chemistry now.Be very careful what you say.Have any of you made\nthat statement",

openmind, explore new areas -- take\nadvantage of being atthis amazing place for science\nand technology and you maysurprise yourself in what you\nreally enjoy learning about.So, that's a little bit about\nthe chemistry that we're goingto cover in this class, and now\nI'm going to talk a littlebit about some of the policies\nand procedures.But first I need to introduce\nmy co-instructor for thisclass, and let me just put\nup her picture, you'llsee her in a minute.So, Dr. Beth Vogel Taylor.So, all chemistry courses are\nteam taught, so you have adifferent lecturer for the first\nhalf than the secondhalf, and Dr. Taylor will be\ndoing most of the first halflectures, and I'll\nbe doing most ofthe second half lectures.So, Dr. Taylor will take you\nfrom atomic theory throughthermodynamics, and I'll start\nup with chemical equilibrium,talk to about kinetics, acid\nbase, oxidation reduction andtransition metals.So, you will have both of us\nas lecturers in this class.Now, in the past, sometimes\nstudents have found this wholething a little frustrating, that\nthey just get used to onelecture style, and then all of\na sudden there's anotherlecture style, and\nthat can be true.I mean sometimes the styles of\nthe two professors couldn't bemore different -- think\nMcCain/Palin, odd couples.Sometimes they're more similar,\nand when I first,about a year and a half ago,\ngot to know Dr. Taylor, wesort of realized that we had\nvery similar styles, and wegot very excited about the\nidea that we could teachtogether, so that there would\nbe much more continuitythroughout the semester.And so, Dr. Taylor had been\nteaching the first half of thematerial in the Spring, and I\nhad been teaching the secondhalf of the material in the\nFall, and we thought wouldn't", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.366}, {"text": "it be great if we got together\nand taught in the Fall.So, this was actually, for a\nvariety of reasons, a verycomplicated thing to request\nand do, and so we started acampaign and campaigned for a\nyear and a half that we shouldbe allowed to do this course\ntogether, and finally just afew weeks ago in August -- we\nreally didn't know up untilalmost when this course\nstarted -- thatpermission was granted.So, I have to say, I am very\nexcited now to introduce youto Dr. Taylor, who I would be\nteaching with this semester --limited engagement -- who will\ntell you about some of thecourse policies.PROFESSOR: Okay, so before we\nget to some of these coursepolicies, I think I'll tell you\na little bit about my pathto chemistry as well.Professor Drennan explained that\nnot everyone that ends upas a chemist started off that\nway on their first classfreshman year, for example,\nin chemistry.And in fact, if you talk to a\nlot of chemists, if you talkto some of the graduate\nstudents, maybe your TA,you'll find that that phrase, \"I\nhate chemistry,\" has maybebeen uttered by more than one us\nat some point in our livesbefore we realized, and once it\nhappens you don't go back,that actually you love chemistry\nand it's hard toeven remember a point where you\ndidn't see all of theseconnections that it\nprovided for you.To give a little background of\nwhere I was, sitting wheremaybe you are today on the first\nday of chemistry, when Ileft high school, I had no\ninterest in chemistrywhatsoever.And I have only one strong\nmemory from high schoolchemistry, and that memory is\nshown right here, and that isthe common ions.Did you guys have to learn\nthe common ions?Does anyone have that in their\nbrain somewhere for ready use?I don't, in fact, so it's\nactually okay if you don'tknow all your common ions,\nif you missed that part.This is the strongest memory I\nhave, and I remembered a) that", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.355}, {"text": "I didn't learn them, and that\nwas really bad because it keptcoming up, but the other thing\nI remember is that I had noidea why they were important.I didn't really understand\nwhat any ofthese molecules were.I certainly didn't understand\nhow they even connected reallyto chemical reactions, much less\nother disciplines that Iwas interested in.I couldn't have told you, for\nexample, if we look at aphosphate group, that that's\ngoing to be incrediblyimportant in DNA, that it's also\nan incredibly importantgroup when you're dealing with\nproteins and whether you'returning the function of\na protein on or off.So really, I just had no context\nfor the chemistry.So, when I started in college,\nthat wasn't even an option forme and I was interested\nin a lot of things,chemistry not being one.But one that I was very\ninterested in was biology, andthe reason was we did a lot of\ncool labs in high school, Iloved doing the dissections --\nit was very interesting to meto think about how different\norgans worked, how the heartcould be a pump, how\nthe lungs worked.And then when we got to more\nof a cellular level, it waseven more interesting to see\nthat we could actuallyunderstand how our body worked\nas low of a level as thinkingabout cells.And so, that was a clear\nmajor for me to pick --I actually also was considering\nEnglish and endedup being a minor in English.But, I think what most of you,\nactually having come to MIT,have probably realized is\nsometimes it's nice to majorin a science, because you can't\njust pick up a reactionand do it in your kitchen on the\nweekend, where as you cansometimes join a book\ngroup and do that.So, it's kind of nice to major\nin the thing that you're goingto get to have the opportunity\nto do for therest of your life.So, I actually also\nstarted pre-med.Is anyone else pre-med here?Okay, so a pretty\ngood showing.So maybe you can relate to some\nof the reasons I wantedto be pretty pre-med -- part of\nit was the interest in thescience and the biology.Also, I wanted to help people\n-- it seemed like a reallyclear way that I could have a\ncareer that was challengingand involved in science, but\nalso helping others.So, it seemed like a good start\nfor me, pre-med/bio, andI signed up for my\nbio class --I found out, as Professor\nDrennan did, that I had to", "start": 1200.0, "heat": 0.403}, {"text": "take chemistry as well.I wasn't as upset, I was sort of\na neutral chemistry personat this point, but I thought it\nwas pretty smart to get itover with on the first\nsemester, sothat's what I did.And my plan was going along fine\nuntil something happened,and what happened was that\nchemistry was just way moreinteresting than\nI anticipated.So, my perfect pre-med/bio\nplan was getting a littleshaken right from the start,\nand the reason that it wasgetting taken was because I\nwould learn this new principalin chemistry and because I was\ntaking bio with the same time,I could see the connections.And at one point I realized,\n\"Oh, my gosh, chemistry isjust biology, it's just looking\nat one level deeper.\"So actually, all of my interest\nin biology wasquickly transferred to saying,\n\"Wow, now I can think aboutthings on the molecular\nlevel.\" And one of themolecules that caught my\nattention first, and I can'tremember if this was freshman\nor sophomore year in highschool, was the first time I\nactually took meaning inlooking at a chemical structure,\nand that was withthe structure of penicillin\nhere, and I know that all ofyou are familiar with\npenicillin, whether or not youknow the structure or not, but\nthe most important part ofthis structure is the\nfour-membered ring here, thebeta-lactam, and this was the\nfirst time I thought I couldactually understand how a\nmolecule worked because I knewsomething about chemistry.So, for example with penicillin\nwhat it does is itinhibits an enzyme that builds\nthe cell wall in bacteria, thebacterial cell wall, and if I\nthought about what I'd learnedin chemistry -- some of you know\nthis from high school,some of you will be very\nfamiliar with this soon, isthat this carbon here,\nfor example, isbonded to three things.Does anyone know what angle\nthose would like to be at?120.They want to get as far away\nfrom each other possible, theideal angle is 120.But what we have here is a\nfour-membered ring, so whatangle does that have\nto be, that bond?90 degrees.So, we have a problem here if\nwe're thinking about keepingthings at the lowest energy,\nso there's a lot of ring", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.475}, {"text": "strain in the system.And I was incredibly excited\nthat I could look at that andrealize it and say \"Wow, that's\nwhy it's so reactive,that's why it's such a good\nmedication,\" because when itcomes into contact with these\nbacterial cell wall buildingenzyme, the enzyme can actually\nreact with thisfour-membered ring and\nopen up the ring andrelieve that ring strain.So, now the angles can open up\nall the way to 120 if it wantsto, and there's no way it's\ngoing to form that ring again,right, because it's not going\nto back to those 90 degreeangles, if it can help it.So now, the enzyme is locked\nup with the penicillinmolecule, no more bacterial cell\nwall being built, and thepenicillin has effectively\nkilled the bacteria.So, that, for me, was kind of\nthe first connection that whatwent, \"Woah, wait a second, I\nwant to be thinking aboutthese molecules all the way\ndown to the level ofindividual atoms.\" So, at this\npoint, kept the pre-med, justswitched the major\nto chemistry.The next problem came\nup when I went andtook organic chemistry.So, if you're dead set on\nstaying with bio, maybe, Iguess you have to take organic,\nso this might happento you, just to warn you.We started looking at all\nsorts of other kinds ofmolecules that became very\ninteresting to me.I especially love thinking\nabout vitamins and drugs,because I do have\nthat interest inmedicine and human health.These are actually all examples\nthat we'll talk aboutin freshman chemistry at some\npoint, as an example of aconnection between a chemical\nprinciple we learn, and whatwe can know about how\nit functions.But what happened here was I\nthought \"Oh, my gosh, now Icould actually, using my\nchemical knowledge, thinkabout synthesizing these\nmolecules, or maybe coming upwith new ways to synthesize\nthem better or synthesizedifferent molecules.And the real clincher was when\nI started doing someundergraduate research.Any potential UROPs out there\n--

I thought, \"You know what,\nI think I'll change themedical school plans and now I'm\ngoing to go all the way --chemistry major, chemistry grad\nschool.\" And the reason Iwas able to do that and keep\nwith what my originalintentions were was to have\na career that was thefulfilling, in terms of helping\npeople and beingengaged in science, is all of\na sudden I realized, aschemists, we can
