now.We'll figure it out later.I like to ask people\nto explain, nowthat they know what\nthe right answer is,if someone will explain why\nthat is the right answer.And I know it's a big\nclass, and people sometimesget nervous about talking.So I bribe people.So today, the person who\nanswers why that is correctwill get an MIT\nchemistry T-shirt.OK.AUDIENCE: All right, let's see.If you're using 5\nmoles of N2, youneed 15 moles of hydrogen gas.Since there's not\nenough hydrogen gas--there's only 10 moles-- that\nmeans the hydrogen gas shouldbe the limiting reactant since\nyou would need roughly 3.33moles of N2 for it.CATHERINE DRENNAN: Great.And here is an MIT\nchemistry T-shirt.[APPLAUSE]CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK, so you'll\nnotice that the prizes aregood in the beginning, get\nworse throughout the semester,and get good again at the end.So keep that in mind.OK, so let's try to get started.It's been a little\nbit of a crazy start.If people are still\nhaving clicker problems,we have

talking about the\ndiscovery of the electronand of the nucleus.And I said that there's\ngoing to be limited amounts--or every time I have a\nlecture that has some history,I'm going to counter that\nwith some modern chemistry.So next week,\nwe're going to havetwo examples of modern uses.But today, we're going\nto do a little history.And I like history,\nespecially whenit can lead to a cool demo.So you might have noticed\nsomething demo-like came inwhile we were\ndoing the clickers.So that's always good.And I also like\ntalking about historywhen I feel like it's a\ngreat example of a challengethat chemists face, and\nreally, most scientistsface, that they used to face\nand still currently face,which is that chemists\nstudy small particles.They study things\nthat are really tiny.How do you study something\nthat's really small?How do you demonstrate\nthat somethingthat is invisible to\nthe eye actually exists?So this is a common challenge.And so today, I'm\ngoing to tell youabout how the electron\nand the nucleuswere discovered at\na very low-tech timein our scientific\nhistory, how theywere able to figure this out.And let me just set the stage\nof what people were thinkingaround this time, and how\nthese discoveries reallychanged everything.So in the late 1890s, chemists\nwere patting each otheron the back.And physicists too were\nthinking, boy, we have itall figured out.We have a real, complete\nunderstanding of our universe.We have atomic theory of matter.We have Newtonian mechanics.This is really great.And in fact, someone\nsaid these words,which are really\ndangerous words,that our future\ndiscoveries must be lookedfor in the sixth decimal place.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.861}, {"text": "So honestly, when I\nstarted studying chemistry,I thought everything\nabout chemistrywas probably already known.And it was just\nfine tuning things.I was absolutely\nwrong at that time.And this statement\nwas absolutely wrong,and it really came right\nbefore the major discoveryof the electron, where they\nrealized they hadn't reallyunderstood anything about\nthe atomic theory of matter.So more experiments are\nalways dangerous because theycan change everything.And that's why I\nreally like science.All right, so the experiment\nI'm going to tell you today,JJ Thompson's discovery\nof the electron.Or one of the experiments\nI'll tell you about today,and this is really a\npretty simple experiment.So JJ Thompson was interested in\nthis thing called cathode rays.He had hydrogen gas, and then\nhe took an evacuated glasscylinder.And he put hydrogen gas in it.And then he applied\na current to that,and he could see\nthese rays coming off.And he thought that\nwas pretty cool.And so he was wondering\nabout these rays.Are they made up of\nnegatively charged particles,possibly charged\nparticles, maybe neutral?What are these things?So he decided to\ndo this experiment.And he wondered whether\nif he took two platesand had charges associated\nwith them, whether hewould see the cathode\nrays deflected or not.Well, first, he didn't\napply any current,so it was just neutral, just to\nsee if putting these plates inwould affect\nanything in any way.And so when he did\nthat, when therewas zero voltage difference\nbetween these two plates,he could see the cathode ray\nhit this phosphor screen.And there was no deflection.All right, then he\nsaid, OK, now, I'mgoing to charge things up, and\nsee if I can see a deflection.So he did that, and\nhe saw the following.There was a deflection.And so now, the different\nvoltage between the plateswas greater than 0.And now, he saw\nthe cathode ray was", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.843}, {"text": "being deflected a different\ndistance of delta x over here.And it was being deflected\ntoward the positive plate.So that said to him that\nthe cathode ray containednegatively charged particles.You'll notice that the word\n\"negatively\" is the only wordon the screen in blue.And if you look at\nyour notes, you'llsee that there's a blank spot.Just pointing out there\nmight be a correlation there.OK, so he knew some things\nalso from classical workthat was done in the time.And I didn't reset my boards.So he knew something\nabout what it meantif there was just deflection.So we had our deflection of the\nnegatively charged particles.And he knew that\nthat was going to beproportional to the\ncharge of the negativelycharged particle.And it was going to be\ndirectly proportional to that,and inversely proportional\nto the mass of the negativelycharged particle.So it was a pretty big\ndeflection, so he wasn't sure.Maybe there was a\nvery big charge,or maybe there was a very\nsmall mass, or maybe both.So then he wanted to see\nwhat happened if he reallygot things going,\nand he applied evenmore of voltage difference.So he did that.And when he did\nthat, he saw this.He saw another deflection, but\nthis time, it was much smaller.And it was toward the\nnegatively charged plate.So he realized that, in addition\nto the negatively chargedparticle, there was also a\npositively charged particle.So for that particle,\nthen, the deflection",

positively\ncharged particle.But there was a big\ndifference in this deflection.Toward the positive plate,\nthere was a big deflection.And toward the negative\nplate, it was pretty small.So he knew that this deflection\nwas much bigger than that one.And then he thought\nabout-- is that goingto be due to charge or mass?But he said, the charges\nshould be the samebecause it's neutral normally.So those charges must equal\neach other, the absolute valuesat least, must equal each other.So then we can think\nabout the comparisonof these deflections.So if we can take the absolute\nvalue of the deflectionof the negatively\ncharged particleover the absolute value of the\ndeflection of the positivelycharged particle,\non the top here,we're going to have the\ncharge of the negativelycharged particle over the\nmass of the negativelycharged particle.And the absolute\nvalue of that termover the charge\nof the positivelycharged particle, over the\nmass of the positively chargedparticle.But now, if you say\nthat the charges areequal to each other, at least\nthe absolute values of them,we can get rid of that term.And just see that the mass\nthen, of the positively chargedparticle over the negatively\ncharged particle, remains.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.543}, {"text": "So if this is going to be\nbig, and we know it is,it's a big difference.The negatively charged\nparticle deflecteda lot more than the\npositively charged particle.That means that the difference\nin masses also has to be big,and that that negatively charged\nparticle must be a lot smallerin mass than the positively\ncharged particle.So if we go up a\nlittle bit here-- oops.So the mass of the\nnegatively charged particlemust be a lot smaller than the\nmass of the positively chargedparticle.And actually, it's about\n2,000 times smaller.So he was able to\nfigure all this outby just doing this\npretty simple experiment.So he had now a small,\nnegatively charged particle,and also a positively\ncharged particle.And later, the negatively\ncharged particle got a name.The negatively charged particle\ngot the name of the electron.And its mass was determined\nin an another interestingexperiment I won't\ntell you about.And it was determined to be\nreally small, about 9 times 10to the minus 31 kilograms.So through this\nexperiment, he wasable to figure out, that\nin these cathode rays,you had something that\nwas tiny, this electron.And that means this idea that\natoms were the smallest thingout there was incorrect.That's what everyone believed.They were patting\nthemselves on the back.They had figured it all out.But there was something\nsmaller than the atom.There was this electron,\nthis negativelycharged particle\nthat was really tiny.So it is pretty cool.It's a pretty\nlow-tech experimentthat figured out something that\nreally changed the way that wethought about science.So what about the nucleus?So we had the\nelectron, and we alsohad

Rutherford is credited with\nthe discovery of the nucleus.So this was a little later.And he had been studying\nradioactive material.And his good friend,\nMarie Curie, from Francewould often send him interesting\nsamples for him to study.I'm not sure quite how they\ngot from France to England.Some of these were really\ncancer causing things.I don't know how many people\ntouched them without safetyprecautions on the way.But anyway, it's interesting to\nnote that Rutherford actuallydid not die of cancer,\ndespite this research.He was literally the\nvictim of his own success.So after his great\ndiscovery of the nucleus,which I'll tell you about,\nhe was made into a knight.And at one point,\nhe became sick.And he needed a doctor.Well, if you're a\nknight in England,you can't just have any\nold doctor treat you.You need to have a doctor\nthat is also a knight.And so while he was\nwaiting for a doctorof the appropriate ranking to\ncome and treat him, he died.So he literally died\nof his own success.He was a victim of\nhis own success.But it wasn't just his success\nas I'll tell you about.He had some help.He had a really good\ngraduate student,a really good undergraduate\nstudent helping him out.So he was studying\nthese alpha particlesthat were being emitted from\nthis radioactive material.And we know now that this\nis Helium plus 2 ions.But that was not\nknown at the time.They just knew\nsomething was coming outof this radioactive\nmaterial, and theywanted to find out what\nit was, and characterizethe properties of this.So he had a post-doc\nnamed Hans Geiger.And this is the Geiger\nof the Geiger counter.And he also had an undergraduate\nstudent, E. Marsden.And so together, they did\nthe following experiment.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.121}, {"text": "And I wasn't obviously there,\nbut I'm imagining that by \"theydid the following\nexperiment,\" itmeant the undergraduate\nand the graduate student,or maybe even just\nthe undergraduate.OK, so here is the experiment.They had the\nradioactive material.Alpha particles were\ncoming off, and theyhad built a detector that would\ncount how many alpha particleswere coming off.And so they did the\nexperiment, and they counted.And they found there\nwere a lot of particles,132,000 alpha particles\nper minute, in fact.So then they said,\nOK, let's see whathappens if we put\na piece of foilin the path of the\nalpha particles.And we're going to have\nreally, really thin gold foil.So this is like smaller\nthan a human hair.This is really,\nreally thin foil.And they shot alpha\nparticles at it.And they counted.And they got\napproximately-- I don'tknow how many significant\nfigures-- but 132,000 alphaparticles.Seemed to be, in terms of the\nsignificant figures, the same.So it was just going through.These alpha particles\nwere just goingthrough this thin, gold foil.So they had this vision\nthen of the gold atomsbeing all empty space, and\nthe alpha particles were justgoing through, no problem.But then they did\none more experiment.And by then, I think this\nwas the undergraduate.So they built this detector.And they had built the\ndetector so it could move.So sometimes when you design\nsomething to do something,you actually want\nto use it for that.So if we have the alpha\nparticles coming this wayand on the detector over here.And it had been sitting,\nand I've been collecting it.The undergraduate\nwas told, well,", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.108}, {"text": "put the detector over\nthere, and see what happens.So the undergraduate moved\nthe detector over here.And he said, you're going to\nsee if the alpha particles hitthe gold foil and backscatter.So we'll have the\ndetector over here.So the undergraduate did this.They didn't think it was\ngoing to do anything.They needed something for\nthe undergraduate to do.So they had him do that.And then they counted.And sure enough, click, click.It wasn't a lot,\nbut there seemedto be some backscatter,\nabout 20 counts,20 alpha particles per minute.That was not expected.They were expecting 0.So they were detecting\nbackscattering.The alpha particles\nwere bouncing offthat thin, gold foil, and coming\nback at the moved detector.So they could calculate this\nprobability of backscattering,the account rate of\nthe backscatteringover the normal count\nof the particles.And so they had 20\nbackscattering events,or 20 counts over the 132,000,\n2 times 10 to the minus 4,or 0.02%.This is small, very small.But it was not 0.And I don't know how many\ntimes they did this experiment,but I can imagine\nthere were lotsof times they did the experiment\nthat no one would reallybelieve this result.And Rutherford himself said,\n\"it was about as credibleas if you had fired\na 15-inch shellat a piece of tissue paper,\nand it came back and hit you.\"So that's how he felt about it.He was like, I don't\nunderstand how this is working.This is so thin.It's like tissue paper, but\nyet these alpha particlesare bouncing off something.", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.165}, {"text": "So what did this all mean,\nonce they had repeatedthe experiment many times?So their interpretation, then,\nwas that these gold atomswere, in fact, mostly empty.It seemed like all the\nalpha particles were justgoing through.Most of them were just\npassing through and nothitting anything.But there was something in\nthere that could be hit.There was some concentrated\nmass in this volumethat, when the alpha particle\nhit that directly, itbackscattered.And they later called\nthis the nucleus.So they came up then with\nthis new model, the Rutherfordmodel, where you had\nmostly empty space.But you had\nconcentrated mass insidethat an alpha particle might\nhit and then backscatter.And Rutherford assumed\nthat the electrons wouldbe in that empty space, and\nthat this positive mass wasgoing to be positively charged.Because he knew the overall\natom was going to be neutral.So just a little nomenclature.We can think about the charge\nof the electrons in the atomas being equal to\nminus Z to the e, whereZ is our atomic number,\nand e is the absolute valueof the electron's charge.And if this term is negative,\nthen the charge on the nucleusis going to be positive.So we have positive Z to the\ne, because overall, the atomis going to be neutral.Then Rutherford went\non to actually usethis backscattering to measure\nthe diameter of this positivelycharged, dense part of\nthe atom, of the nucleus.And he was able to\nmeasure that diameteras a very small number, 10\nto the minus 14th meters.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.298}, {"text": "So he did this with this\nback scattering

attractive, like\nmost chemists, except Avogadro.He's very strange looking.OK, so if these things are\ngoing to be close to each other,then they should be\nattracted to each otherand collapse into
