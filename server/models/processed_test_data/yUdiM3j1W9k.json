[{"text": " today for those of you do not know me my name is dr. Carter and in this topic we room to discuss phasers so basically we're going to be looking at the sum of sinusoidal functions all of which have the same frequency we're going to see that the trigonometry involved with this is quite complex and then we will see that we can simplify this operation by transforming two complex numbers or phasers and therefore we will have a phase of representation of these sinusoids we will then convert this trigonometric addition into phasor or complex number addition we will see why this phase of representation works will then carry on and look at phase and multiplication phasor inverses which we will then use and apply to linear circuits with alternating current so let's consider an arbitrary sinusoid it will have some period t the frequency is 1 over the period and the angular frequency is 2 pi times the frequency the angular frequency being in radians it's always possible to write such a sinusoid in terms of new codes of Omega

cosine of 377 t minus 90 degrees now a positive phase shift means that a function is leading in time so for example negative sine is cosine of T plus 90 degrees now if we're looking at if as time advances we notice that negative sine Peaks before the cosine function so therefore the sine function is lag is leading the cosine function in time the same thing happens if we look at coast of 377 T
