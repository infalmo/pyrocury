thesesinusoids we will then convert thistrigonometric addition into phasor orcomplex number addition we will see whythis phase of representation works willthen carry on and look at phase andmultiplication phasor inverses which wewill then use and apply to linearcircuits with alternating current solet's consider an arbitrary sinusoid itwill have some period t the frequency is1 over the
