[{"text": "PROFESSOR: Hi, I'm Gilbert\nStrang, and this is the veryfirst in a series of videos\nabout highlights of calculus.I'm doing these just because\nI hope they'll be helpful.It seems to me so easy to be\nlost in the big calculustextbooks and the many, many\nproblems and in the details.But do you see the\nbig picture?Well, I hope this will help.For me, calculus is about therelation between two functions.And one example for those two\nfunctions, one good example,is function 1, the distance,\ndistance traveled, what yousee on a trip meter in a car.And function 2, the one that\ngoes with distance, is speed,how quickly you're going, how\nfast you're traveling.So that's one pair\nof functions.Let me give another pair.I could get more and more, but\nI think if we get these twopairs, we can move forward.So in this second pair,\nheight is function 1,how high you've climbed.If it's a graph, how far the\ngraph goes above the axis.", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.55}, {"text": "Up, in other words.So that's height, and then\nthe other one tells youhow fast you climb.The height tells how\nfar you climbed.It could be a mountain.And then the slope tells you how\nquickly you're climbing ateach point.Are you going nearly\nstraight up?Flat?Possibly down?So distance and speed, height\nand slope will serve as goodexamples to start with.And let me give you some\nletters, some algebra lettersthat you might use.Distance, maybe I would\ncall that f of t.So f for how far or for\nfunction, and the idea is thatt is the input.It's the time when you're\nasking for the distance.The output is the distance.Or in the case of height,\nmaybe y of x wouldbe the right one.x is how far you go across.That's the input.And at each x, you have an\noutput y how far up?So f is telling you how far.y is telling you the\nheight of a graph.That's function 1, two examples\nof function 1.Now, what about slope?Well, luckily, speed and slope\nstart with the same letter, soI'll often use s for the speed\nor the slope for this second--oh, it even stands for\na second function.But let me tell you\nalso the right--", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.369}, {"text": "the official--letters that make the connection\nbetween function 2and function 1.If my function is a function of\ntime, the distance, how farI go, then the speed is--the right letters are df dt.Everybody uses those letters.So let me say again how\nto pronounce: df dt.And Leibniz came up with\nthat notation, andhe just got it right.And what would this one be?Well, corresponding to this, it\nlooks the same, or dy dx.Again, I'll just repeat how\nto say that: dy dx.And that is the slope, and we\nhave to understand what thosesymbols mean.Right now, I'm just writing\nthem down as symbols.May I begin with the most\nimportant and the simplestexample of all?Let me take that case.OK, so the key example here,\nthe one to get completelystraight is the case\nof constantspeed, constant slope.I'll just graph that.So here I'm go to graph.Shall I make it the speed?Yeah, let's say speed.So time is going\nalong that way.Speed is up this way.And I'm going to say in this\nfirst example that the speedis the same.We're traveling at the\nconstant speed", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.267}, {"text": "of let's say 40.So it stays at the\nheight of 40.Oh, properly, I should add units\nlike miles per hour orkilometers per hour or meters\nper second or whatever.For now, I'll just write 40.OK, now if we're traveling at a\nspeed of 40 miles per hour,what's the distance?Well, let me start with the\ntrip meter at zero.so this is time again,\nand now this isgoing to be the distance.After one hour, my\ndistance is 40.So if I mark t equal to\n1, I've reached 40.That's height of 40.At t equal to 2, I've\nreached 80.At t equal to 1/2, half an\nhour, I've reached 20.Those points lie on a line.The graph of distance covered\nwhen you're just traveling ata steady rate, constant rate,\nconstant speed is just astraight line.And now I can make\nthe connection.I've been speaking here about\ndistance and speed.But now let me think of\nthis as the height--40 is that height.80 is that height--and ask about slope.What is slope?So let's just remember what's\nthe connection here.What's the slope if that's the\ndistance if I look at my tripmeter and I know I'm traveling\nalong at that constant speed,", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.315}, {"text": "how do I find that speed?Well, slope, it's the distance\nup, which would be 40 afterone hour, divided\nby the distanceacross, 40/1, or 80/2.Doesn't matter, because we're\ntraveling at constant speed,so the slope, which is up,\nover, across is 40/1,80/2, 20 over 1/2.I'll put 80/2 as one\nexample: 40.Oh, let me do it--that's arithmetic.Let me do it with algebra.We don't need calculus\nyet, by the way.Calculus is coming\npretty quickly.This is the step we can take.Because the speed is constant,\nwe can just divide thedistance by the time to find--and this slope, let me\nright speed also.Up, over, across, distance\nover time, f/t,that gives us s.This is s.OK, what about--calculus goes both ways.We can go both ways here.We already have practically.Here I went in the direction\nfrom 1 to 2.Now, I want to go in\nthe direction--suppose I know the speed.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.253}, {"text": "How do I recover the distance?If I know my speed is 40 and I\nknow I started at zero, what'smy distance?Distance or height,\neither one.So these are like both.Now, I'm just going\nthe other way.Well, you see how.How do I find f?It's s times t, right?Your algebra automatically says\nif you see a t there, youcan put it there.So it's s times t.It's a straight line.s times t, s times\nx, y equal sx.Let me put another--the same idea with\nmy y, x letters.It's that line.In other words, if that one\nis constant, this one is astraight line.OK, straightforward, but\nvery, very fundamental.In fact, can I call your\nattention to something alittle more?Suppose I measured between\ntime 2 and time 1.So I'm looking between time 2\nand time 1, and I look how farI went in that time.But what I'm trying is--I'm going to put in another\nlittle symbol because it'sgoing to be really\nworth knowing.It's really the change in f\ndivided by the change in t.I use that letter delta\nto indicatea difference between--", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.23}, {"text": "the difference between time 2\nand time 1 was 1, and thedifference between height\n2 and height 1 was 40.You see, I'm looking at\nthis little piece.And, of course, the\nslope is still 40.It's still the slope\nof that line.Yeah, so that really what I'm\nmeasuring in speed there, Idon't always have to be starting\nat t equals 0, and Idon't always have to be starting\nat f equals 0.Oh, let me draw that.Suppose I started\nat f equals 40.My trip meter happened\nto start at 40.After an hour, I'd\nbe up to 80.After another hour,\nI'd be up to 120.Do you see that this starting\nthe trip meter, who careswhere the trip meter started?It's the change in the trip\nmeter that tells howlong the trip was.Clear.OK, so that's that example.We come back to it because it's\nthe basic one where thespeed is constant.And even if now I have to move\nto a changing speed, you haveto let me bring calculus\ninto these lectures.OK, I'm going to draw another\npicture, and youtell me about the--yeah, let me draw function 1,\nanother example of function 1.So again I have time.I have distance.I'm going to start at zero, but\nI'm not going to keep thespeed constant.I'm going to start out at\na good speed, but I'mgoing to slow down.Do you see me slowing\ndown there?I don't mean slowing down\nwith the chalk.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.249}, {"text": "I mean slowing down\nwith slope.The slope started out steep.By here, by that point,\nthe slope was zero.What was the car doing here?The car is certainly moving\nforward because the distanceis increasing.Here it's increasing faster.Here it's increasing barely.In other words, we're putting\non the brakes.The car is slowing down.We're coming to a red light.In fact, there is the red light\nright at that time.Now, just stay with it to think\nwhat would the speedlook like for this problem?If that's a picture of\nthe function, justlet's get some idea.I'm not going to have\na formula yet.I'm not putting in\nall the details.Well, actually, I don't plan to\nput in all the details ofcalculus of every possible\nstep we might take.It's the important ones I'm\nhoping to show you and I'mhoping for you to see that\nthey are important.OK, what is important?Roughly, what does the\ngraph looks like?Well, the speed--the slope--started out somewhere\nup there.Yeah, it started out at a good\nspeed and slowed down.And by this point, ha!Let's mark that time\nhere on that graph.Do you see what is the\nspeed at that moment?The speed at that\nmoment is zero.", "start": 840.0, "heat": 0.32}, {"text": "The car has stopped.The speed is decreasing.Let me make it decrease,\ndecrease, decrease, decrease,and at that moment, the speed\nis zero right there.That's that point.See, two different pictures,\ntwo different functions.but same information.So calculus has the job of given\none of those functions,find the other one.Given this function,\nfind that one.This way is called--from function one to function\ntwo, that's calleddifferential calculus.Big, impressive word anyway.That's function one to two,\nfinding the speed.Going the other direction is\ncalled integral calculus.The step is called integration\nwhen you take the speed overthat period of time, and you\nrecover the distance.So it's differential calculus\nin one direction, integralcalculus in the other.Now, here's a question.Let me continue that curve\na little longer.I got it to the red light.Now imagine that the distance\nstarts goingdown from that point.What's happening?The distance is decreasing.The car is going backwards.It's going in reverse.The speed, what's the speed?Negative.The speed, because distance is\ngoing from higher to lower,", "start": 960.0, "heat": 0.405}, {"text": "that counts for negative\nspeed.The speed curve would\nbe going down here.Do you see that that's a not\nbrilliantly drawn picture, butyou're seeing the--that's the farthest it went.Then the car started backwards,\nand the speed curvereflected that by going\nbelow zero.You see, two different curves,\nbut same information.I'm remembering an old movie.I don't know if you saw an\nold B movie called FerrisBueller's Day Off.Did you see that?So the kid had borrowed\nhis father's--not borrowed, but lifted his\nfather's good car and drove ita lot like so and put\non a lot of mileage.The trip meter was way up, and\nhe knew his father was goingto notice this.So he had the idea to put the\ncar up on a lift, put it inreverse, and go for a\nwhile, and the tripmeter would go backwards.I don't know if trip meters\ndo go backwards.It's kind of tough to watch them\nwhile going in reverse.But if whoever made the car\nunderstood calculus, as youdo, the speedometer--now that I think of it,\nspeedometers don't have abelow zero.They should have. And trip\nmeters should go backwards.I mean, that movie was just made\nfor a calculus person.", "start": 1080.0, "heat": 0.401}, {"text": "Maybe I'm remembering more.I think it didn't work\nor something.And the kid got mad and kicked\nthe car, and it fell off thelift, went through\nthe glass window.Anyway, calculus would\nhave saved him ifonly the car had been--or the meters in the car had\nbeen made correctly.All right, that's one pair.That's our first real pair in\nwhich the speed changes.OK.I thought in this first video,\nlater, even today, I'll get toa case where we have formulas.That's what calculus\nmoves into.When f of t is given by some\nformula, well, here it's givenby a formula: s times t.A simple formula.And then, knowing that, we\nknow that the speed is s.Later, we got more functions.But let me take an example, just\nbecause these pairs offunctions are everywhere.What could I take?Maybe height of a person.Height of a person.OK, so this is now another\nexample, just to get practicein the relation between the\nheight of a person and therate of change of the height.So this is the height.Maybe I'll call it y.Let me write height\nof a person.",

changes.It's the rate of change\nof the height.It's the rate of change.So let me call it s, and it'll\nbe the rate of change.Good if I use those words.Yeah, so I want to think\njust how we grow, atypical person growing.In fact, as I wrote this on\nthe board, I thought ofanother pair.Can I just say it in words, this\nother pair, and then I'llcome back to this one?Here's another pair.This could be money in a bank.Wealth sounds better.Let's call it wealth.That's zippier.And then what is this one?If this is your wealth,\nyour totalassets, what's your worth?This would be the rate\nof change, howquickly you're saving.s could be for saving.Or if you're down here, s\nis for spending, right?If s is positive, that means\nyou're wealth is increasing,you're saving.Negative s means you're\nspending, and your wealth goes", "start": 1320.0, "heat": 0.444}, {"text": "whatever, maybe--I hope-- up.Height is mostly up, right?So let me come back to\nheight of a person.Now, where--oh,

tall.You say long.But then as soon as you can\nstand up, it's tall,so let's say tall.Shall we guessed 20 inches?If that's way off, I apologize\nto everybody.Let me just say 20, 20 inches.OK, at year zero.OK, and then presumably\nyou grow.OK, so you grow a little.What are we headed for?About 60, 70 inches\nor something.Anyway, you grow.Let's say that's 10 years old\nand here is 20 years old.OK, so you grow.Maybe you grow faster\nthan that.Let's say you're a healthy\nperson here.OK, up you grow.And then at about maybe age 12\nor 13, there's a growth spurt.And maybe the point is, how do\nwe see that growth spurt onthe two graphs?", "start": 1440.0, "heat": 0.383}, {"text": "Differently, but it's the\nsame growth spurt.OK, so here your height\nsuddenly jumps up.Boy, yeah, you catch\nup with

when you get\nto about-- oh, I don't know.Whatever.We won't discuss this point.I say when you get too old,\nyou probably lose some.Let's not emphasize that.OK, so here is the--now, what's happening\nover here?Well, it's the slope\nof that graph.So the slope might be--this is time zero, but you're\ngrowing right away.The s graph, the rate\nof growth graph,doesn't start at zero.It starts

long,height actually drops.OK, there is an example\nin which I don't--also I'm sure people have\ndevised approximate formulasfor average growth rates,\nbut you see, I'm not--it's the idea of the relation\nbetween function one andfunction two that\nI'm emphasizing.Now, my last example, let me\ntake one more example, onemore example for this\nfirst lecture.So let me take a case in\nwhich the speed is--so here will be my two--let's use speed.Let's use this as distance.This is distance again,\nand graph two, asalways, will be speed.And I'm going to take\na case in whichit's given by a

sayacceleration.You're accelerating.You're keeping your foot on the\ngas, steadily speeding up,and so then s is proportional\nto t.Now, think about the distance.What's happening\nwith distance?If this is accelerating, you'regoing faster and faster.You're covering more and more\nspeed, more and more distance,more and more quickly.If this is slope, the\nslope is increasing.Look, the graph--let's start the trip\nmeter at zero.So you started with\na speed of zero.You were not really increasing\ndistance until you gotslightly beyond zero,\nand then itslightly started to increase.But then it increases faster\nand faster, right?It never gets infinitely fast,\nbut it keeps going upwards.And the calculus question\nwould becan we give a formula--an equation--for the distance?Because in this case, I guess\nI started with function two,", "start": 1800.0, "heat": 0.163}, {"text": "and therefore, it's function\none that I want to look at.It's always pairs\nof functions.OK, now, let's think

beginning, it has no\nspeed, but of course,instantly it picks up speed.The a would have something to\ndo with the gravitationalconstant for the Earth,\nwhatever, and then maybe--yeah.And what would be\nthe distance?OK, now can I just mention a\nsmall miracle of calculus?A small miracle.I'm going this direction now\nfrom speed to distance so I'mdoing integral calculus.And we'll get to that later.In the first lectures,\nwe're almost alwaysgoing from one to two.But here is a neat fact about\ngoing from two to one, that ifthis is the time t, then, of\ncourse, this height here willbe a times t.And the amazing fact is that\nthis graph tells you the areaunder this one.Graph one--function one--tells you the area under\nthe graph two.And in this example with a nice\nconstant

calculus\nwill tell usthat's function one.So this function is 1/2\nof a times t squared.So there is a function one,\nand here is df dt.If I go back to the first\nletters that I mentioned, ifthis is my function f, then\nthis is my function that--and notice what kind\nof a curve that is.Do you recognize that\nwith a square?That tells me it's a parabola,\na famous and important curve.And, of course, it's important\nbecause ithas such a neat formula.OK, so we have found\nthe function one.We've recovered the information\nin that lost blackbox, the distance box, the trip\nmeter, from what we didfind in black box two, the\nspeed, the record of speed.And notice, I'm using the\nspeed all the wayfrom here to here.The speed kind of tells me how\nthe distance is piled up.The distance is kind of a\nrunning total, where the speed", "start": 2040.0, "heat": 0.19}, {"text": "at that moment is an\ninstant thing.Oh, we have to do that\nin future lectures.The difference between a\nrunning total of totaldistance covered and a speed\nthat's telling me at a moment,at an instant how distance\nis changing.The slope at this very point\nt, that slope isthis height, is at.OK, so there you have\nthe first--well, I'll say the second.The first pair of calculus\nwas this one.f equals st, and it's\nderivative was s.Our second pair is f is this,\nand will you allowme to write df dt?If f is 1/2 of at squared,\nthen df dt is at.You'll see this rule again.The power two dropped\nto a power one.But the two multiplied the thing\nso it canceled the 1/2and just left the a.OK, that's a start on the\nhighlights of calculus.Thanks.NARRATOR: This has been\na production of MITOpenCourseWare and\nGilbert Strang.Funding for this video was\nprovided by the LordFoundation.To help OCW continue to
