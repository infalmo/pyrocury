[{"text": "Today I'm speaking about\nthe first of the three greatpartial differential equations.So this one is called Laplace's\nequation, named after Laplace.And you see partial derivatives.So we have-- I don't have time.This equation is\nin steady state.I have x and y, I'm\nin the xy plane.And I have second\nderivatives in x and then y.So I'm looking for\nsolutions to that equation.And of course I'm given\nsome boundary values.So time is not here.The boundary\nvalues, the boundaryis in the xy plane,\nmaybe a circle.Think about a circle\nin the xy plane.And on the circle, I\nknow the solution u.So the boundary values\naround the circle are given.And I have to find\nthe temperatureu inside the circle.So I know the temperature\non the boundary.I let it settle down and I want\nto know the temperature inside.And the beauty is, it solves\nthat basic partial differentialequation.So let's find some solutions.They might not match\nthe boundary values,but we can use them.So u equal constant certainly\nsolves the equation.U equal x, the second\nderivatives will be 0.U equal y.Here is a better one, x\nsquared minus y squared.So the second derivative\nin the x direction is 2.The second derivative in\nthe y direction is minus 2.So I have 2, minus 2,\nit solves the equation.Or this one, the second\nderivative in x is 0.Second derivative in y is 0,\nthose are simple solutions.",

degree 0, constant.These are degree 1, linear.These are degree 2, quadratic.So I hope for two cubic ones.And then I hope for\ntwo fourth degree ones.And that's the pattern,\nthat's the pattern.Let me find-- let me\nspot the cubic ones.X cubed, if I start with x\ncubed, of course the second xderivative is probably 6x.So I need the second y\nderivative to be minus 6x.And I think minus\n3xy squared does it.The second derivative\nin y is 2 timesthe minus 3x is\nminus 6x, cancelsthe 6x from the second\nderivative there, and it works.So that fits the pattern,\nbut what is the pattern?Here it is.It's fantastic.I get these crazy polynomials\nfrom taking x plus iyto the different powers.Here to the first power, if n\nis 1, and I just have x plus iyand I take the real\npart, that's x.So I'll take the\nreal part of this.The real part of this when\nn is 1, the real part is x.What about when n is 2?Can you square\nthat in your head?", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.384}, {"text": "So we have x

part is x\nsquared minus y squared.And the imaginary\npart was the 2ixy.So the imaginary part that\nmultiplies i is the 2xy.This is our pattern when n is 2.And when n is 3, I take\nx plus iy cubed, and thatbegins with x cubed like that.And then I think that\nthe other real partwould be a minus 3xy squared.I think you should check that.And then there will\nbe an imaginary part.Well, I think I could figure out\nthe imaginary part as I think.Maybe something like\nminus-- maybe it's3yx squared minus y cubed,\nsomething like that.That would be the real\npart and that would bethe imaginary part when n is 3.And wonderfully,\nwonderfully, it worksfor all powers, exponents n.So I have now sort of a pretty\nbig family of solutions.A list, a double list,\nreally, the real partsand the imaginary\nparts for every n.So I can use those\nto find the solutionu, which I'm looking for, the\ntemperature inside the circle.Now of course, I have\na linear equation.", "start": 240.0, "heat":
