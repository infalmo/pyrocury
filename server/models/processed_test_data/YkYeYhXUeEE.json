this morning goes on.Everybody should have a handout.If you do not have\na handout, Aaronwill come around\nand give you oneif you just raise your hand.There's a few in the\nback that just came in.We will be giving out-- look\nfor TAs as you come in the room.We'll have handouts for you\nevery day so look for them.And if you come in late\nwe'll normally leave themin the entrance way here.I know that some of you have\na long walk between classes,so the handouts\nwill be available.So when you come in, grab your\nhandout and come on into class.So now, let me tell you a little\nmore about these things lecturenotes that you can bring a pen\nor pencil to class to write on.So this is the\nsummary for today.So today is really more\nabout announcements and whatwe're going to cover, but\nthere are some featuresof today's handouts that you\ncan use throughout the semester.So lecture summaries\nwill always havethe reading for the class\nfor that day's class.So when you're going back over\nthings and thinking about it,you can always look\nat what readingwas associated with the class.They'll also always have a\nreading for the next class,so you can read\nahead which is goodfor the pre-lecture questions.So now I want to give you\na sense of the material.So we had this on our\nlist of topics today.General information.We've gone through\ncourse material overview", "start": 0.0, "heat":

It is me.This is my college\nyearbook picture.So one day you will\nhave one of these.Who is this?AUDIENCE: It's you.CATHERINE DRENNAN: It's not me.People say that, but thank you.It is Lisa Kudrow.So who knows who Lisa Kudrow is?Friends, yes.So Lisa Kudrow and\nI were classmates.We were in the same year.So you can look at\nwho's next to youand figure out\nwho in your row isgoing to be that famous person\nthat one day you can say, yes,I was classmates with them.So Lisa and I were classmates.What do you think Lisa\nwent to college to study?I heard the correct\nanswer out there.It was in fact biology.What do you think I went\nto college to study?Yes, some people have\nwatched my OpenCourseWareand know these things.Yes, theater, drama,\nbiopsychology.That's kind of like course nine.That's what I was interested in.What do you think\nLisa majored in?AUDIENCE: Bio.CATHERINE DRENNAN: Biology?Or drama?It was biology.What do you think I majored in?It was chemistry.And of course, we all know\nthat Lisa is an actressand I am a chemistry professor.", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.186}, {"text": "So I like to start\nevery class with thisbecause I think it says\nsomething very important.I did not like chemistry\nin high school.I was in chorus.I would schedule every\none of my music lessonsduring the chemistry class.I did everything to avoid\nhaving to attend chemistryin high school, and\nthen I went to collegeand they said you have to take\nchemistry if you're thinkingof a biopsychology major.And I was like, I've\ntaken chemistry.I'm quite convinced\nchemistry is notrelevant to biology in any way.I was told I was wrong.I was sure I was right.I took chemistry and\nrealized that chemistrycan be very different in\ndifferent circumstancesand that everybody can\nfind their appreciationfor chemistry at a different\ntime in their lives.Some of you right now\nalready like chemistry,but a lot of you\nprobably have notfound your love\nfor chemistry yet.Some of you may find\nthat love for chemistryduring this semester.I'm hoping it'll be a\nlarge fraction of you.Some of you may not find\nyour love for chemistryuntil next year or senior\nyear at MIT or evenin graduate school or even\nwhen you have a job later on.Sometimes when I'm traveling\naround-- and as a professorI travel the world\nand give talksand I'm chatting with\nsomeone in an airplaneor on a bus or something and\nthey say, what do you do?And then I say, oh,\nI teach chemistry.And I always kind of watch\nthe reaction to that.And some of them are\nlike, uh, chemistry,and other people say,\nboy, I'm an engineer nowand I have to work with\nchemists all the timeand I really wish I had paid\nmore attention in chemistryclass because we\nneed to work togetherand I need to understand\nmore what they're doing.So some people do not find\ntheir love or their appreciationfor chemistry until they\nhave a career later in life.", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.415}, {"text": "So I'm not sure when it's\ngoing to be for all of you,but if you have\nnot found it yet Iam hoping to find a connection--\nyour connection to chemistry.What about chemistry\nrelates to whatyou want to do in the future?And one reason that I did\nnot appreciate chemistryin high school is\nI didn't reallyunderstand who chemists\nwere and I didn't reallyunderstand what chemistry was.What people used chemistry for.And part of the reason I\nthink were these picturesthat are often shown in\nintro courses for chemistryand in your intro textbooks.That's partly why I\nthink $8 is a good priceto spend on these\nchemistry textbooks.These are great chemists\nbut they're all dead,and that really gives the\nmessage that chemistryis not a living discipline.Chemistry was a thing\nthat people used to doand it was exciting\nat that time,but then when they got\nrid of their powdered wigsthey moved on to other fields.So I'm going to be showing\nyou some different picturesin this class.I'm going to be showing\nyou these pictures.Some of the old pictures\nwill be there too,but every time I show\nyou a dead white guyI want to show you\nsomeone who is alive.So these are living chemists.People who are using chemistry\nevery day of their lives,and I'm going to be showing\nshort videos of these peopletelling you how\nthey're using chemistryand what chemistry is\nbeing used for today.So you'll be hearing-- and\nthis is a series I like callin their own words.Another thing that I didn't\nappreciate about chemistrywas in the lab course I had\na strong base and a weak acidand we would drop,\ndrop, drop, drop,drop until it turned pink.And then we could calculate\nthe molecular weightof an unknown weak acid.And I ask myself, is this\nlike a real pressing problem?A lot of weak acids out there\nsomewhere that if only we", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.223}, {"text": "knew the molecular weight\nthe problems of the worldwould be solved?But it turns out that this\nis kind of a good intro lab,but it's in fact not what\nchemists do every day.We will learn about\ntitrations because weneed to know PKA because\nPKA is important,but we don't have a\nlab and we're not goingto be doing that experiment.So what is chemistry research?Chemistry research is all\nof these following things.So creating quantum dots\nto be used in surgery.How do you know if\nthe doctor's gotthe right amount of a tumor?You don't want to\ntake more fleshthan you need but you don't\nwant to miss some of the cancer.So you want to image exactly\nwhere that cancer is.Chemistry is designing\nsensors to find explosivesin war zones.This is a really important\nproblem right now.Biofuels, energy,\nalternative energy--that's what chemistry is.Using basic principles\nto figure outhow to design better biofuels.Or making new pharmaceuticals.We haven't really\nproduced new antibioticsin a long time in this\ncountry, and a lotof things that we thought used\nto be treatable conditionsnow are no longer so\ntreatable because wedon't have new antibiotics\nand the bugs are becomingresistant to the old ones.This is what chemistry\nresearch is today.This is what you're going to be\nusing chemical principles for.So what chemical\nprinciples are yougoing to be learning that will\nhelp you solve these real worldproblems?So we need to learn\nabout matter and weneed to know how matter reacts.So in the first\nhalf of the coursewe're going to start\nwith atomic theory.There is going to be a\nlittle bit of historyinvolved in that.Talking about the discovery\nof the nucleus, electrons,protons.And so we're going to have\na little bit of historyand some cool demos.We're going to move on\nto the periodic table.That's the chemist toolbox.Those are the elements that\nwe can combine to make things,and when we combine them to\nmake things they need to bondso we're going to\ntalk about bonding.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.146}, {"text": "And they're going\nto form molecules,and we need to think about the\nstructures of those moleculesbecause the structures\ndictate the propertiesof those molecules\nof that matter.And then molecules can react.So we're going to talk\nabout how they react,and whether a reaction is going\nto go is about thermodynamics.Is it going to be spontaneous?But then, we also need to know\nif it's faster or if it's slow.That's kinetics.So we're going to cover\nboth of those things.Chemical equilibrium.You can have a reaction\nthat goes one wayand is going in the reverse\ndirection at the same time.And there'll be an equilibrium\nconstant associatedwith that reaction,\nbut sometimesyou really want to go more\nin the forward directionto make the thing\nyou want to make.So you need to think about\nhow the reaction quotientqueue is related to the\nequilibrium constant K.And if you're the Green\nLantern, equilibrium constantsare meaningless.You have the Green\nLantern ring and youcan push that equilibrium in\nany direction that you want.If you're the Green Lantern,\nQ is always greater than K.But if you're a\nstudent of chemistry,you actually can\nbecome a super heroby learning about those\nchemical principles.And then, you can drive Q to\nbe greater than K as well.So I want to teach you\nhow to be a super hero.I also am going to teach you\nabout solubility and acid baseand oxidation\nreduction reactionsbecause those are really the\nfundamental types of reactionsthat occur in biology, in\nmaterials, and everything.And a little unit on\ntransition metals.That middle part of\nthe periodic tablewhere you have iron and\ncobalt and copper and nickeland all those\namazing elements thatreally allow you to do the most\nchallenging chemical reactions.Those are especially\nfun, and if youwant to have the\npower of chemistryyou've got to know about\nthe transition metals.So without chemistry\nyou wouldn't be alive.Your body are a series\nof chemical reactions.You wouldn't be wearing the\nclothes that you're wearing.Pretty much a\nchemist figured outthe material that you're wearing\nand or how to process it.", "start": 600.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "And I think really importantly,\nyou couldn't spell MIT without.ChemistryWe have the M from\nphysics, the I for math,and we have the\nT from chemistry.So if you want to\nspell MIT you gottalearn about the ideal gas law.And you wouldn't have the paper\nthat you might be currentlywriting on without chemistry.So you really should\nstudy chemistrybecause the major\nchallenges of our timerequire chemistry\nknowledge to fix them.Treating human disease requires\nan understanding of chemistry.Solving the energy problem\nrequires an understandingof chemistry.And I believe people will come\nup with alternative energy.I'm just less convinced\nthat they're notgoing to destroy the\nenvironment while they do it.So I really think we\nneed people thinkingabout solving the energy problem\nwho care about the environmentand can use chemistry\nto think about howwe can protect the environment.So why do I care\nso much about this?And that's because\nyesterday morning Iwalked my daughter to her\nfirst day of first grade.She's six years old.She's starting\nschool, and I needpeople to know chemistry\nto make the world a betterplace for her.So what I can do as a\nmother who's a chemistis find the smartest people\nI can find, which I've done,and

want you to have a working\nknowledge of chemistrythat you can take\nadvanced courses.Starting pretty simple.That's what I want.I also want you to\nknow enough chemistryso you can do a UROP\nin a chemistry lab,and we'll talk more about\nthe undergraduate researchprogram throughout the course.I would like you to employ\nchemistry principalsin a lab that's not a\nchemistry lab in your UROP.I
