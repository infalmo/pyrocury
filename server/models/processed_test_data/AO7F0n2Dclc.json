a\nfavorite moment,like they learn how their goal,\nlike how to achieve goals,like rock the knees.And then after one year,\nthey learn how to clap,how to achieve a means.So for example, I think\nthey do the experimentof putting like a hand in\ntheir ear, like left ear.And then chimpanzees do the\nsame as one-year-old infants.And somehow I believe\nthat, for example,reflexes between infants and\nchimpanzees are very similar.We tend to represent\nthings better,because like we have this--MARVIN MINSKY: You're\ntalking about chimps?AUDIENCE: Chimpanzees.MARVIN MINSKY: Yep.AUDIENCE: They are\nlike apes in general.MARVIN MINSKY: Right.AUDIENCE: I believe\nthere are some apes thatcan learn sign language.I am not sure if that's right.But they can take the goals.And, for example,

Richard Heald.And he did lots of interesting\nexperiments on young animals.So for example, he\ndiscovered that if youtake a cat or a dog, if\nyou have a dog on a leashand you take it\nsomewhere, there'sa very good chance it will\nfind its way back because itremembers what it did.But he discovered if\nyou take a cat or a dogand you take it for a\nwalk and go somewhere,it won't learn because\nit didn't do it itself.So in other words, if you\ntake it on a road passively,even a dozen times\nor 100 times, itwon't learn that path,\nif it didn't actuallyhave any motor reactions.So that was very convincing.And the world became convinced\nthat for spatial learning,you have to participate.Many years later,\nwe were workingwith a cerebral palsy\nguy who had neverlocomoted himself very much.I'm trying to remember\nhis name-- well,name doesn't matter.But the Logo\nproject had started.And he by putting a hat\nwith a stick on his head,", "start": 6120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "he was

aroundand he wanted it\nto go back to here.And everybody\npredicted that he wouldget left and right reversed\nbecause he had never hadany experience in the world.But right off, he knew\nwhich way to do it.So he had learned\nspatial navigationpretty much never having\ndone much of it himself.And Richard Heald\nwas very embarrassed,but had to conclude that what\nyou learned from cats and dogsmight not apply to people.We ran into a little\ntrouble because therewas another psychologist we\ntried to convince of this.And that psychologist\nsaid, well, maybe thiswas-- it took three years for\nhim to
