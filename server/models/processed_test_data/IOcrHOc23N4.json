[{"text": "Here you see footage of hurricanes that formed\nin the Atlantic Ocean during 2009. Do yousee that every single hurricane rotates counterclockwise?\nAll hurricanes formed in the Northern hemisphererotate counterclockwise.In this video, we'll provide you with the\ntools to explain why hurricanes rotate theway that they do.This video is part of the Representations\nvideo series. Information can be representedin words, through mathematical symbols, graphically,\nor in 3-D models. Representations are usedto develop a deeper and more flexible understanding\nof objects, systems, and processes.Hi, my name is Sanjay Sarma, and I am a professor\nof Mechanical Engineering at MIT. Today weare going to demystify the origins of the\nforces that appear to act on objects in rotatingframes.Before watching this video, you should be\nfamiliar with how to define basis vectors;inertial and non-inertial reference frames;\nand the representation of rotation rates asa vector cross products.After watching this video, you will be able\nto explain why centrifugal and Coriolis forcesarise in rotating frames of reference, and\napply your understanding of the Coriolis forceto determine the direction of rotation of\nhurricanes.A frame of reference is a choice of coordinate\nframe, a set of orthonormal basis vectors.The frame is allowed to undergo rigid body\nmotions.Rigid body motions include translation, rotation,\nor a combination of translation and rotation.As a frame of reference undergoes a rigid\nbody motion, the 3 basis vectors retain theirunit length and remain mutually orthogonal.In this video, we are going to focus on rotating\nframes of reference. In particular, we wantto think about frames that are rotating with\nconstant angular velocity and that aren't", "start": 0.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "translating.Rotating frames of reference are non-inertial,\nthus we detect fictitious forces in them.We are going to explain how these so called\nfictitious forces arise.This is a turntable. We say that we are in\nthe turntable frame of reference because thecamera is mounted to the turntable. From this\nframe of reference, it appears that the turntableis stationary as the world spins around us,\ndespite the fact that our experience tellsus it is the turntable that is spinning.Here you see an orange disk attached to the\nturntable by a string. If we rotate the turntablequickly enough to overcome the friction between\nthe disk and the turntable, you notice thatthe string becomes taut.Newton's second law implies that there must\nbe a force equal and opposite to this tensionforce for the disk to remain stationary!This apparent force is what we call a fictitious\nforce. Let's rotate the turntable with twodisks\u2014one is attached to the table by a\nstring, while the other is unattached. Thefictitious force causes the unattached disk\nto fly off of the Turntable.Is there really a force? If so, where does\nit come from? Pause the video and discuss.In addition to the Turntable frame, there\nis another frame of reference that will beuseful in our analysis.This is the ground frame, G, which is any\ncoordinate frame that appears to be stationarywhile standing on the ground.The Turntable frame, T, refers to any coordinate\nframe that appears stationary while standingon the Turntable.From the ground frame, the T frame is rotating\ncounterclockwise with constant angular velocity,or almost constant angular velocity.It is important to be explicit about the particular\nframe of reference used to describe a velocity", "start": 120.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "or acceleration vector.The velocity of the stationary vector is zero\nin the G frame, but the velocity of the rotatingvector is zero in the T frame.We will denote the frame of such a vector\nby using a left superscript G or T to designateif we are considering the vector as an object\nin the G frame or the T frame.In the T frame, the position of the disk is\nfixed, so its velocity and acceleration areboth zero.Pause the video here to determine the velocity\nof the disk as seen from the ground frame.According to the G frame, the T frame is rotating\nwith some angular velocity, represented bythe vector omega. Omega points along the axis\nof rotation with magnitude equal to the angularvelocity. The velocity of the disk according\nto the G frame is entirely due to the rotationof the T frame, and thus can be represented\nby omega cross r.Recall that in general, any object that is\nmoving on the turntable will have a velocitythat can be defined in the T-frame. The velocity\nin the G-frame can be found as the sum ofthe velocity in the T-frame and the velocity\nthat arises due to the rotation of the T-framewith respect to the G-frame.We can think of this as a rule for taking\nthe time derivative of the position vectorr in both the G-frame and the T-frame.We can generalize this as a formula for how\nto take the time derivative in the G frameof any vector, x, in terms of its T-frame\nderivative. This formula holds when the Tframe is rotating, but not translating with\nrespect to the G frame.Use this formula to take the time derivative\nof velocity. Try to find the general formulafor the acceleration in the ground frame in\nterms of the acceleration in the turntable", "start": 240.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "frame and various other terms. Pause the video\nwhile you carry out the computation.Looking at this formula, the first term is\nthe object's acceleration as observed in theT frame. The remaining terms can be thought\nof as giving rise to the fictitious forces,which cause the acceleration observed in the\nT frame. The second term is the due to theangular acceleration of the T frame with respect\nto the G frame. This third term is the Coriolisacceleration\u2014note that it depends on the\nvelocity vector of the object in the T frame.And this last term is the centripetal acceleration\u2014observe\nthat it depends on how far the object is fromthe axis of rotation.Given this information, pause the video and\ndetermine the acceleration of the orange diskin the ground frame?The velocity and acceleration of the disk\nare zero in the T frame of reference.We did our best to rotate the turntable in\nthis video with constant angular velocity.So we will assume that the angular acceleration\nis negligible.Thus the acceleration in the G-frame is given\ncompletely by the centripetal accelerationterm.This vector points in the negative r direction\nwith a magnitude given by the distance fromthe axis multiplied by the angular velocity\nsquared.In the G frame, which is inertial, we do not\nobserve effects of the so-called \"fictitiousforces\". Remember, the disk wants to move\nin a straight line. It doesn't want to turn.", "start": 360.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "The string imparts a tension force upon the\norange disk, which provides the centripetalacceleration needed for the disk to rotate\nwith the Turntable.But in the non-inertial T frame, we may think\nwe observe a \"fictitious force\". The onlything that is fictitious is your perception\nthat the disk is not accelerating. It is a\"physical illusion\" created by the fact that\nfrom the turntable frame of reference, youdon't observe the centripetal acceleration\nof the turntable.In this video clip, we are rolling tennis\nballs through a plastic tube. In the T frame,we observe that the ball moves along a curved\npath. The curved motion observed in a rotatingframe of reference is called the \"Coriolis\nEffect.\"Pause the video and explain what you think\nis causing this curved motion.To better understand what is happening, let's\nlook at the same motion from the inertialground frame.But first, what do you think the motion of\nthe ball will be when observed from the Groundframe? Pause the video and make a prediction.That's right. The path is a rather straight\nline along the initial trajectory!It is the motion of the turntable that is\ncurved as the turntable rotates counterclockwise.But from the turntable frame, points on the\nturntable appear stationary, because you arerotating with the frame. So you perceive that\nthe ball is curving to the right, even thoughit is you that is moving in a circular path.You might try to explain the curvature using\nfictitious forces. But we know that theseforces are really just accelerations of the\nturntable frame that we do not perceive.", "start": 480.0, "heat": 0.1}, {"text": "Let's use what we know about the G frame to\nunderstand what these accelerations are inthe T frame.Using the general formula for acceleration\nin a rotating frame that we found earlier,pause here and determine the acceleration\nin the T frame.Because the velocity is essentially constant\nin the G frame, the G frame acceleration iszero.We can rearrange the remaining nonzero terms\nto find an expression for the accelerationof the ball that we observe in the T frame.\nWe find it is equal and opposite the sum ofthe Coriolis acceleration and the Centripetal\nacceleration.This term is the negative of the Centripetal\nacceleration, which we saw in the previousexample. This acceleration is always pointing\noutwards from the center of rotation.This second term is the negative Coriolis\nacceleration. This acceleration is perpendicularto the velocity of the ball in the T frame,\ncreating the curvature of the ball's path.We've said the accelerations are created by\nthe rotation of the turntable. How does thishappen?For an object to rotate with the turntable,\na centripetal acceleration is required. Withoutit, an object appears to move outwards from\nthe center of rotation.Even more is happening though. Because of\nthe rigid body rotation, the velocity of apoint near the outside edge of the turntable\nis greater than the velocity of point nearthe center of rotation.Moving objects accelerate due to this velocity\ndifferential. The acceleration is perpendicularto the velocity of the object. But you don't\nrealize this acceleration exists from theturntable frame, because you don't perceive\nyour own rotation.The acceleration created by this velocity\ndifferential between points on the turntableis responsible for the Coriolis effect, curving\nthe paths of moving objects.You can feel these accelerations yourself\nif you walk around on a carousel.

Even though we are used to consideringthe Earth as a fixed frame, some phenomena,\nsuch as hurricanes, are created by the rotationof the Earth. We are going to use what we\nlearned earlier to understand why hurricanesrotate the way they do.We can model regions of the Earth quite easily.\nFor points that are in the Northern or Southernhemisphere, but sufficiently far from the\nequator, we can model the hemisphere by projectingit onto a disk.From this perspective, the northern hemisphere\nis a counterclockwise rotating disk, and thesouthern hemisphere is a clockwise rotating\ndisk.Near the equator, we can't model the Earth\nas a disk. Instead, a better model would bethe outside surface of a rotating cylinder.Our understanding of the Coriolis Effect from\nthe turntable will directly apply to thismodel of the hemispheres.Now let's start by thinking about hurricanes.\nHurricanes are formed when there are smallregions of very low air pressure. The existence\nof this low-pressure region causes air fromall directions to move towards the low-pressure\nzone.With this information and what you know about\nthe Coriolis effect, explain why hurricanesin the northern hemisphere rotate counterclockwise.As air moves towards the low-pressure zone,\nthe air moving from the south veers to theright due to the Coriolis effect. Similarly,\nair moving from the north veers to the leftof the low-pressure zone. At the same time,\nair is constantly pulled in towards the low-pressurezone. The combination of these processes creates\na region of counterclockwise rotating air.", "start": 720.0, "heat": 0.236}, {"text": "This is why hurricanes in the Northern hemisphere\nrotate counterclockwise.In this video, we saw that in rotating frames,\nan apparent force pulling away from the axisof rotation is really the objects tendency\nto move in a straight line.In a rotating frame of reference, objects\nrequire a centripetal acceleration to remainstationary in that frame.Moving objects in rotating frames move in\ncurved paths due to the Coriolis acceleration,created by the fact that the velocity of points\nin the frame are greater further from theaxis of rotation.On Earth, we can observe the Coriolis Effect\nin the counterclockwise rotation of hurricanesin the northern hemispheres.This leaves 2 questions for you.
