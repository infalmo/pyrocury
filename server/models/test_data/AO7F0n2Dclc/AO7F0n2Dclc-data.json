There is one problem in the artificial intelligence people, is there's a lot of pretty smart people like Steve Pinker and others who think that the problem of consciousness is maybe the most important problem no matter what we do in artificial intelligence. Anybody read Pinker? I can't figure out what his basic view is. But there's a feeling that if you can't solve this all important mystery, then maybe whatever we build will be lacking in some important property. There was another family of AI skeptics, like Penrose, who's a physicist and a very good physicist",

AUDIENCE: Quantum mechanics. MARVIN MINSKY: Quantum mechanics was one and Godel's theorem, incompleteness was another. And for example, if you try to prove Godel's theorem in any particular logic, you'll find some sort of paradox appearing where if you try to formalize the proof, you can't prove it in the logical system you're proving it about. I forget what that's called. So there are these strange logical and semi-philosophical problems that bother people. And Pinker's particular problem is, he doesn't see how you could make a machine be conscious. And in particular, he doesn't see how a machine could have a sense called qualia, which",

Does anybody have an explanation of why computers take the same amount of time to reboot, even though they're 1,000 times faster than they were? AUDIENCE: They have to load 1,000 times more stuff nowadays. MARVIN MINSKY: Yes, but why can't it load the things that were running last time? For some reason, they feel they have to load everything. AUDIENCE: Maybe there is a certain amount of time that they think humans are willing to wait, so therefore, they will load as much as they can during that time. Maybe that might be it. I think if they could, they would upload even more, but they can't because that's how the human patience. And so they always run out of that one. MARVIN MINSKY: Does the XO take time to do?",

But it doesn't cost much to keep a dynamic memory refreshed for a month or two. If anybody can figure it out, I'd like to know because it seems to me that it should be easy to make Unix remember what state it was in. AUDIENCE: Well, if it remembered exactly what state it was in, it wouldn't be very useful. We'd have to change the statement every time. MARVIN MINSKY: Well, I mean it could know which applications you've been running or something. Anyway it's a mystery to me. For example, in time sharing systems, you have many users. And the time shared system keeps their state working fine. Let's see if this is actually recovered from its bug.",

And because the first evidence for forms of life occurred about 400 million years ago, which is pretty long. The earth appears to be about 4 billion years. So life didn't start up right away. And so there was a 100 million years of the first one celled animals. Maybe there were some million years of molecules that didn't leave any trace at all. So before there was a cell membrane, you could imagine that there was a lot of evolution. But nobody has posed a plausible theory of what it could have been. There are about five or six pretty good theories of how life might have started. There had to be some way of making a complex molecule that could make copies of itself. And one standard theory is that if you had just the right kind",

And then there's 100 million years of things leading to the various invertebrates, and 100 million years of fish, reptile like things and mammals.

The dolphins developed, which have very large brains somewhat like ours in that they have a big cortex, developed before that. And I forget, does anybody know? My recollection is that they stopped developing about 4 million years ago. So the dolphins brains got to a certain size. The fossil ones of I think about 4 million years ago are comparable to the present ones. So nobody knows why they stopped. But there are a lot of reasons why it's dangerous to make a larger brain. And especially if you're not a fish, because it would be slower and hard to get around and you would have to eat more and that's a bad combination. And other little bugs like taking longer to mature.",

In fact, if you think of the number of generations of humans since presumably they've been living for sort of 20 year lifespan for most of that 4 million years, like other primates. Compare that to bacteria. Some bacteria can reproduce every 20 minutes instead of 20 years or 10 years or whatever it is. So the evolution of smaller animals is vastly faster, in fact, by factors of order of hundreds. And so generally these big slow long-lived animals have huge evolutionary disadvantages. Anyway, here's four major ones. So what made up for that and that's why chapter 4.",

And a lot of that comes from this evolutionary problem that as you got smarter and heavier, it got more and more difficult to survive. So your collection of resourcefulness had to keep track. Well, in that four billion years this only happened once. Well, the octopuses are pretty smart. And the birds, just consider how much a bird does with its sub pea sized brain. But it seems to me that it's hard to generalize from the evolution of humans to anything else because-- because what? We must have been unbelievably lucky. William Calvin has an interesting book. He's a neurologist who writes pretty interesting things about the development of intelligence. And he attributes a lot of human superiority",

And he's a very good technical philosopher. So if you're interested in anything about AI, if you just search for Aaron Sloman, he's the only one. So Google will find him instantly for you. And he's got dozens of really deep essays about various aspects of intelligence and problem solving. The only other philosopher I think is comparable is Daniel Dennett. But Dennett is more concerned with classical philosophical issues and a little less concerned with exactly how does the human mind work. So to put it another way Aaron Sloman writes programs and Dennett doesn't. AUDIENCE: He's basically a classical philosopher.",

MARVIN MINSKY: Yeah. But I'm not sure we can learn very much. AUDIENCE: No. MARVIN MINSKY: I love classical philosophy. But the issues they discuss don't make much sense anymore. Philosophy is where science has come from. But philosophy departments keep teaching what they were. What chapter does this story first appear in? Joan is part way across the street. She's thinking about the future. She sees and hears a car coming and makes a quick decision about whether to back up or run across. And she runs across. And I have a little essay about the kinds of issues there, if you ask what was going on in Joan's mind?",

He says this is the big central problem. What is this amazing thing called consciousness. And he calls that the hard question of psychology. But if you look at this and say, how did she select the way to choose among options?",

And if you look at it as from the point of view of a programmer, you could say, how could a program that's keeping push down lists and various registers and caches and blah, blah, blah, how would a program do this one? How do you think about what you've recently done? Well, you must have made a representation of it. Maybe you had a push down list and we're able to back up and go to the other state. But then the state of you that's wondering how to describe that other state wouldn't be there anymore. So it looks like you need to have two copies of a process or some way to timeshare the processor or whatever. And so if you dwell on this kind of question for a while, then you say there's something wrong with Pinker. Yes, he's talking about a very hard problem. But he's got blurred maybe 20, 30, 100, I don't know, pretty hard problems. And each of these is fairly hard.",

How do you go from a verbal description to block supporting a third block to a visual image if you have one? Well, you could think of a lot of ways those-- I didn't say what shape the blocks were and so forth. And you can think of your mind. One part of your mind can see the other part trying to figure out which way to arrange those blocks. Maybe all three blocks are just vertically like this, this and this. That's two blocks supporting a third block. And so instead of saying consciousness is the hard problem, you could say consciousness is 30 pretty hard problems. And I bet I could make some progress on each of them if I spent two or three years or if I had 30 students spending or whatever.

And I used to hang around there when I spent a term at Stanford. And it had a lot of visual exhibits with optical illusions and colored lights doing different things and changes of perspective and a lot of binocular vision tricks. And there's a problem with that kind of exhibit-- we have them here in the science museum too-- which is that about 15% or 20% of people don't see stereo very well. And at least 10% don't view stereo images at all. And some of these is because one eye's vision is very bad. But actually if one eye is 20/20 and the other eye is 20/100,",

And a certain percentage don't fuse stereo for no reason that anybody can measure and so forth. But that means that if a big family is looking at this exhibit, probably one of them is only pretending that he or she can see the illusion. And I couldn't figure out any way to get out of that. But I thought if you make a museum, you should be sure to include some exhibits for the-- what's the name for a person who only-- is there a name for non-fusers? When you get a pilot's license, you have to pass a binocular vision test, which seems awfully pointless to me, because if you need stereo, which only works for about 30 feet, then you're probably dead anyway, maybe the last half",

And I picked out four kinds of processes that are self models, mock whatever you're doing. There are probably a few parts of your brain that are telling little stories or making visual representations or whatever, showing what you've been doing mentally or physically or emotionally or whatever distinctions you want to draw. Different parts of your brain are keeping different historical narrations and representations maybe over different time scales. And so I'm imagining. I'm just picking on four different things that are usually happening at any time in your mind. And these two diagrams are describing or representing two mental activities.",

So one side of your mind, which is sort of performing actions, could be having four processes. And I'm using pretty much the same-- they're not quite. Wonder why I changed one and not the others. And then there's another part of your mind that's monitoring the results of these little actions as you're solving a problem. And those involve pretty much the same kinds of different processes, making models of how you've changed yourself or deciding what to remember. As you look at the situation that you're manipulating, you notice some features and you change your descriptions of the parts so that you were-- in other words, in the course of solving a problem, you're making all sorts of temporary records",

Do you feel there's a great difference between the things you're doing that you're conscious of and the often equally complicated things that you're doing that you can say much less about? How do you recognize the two? Do you say I've noticed this interval and that interval, and then in the next four measures we swap those intervals and we put this one before that instead of after? If you look at Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, there's a couple of inversions. And if you're a musician, you might, in fact, be thinking geometrically as these sounds are coming in and processing them. Some composers know a great deal about what they're doing.

And very likely you don't have any really scary associations with green things. So when people say the quality of red, it's so different from green. Well maybe it's like the differences over being stabbed or not. And it's not very subtle. And philosophically it's hard to think of anything puzzling about it. You might ask, why is it so hard to tell the difference between pleasure and pain or to describe it? And the answer is you could go on for hours describing it in sickening and disgusting detail without any philosophical difficulty at all. So what do you think of redness? You think of tomatoes and blood. And what are the 10 most common things? I don't know. But I don't see that in the discussion of qualia.",

But in fact, if you look at the visual system, there are different cells for those, which are sensitive to different spectra. But the color of a region in the visual field does not depend on the color of that region, so much as the difference between it and other regions near it. So I don't have any slides to show that. But the first time you see some demonstrations of that, it's amazing because you always thought that when you look at a patch of red, you're seeing red. But if the whole visual field is red slightly, you hardly can tell at all after a few seconds what the background color is. So I'm going to stop talking about those things.",

And I'm not sure what-- AUDIENCE: So like at a moment you have a set of K-lines that are active. MARVIN MINSKY: Right, but as you mentioned in different people, they're probably different. AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah. MARVIN MINSKY: So when you say red and I say red, how similar are they? That's a wonderful question. And I don't know what to say. How would we measure that?

The frog probably has them built in. AUDIENCE: Yeah. And probably it's very similar because we have centers in our brain. So, for example, for vision, we have a center. And probably like things that are close by will have a tendency to blend together. And so red would be similar to each one of us because it's very low level concept. But if you go higher, it probably, for example, for numbers to have different representation than red. I think there's started off by learning that we represent numbers by saying, like there is another person that presents just by seeing the number. And then you got to see it. MARVIN MINSKY: He has an interesting idea that maybe in the first few layers of visual circuits, we all share. They're pretty similar. And so for the primary-- for the first three or four levels of visual processing, the kinds of events that happen for when red and green",

MARVIN MINSKY: I think what I'll do is-- I saw a phaser on the third floor somewhere. Maybe I'll borrow their red one and see if it's different from mine. Well, let me conclude because I-- I think this really raises lots of wonderful questions.",

But that doesn't mean that they're simple. That means-- The reason you have so many words for describing simple states, feelings, and so forth is that not that they are simple and a lot of different things that have nothing to do with one another, but that each of those is a very complicated process.

And it was really getting very bad. That's why I was driving down because I didn't know what to do and I had a dentist here. And after a while, it's sort of fills up my mind. And I'm saying this is very dangerous because maybe I shouldn't be driving. But if I don't drive, it will get worse. So I really should drive very fast. So what is pain? Pain is a reaction of some very smart parts of your mind to the malfunctioning of other very smart parts. And to describe it you would have to have a really big theory of psychology with more parts than in Freud or in my Society Of Mind, book which has only about 300 pages, each of which describes some different aspect of thinking. So if something takes 300 pages to describe, this fools you into thinking, oh, it's indescribable. It must be elemental. It couldn't be mechanical.",

The average intelligent human being is incapable of saying, oh, I see, this will go that way. A normal person can't understand those four little gears. So, of course, pain seems irreducible, because maybe it involves 30 or 40 parts and another 30 or 40 of your little society of mind processes are looking at them. And none of them know much about how the others work. And so the way you get your PhD in philosophy is by saying, oh, I won't even try. I will give an explanation for why I can't do it, which is that it's too simple to say anything about. That's why the word qualia only appears once in The Emotion Machine book.

Or even if it were perfectly balanced, there's a certain quantum probability that its position and momentum are conjugate. So even if I try to position it very precisely, it will have a certain momentum and eventually fall over. It might take a billion years or it might be a few seconds. So if we take any situation, we could ask how many things are affecting the state of this system and how large are they? So how many causes, a few causes or a lot? And what are the effects of each of those? So a good example is a gas, if you add a cylinder and a piston.",

And if there are a large number of small causes, then neural networks and fuzzy logic might be a way to handle a situation like that. And if there is a very small number of large causes, then some kind of logic will work. Sometimes there are two causes that are XOR-ed. So if they're both on, nothing happens. If they're both off, nothing happens. And if just one is on, you get a large effect. And you just say it's X or Y, and analogies and example-based reasoning. So these are where AI is good, I think.

There are lots of places you can make money by not using symbolic reasoning. And there are lots of things, which are pretty interesting problems here. And of course, what we want to do is get to this region where the machines start solving problems that people are no good at. So who has a question or a complaint? AUDIENCE: I have a question.

The second part of that question is, how do we know this is what they had in mind when they initially created the word consciousness? MARVIN MINSKY: That's a nice question. Where did the word consciousness come from? And would we be better off if nobody had that idea? I think I talked about that a little bit the other day that there's the sort of legal concept of responsibility. And if somebody decided that they would steal something, then they become a thief. And so it's a very useful idea in society for controlling people to recognize which things people do are deliberate and involve some reflection and which things are because they're learnable. It's a very nice question.",

AUDIENCE: People that do that, do you think they are doing some mistake? Like do you think there would be more advance into representing intelligence in another way and try to program that? MARVIN MINSKY: The problem is this. Suppose you have-- here's some system that has a bunch of gadgets that affect each other, just a lot of interactions and dependencies. And you want to know if it's in a certain state, what will be the next state. So suppose you put a lion and a tiger in a cage. And how do you predict what will happen?

So to me, anybody who's working on statistical learning is very smart. And he's doing what we did in 1960 and quit, 50 years out of date. What you need is a smart way to make a hypothesis about what's going on. Now if nothing's going on except rounding and motion, then statistical learning is fine. But if there's an intricate thing like a differential, which is this thing and that thing summing up in a certain way, how do you decide to find the conditional probability of that hypothesis?",

And I just-- So here's the thing. If you have a theory of statistical learning, then your job is to find an example that it works on. It's the opposite of what you want for intelligence, which is, how do you make progress on a problem that you don't know the answer to or what kind of answer? So how did they generate? I don't know. Are you up on-- how do the statistical Bayesian people decide which conditional probability to score? Suppose these 10 variables, then there's 2 to the 10th or 1,000 conditional probabilities to consider. If there's 100 variables-- and so you can do it. 2 to the 10th is nothing.",

What did they say about that problem? AUDIENCE: Trial and error. MARVIN MINSKY: What? AUDIENCE: Largely trial and error. MARVIN MINSKY: Yeah, but what do you try when it's 10 to 30th? Yeah. So do they say, I quit, this theory is not going to solve hard problems. So once you admit that, and say I'm working on something that will solve lots of easy problems, more power to you.

MARVIN MINSKY: Suppose there is a set of data, then what's the shortest description you can make of it? And that will give you a chance of having a very good explanation. Now what Solomonoff did was say, suppose that something's happened, and you make all possible descriptions of what could have happened, and then you take the shortest one, and see if that works and see what it predicts will happen next. And then you take-- say, it's all binary, then there's two possible descriptions that are one bit longer. And maybe one of them fits the data. And the other doesn't. So you give that one half the weight. And so Solomonoff imagines an infinite sum where you take all possible computer programs and see which of them produce that data set. And if they produce that data set, then you run the program one more step and see what it does. In other words, suppose your problem is you see a bunch of data about the history of something,",

Well, you make all possible descriptions of that data set and weight the shortest ones much more than the longer descriptions. So the trouble with that is that you can't actually compute such things because it's sort of an uncomputable. However, you can use heuristics to approximate it. And so there are about a dozen people in the world who are making theories of how to do Solomonoff induction. And that's where-- Now another piece of advice for students is if you see a lot of people doing something, then if you want to be sure that you'll have a job someday, do what's popular, and you've got a good chance.

But if you take like Bayesian learning and we kind of advice sometimes like let's say we see something with very small probability and we type just like this part of that is never considered any good. Would that kind of like be like what we're trying to do with getting representations and things? I mean-- MARVIN MINSKY: Yeah, I think-- AUDIENCE: Would this make it much more discrete and kind of make it much more easier and more attractable?

MARVIN MINSKY: I think-- say there's the statistical thing and there's the question of-- suppose there's a lot of variables x1, x2, x 10 to the ninth, 10 to the fifth. Let's say there's 100,000 variables. Then, there's 2 to the 100,000 Pijs. But it isn't ij, it's ij up to 10,000 subscript. So what you need is a good idea for which things to look at. And that means you want to take commonsense knowledge and jump out of the Bayesian knowledge. The problem with a Bayesian learning system is you're estimating the values of conditional probabilities. But you have to decide which conditional probabilities to estimate the values. And the answer is--",

Look at history and you'll see 1,000 years go by, what was the population of the world between 500 AD, between the time of Augustine and the time of Newton, or 1500, like O'Brien, those people, 1,000 years? And I don't know is there 100 million people in the world, anybody know? About how many people were there in 1500? Don't they teach any history? I think history starts-- I changed schools around third grade. So I never-- there was no European history. So to me American history is recent and European history is old. So 1776 is after 1815. That is, to me, history ends with Napoleon, because then I got into fourth grade. Don't you all have that? You've got gaps in your knowledge because the curricula aren't-- somebody should make a map of those.",

AUDIENCE: This is from Wikipedia. MARVIN MINSKY: Well. AUDIENCE: It's on the timeline of people. MARVIN MINSKY: OK. So there's half a billion people, not thinking of the planets going in eclipses. So why is that? How is a Bayesian person going to make the right hypothesis if it's not in the algebraic extension of the things they're considering? I mean, it could go and it could look it up in Wikipedia. But Bayesian thing doesn't do that. RAIs will. Yeah. AUDIENCE: But when we are kids, don't we learn the common sense knowledge? MARVIN MINSKY: Well-- I'm saying what happened in the 1,000 years? You actually have to tell people to consider. I'm telling the Bayesians to quit that and do something smart. Somebody has to tell them. I don't meet up with Newton. But they need one. What are they doing? What do they hope to accomplish?",

Yes. Now there are several ways to fix this. One is to freeze you and just never thaw you out. But we don't want to be stuck with people like us for the rest of all time, because, you know, there isn't much time left. The sun is going to be a red giant in three billion years.

But emotions you described as like states of mind. And if you have like, for, example n states of mind that represent-- I don't know-- log n bits of information, why should we spend so much time talking about like so new information? MARVIN MINSKY: Talking about? AUDIENCE: Little information. Like if we had n states or n emotions, they would represents log n bits of information. And like that's very different information that they will see. So for example if I'm happy or sad, like if I had just two states, happy or sad? MARVIN MINSKY: If we just had two states, you couldn't compute anything. I'm not sure what you're getting at. AUDIENCE: Like emotions seem too little information. They don't represent much information inside our brain.",

When you've read 100 books, you've read them all, except for science fiction. That's my standard joke, that I don't think much of literature except-- because the science fiction people say what would happen if people had a different set of emotions or different ways to think? Or one of my favorite ones is Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, who just wrote a couple of volumes about what about a creature that has one big hand in two little hands. Do you remember what it's called? The Gripping Hand. This is for holding the work, while this one holds the soldering iron and the solder. That's right. That's how the book sort of begins. And there is imagination. On the other hand, you can read Jane Eyre. And it's lovely. But do you end up better than you are or slightly worse? And if you read hundreds of them-- luckily she only wrote 10, right?",

MARVIN MINSKY: I think you're right in the sense that I'll bet that if you take each of those highly advanced brain centers, and say, well it's got something generating hypotheses maybe or something. But underneath it, you probably have something very like a Bayesian reinforcement thing. So they're probably all over the place and maybe of 90% of your machinery is made of little ones. But it's the symbolic things and the K-lines that give them the right things to learn. But I think you raise another question, which I'm very sentimental about because of the history of how our projects got started, namely nobody knew much about how children develop in 1900. For all of human history, as far as I know, generally babies are regarded as like ignorant adults. There isn't I there aren't much theories",

But then he studied these children and he wrote several books about how they learned.

And the greatest laboratory on child psychology in the world faded away. It's closed now. And nothing like it ever started again. So there's a strange thing, maybe the most important part of human psychology is what happens the first 10 years, first 5 years? And if you're interested in that, you could find a few places where somebody has a little grant to do it. But what a tragedy. Anyway, we tried to do some of it here. But Papert got more interested in-- and Cynthia here-- got more interested in how to improve early education than find out how children worked. Is there any big laboratory at all doing that any? Where is child psychology? There are a few places, but none of them are famous enough to notice. AUDIENCE: For a while there was stuff in Ontario, and Brazelton. MARVIN MINSKY: Brazelton Yeah. Anyway.",

And then after one year, they learn how to clap, how to achieve a means. So for example, I think they do the experiment of putting like a hand in their ear, like left ear. And then chimpanzees do the same as one-year-old infants. And somehow I believe that, for example, reflexes between infants and chimpanzees are very similar. We tend to represent things better, because like we have this-- MARVIN MINSKY: You're talking about chimps? AUDIENCE: Chimpanzees. MARVIN MINSKY: Yep. AUDIENCE: They are like apes in general. MARVIN MINSKY: Right. AUDIENCE: I believe there are some apes that can learn sign language. I am not sure if that's right. But they can take the goals. And, for example, dogs can achieve a goal.

            "text": " Maybe that's because of how they represent things, maybe they represent badly. They don't have good hierarchy. MARVIN MINSKY: There's some very interesting questions about that. That's why we need more laboratories. But here's an example. We had a researcher at MIT named Richard Heald. And he did lots of interesting experiments on young animals. So for example, he discovered that if you take a cat or a dog, if you have a dog on a leash and you take it somewhere, there's a very good chance it will find its way back because it remembers what it did. But he discovered if you take a cat or a dog and you take it for a walk and go somewhere, it won't learn because it didn't do it itself. So in other words, if you take it on a road passively, even a dozen times or 100 times, it won't learn that path, if it didn't actually have any motor reactions. So that was very convincing. And the world became convinced that for spatial learning, you have to participate.",

The senator said, research on children how they learn. And Nixon said, that's great idea. Let's put a billion dollars into it. And he couldn't convince anybody in his party to support this idea. The only good thing I've heard about Nixon except for opening China, I guess. He was determined to do something about early education. Oh, the teachers union couldn't stand it. He didn't get any support from the education business I'll probably remember the senator next. Who's next? Yes. AUDIENCE: So it's kind of along the same lines. So if we come out thinking about how we represent things, even if we think about language itself,",

So for example, if we're going to learn like how certain letters come one after the other or how they go, we kind of listen and we see that it's the way everyone else does it. And there are certain words that exist and certain words don't exist, even if they could exist. I guess these are all like statistical learning. And then like after this structure is there, we use this structure to make this representation. So isn't it-- like wouldn't it kind of be right to say that these two are basically the same thing, just that the representation, the more complex one is just another version of the statistical learning where we've just done it? MARVIN MINSKY: Well there's context free grammar. And there's the grammars that have push down lists and stacks and things like that. So you actually need something like a programming language",

AUDIENCE: The brain influenced tail cut off representation. MARVIN MINSKY: Yeah. Why is language restricted in that you can't embed clauses past the level of two or three, which Chomsky never admitted. AUDIENCE: Can't it be the case that we also learn that?

If it doesn't try another way. It can't distance itself from like learning the number of words that usually happen in a clause. Is it this type of learning? MARVIN MINSKY: Well I'm not sure why is it very different from learning that you have to open a bottle-- open the box before you take the thing out. We learn procedures. I'm not sure-- I don't believe in grammar, that is. AUDIENCE: If we were trying to teach a machine to be like a human being, would we just lay out the very basics and let it grow like a child with learning or would we put these representations in there, like put the representations-- MARVIN MINSKY: Well, a child doesn't learn language unless there are people to teach it. AUDIENCE: Right. MARVIN MINSKY: However-- AUDIENCE: So maybe we can expose the machine to that white board to-- or we can expose it to the world somehow to some kind of input. MARVIN MINSKY: I'm not sure what question you're asking. Is all children's learning of a particular type or are they learning frames or are they learning grammar rules",

So there's a machine, should we makes machines as infants and let them learn things, by for example giving them a string that's from the internet, from communication over the internet or communication among other human beings, just like a child learns from seeing his parents talk. MARVIN MINSKY: Several people have-- AUDIENCE: Is it better to actually inject all that knowledge into the machine, and then expect it to act on it from the beginning? MARVIN MINSKY: Well, if you look at the history, you'll find that-- I'm not sure how to look it up. But quite a few people have tried to make learning systems that start with very little and keep developing. And the most impressive ones were the ones by Douglas Lenat. But eventually he gave up. And he had systems that learned a few things. But they petered out. And he changed his orientation to trying to build up commonsense libraries. But I'm trying to think of the name for self-organizing systems.",

MARVIN MINSKY: Of course, the early ones you had to train for an hour. AUDIENCE: But we now have so many more examples and exemplars that you can much better characterize their ability, which is tremendous, between the people. And you typically have multiple models, a lot of different models of how-- so it knows in a space of how people say different things and allowing you to characterize it really well, so it will do a much better job. You always do better if you have models of a given person speaking and modeling their voice. But you can now model a population much better when you have so much more data. MARVIN MINSKY: They're really getting useful. AUDIENCE: Oh, dear. MARVIN MINSKY: OK, unless somebody has a really urgent question. Thanks for coming.",
