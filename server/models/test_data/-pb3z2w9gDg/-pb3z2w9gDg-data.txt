            "text": " over the years, I got lots of reactions from young people in high school, for example. Almost all of whom liked \"The Society of Mind,\" and found it easy to read, and seem to understand it. There are lots of criticisms by older people who maybe some of them found it harder to put so many fragments together. Who knows? But most of this class, most of the things I'd like to say are in those books. So it's really like a big seminar, and my hope is that everyone who comes to this class would have a couple of questions that they'd like to discuss. And if I can't answer them, maybe some others of you can. So I like to think of this as a super seminar, and normally, I don't prepare lectures. And I just start off asking if there are any questions. And if there are not, I get really pissed off. But anyway, I'm going to start with a series of slides. So why do we need machines? And partly, there are a lot of problems.",

And I thought it was very strange for a person to have a first name just being a letter rather than a name. Many years later when I was at Princeton in graduate school, I met the Robert Oppenheimer, and that was a great pleasure. And in fact, he took me to lunch with a couple of other people I admired, namely, Girdle and Einstein, which was very exciting. Except I couldn't understand Einstein, because I wasn't used to people with a strong German accent. But I understood Girdle just fine. And after that lunch was over, I went and spent about a year learning about Turing machines, and trying to prove theorems about them, and so forth. So anyway, in the course of these talks, we'll run across a few of these people.",

It would be nice to have met Aristotle, because no one really knows much about him. But you really should read, just skim through some of that, and you'll find that this is a really smart guy. We don't know if he wrote this stuff, or if it were compiled by his students, like a lot of Feynman's writing is and Von Neumann's writing is edited from notes by their students. Anyway, the astonishing thing about Aristotle is that he seems to be slightly more imaginative than most cognitive scientists you'll run into in the present day.

And he says, they have the particular appearance, because the rays of light bounce many times before they get to the surface. So you can't tell where they started. And I don't find in eastern philosophy theories that say, here's what, I think, and here's a reason why. I've looked at Buddhist stuff, and it's strange lists of psychological principles. Every one of which looks pretty wrong, and they make nice two dimensional diagrams. But no evidence for any of them, so I don't know whether to take it seriously.

PROFESSOR: OK, I think this is a serious argument. It seems to me that science began a little bit in China, a little bit in India. In the Arabic world, they got up to the middle of high school algebra, but then-- AUDIENCE: That's the foundation. PROFESSOR: What? AUDIENCE: That's the foundation. PROFESSOR: Well, but it wasn't as good as Archimedes, who got to the beginning of calculus. So if you look at most cultures, they never got to the critical point of getting theories, doing experiments, discussing them, and then throwing them out. And so if you look at Buddhist philosophy, it's 2,500 years old. If you look at Greek physics, yes, Archimedes almost got calculus, and he got lots of nice principles.

And usually, it went wrong, because barbarians came in and-- well, you know what happened to Archimedes. Some Roman killed him. Anyways-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. I'm sorry. PROFESSOR: No, it's a good question. Why didn't science happen a million years ago? Because humans are five million years old, so what took it so long? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: No, it's more-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Sure, OK. Do you have a theory of why science didn't develop for so long? In most cultures, it might be religion, which is a sort of science that doesn't use evidence, and in fact, kills people who try to get it. So there are systematic reasons why most cultures failed, and maybe somebody has written it. Is there a book on why science disappeared, except once? It's rather remarkable. Isn't it? After all, the idea, if somebody says something, and somebody else says, OK, let's do an experiment to see if that's right, you don't have to be very bright. So how come it didn't happen all the time everywhere?",

Whether it's science [INAUDIBLE] as a thought problem. PROFESSOR: History is full of flukes. I'm trying to remember who wrote that nice book about the plague, some woman. And she mentions that this was spread by rats and fleas or something. And 30% or 40% of the population of many countries in Europe died, and the next generation had a lot of furniture. The standard of living went way up, so anyway, here's a list of disasters.",

But he has lots of obvious disasters, like some high school student looks up the genetic sequence for smallpox virus has been published, and now, you can write a list of nucleotides and send it somewhere. And they'll make it for about $0.50 or $1 per nucleotide. So for a couple of hundred dollars, you can make a virus or a few hundred. So one possibility is that some high school student makes some smallpox only gets it wrong, and it kills everyone. So there are lots of disasters like that, and no one knows what to do about that. Because the DNA synthesis machinery is becoming less and less expensive, and probably the average rich private high school could afford one. So there are lots of other things that could happen.",

An interesting fact is that since 1950 when the first antibiotics started to appear, as I mentioned, I was a kid in the 1940s. And penicillin had just hit the stands, and there wasn't much of it. And there was a researcher who lived a few blocks from us whose dog had cancer. So its father-- I don't know what you call the owner of a dog. --sneaked some penicillin out of the lab and gave it to the dog, who died anyway. But he said, well, nobody's tried penicillin on cancer yet. Maybe it will work. And a lot of people were mad at him, because he probably cost some human its life. But he said, he might have saved a billion humans their lives, so ethics. Ethicists are people who give reasons not to do things, and I'm not saying they're wrong. But it's a funny job.",

So it's 60 years since 1950, so that's five of those six. So they're living six or seven years longer now than they were when I was born. And somebody mentioned that curve stopped the last few years for other reasons, but anyway, if you extrapolated, you'll find that the lifespan is going to keep increasing. How much we don't know-- another problem is that you might discover enough about genetics to get rid of most of the serious diseases. Maybe just 20 or 30 genes are responsible for most deaths right now. And if you could fix those, which we can't do yet, there's no way to change a gene in a person. Because invading all the cells is a pretty massive intervention, but we'll get around that. And then it might be that people suddenly",

So all the work has to be done by 200 or 300-year-olds, and let's hope they're good and healthy. So anyway, I think it's very important that we get smart robots, because we're going to have to stem the population. And I hope people will live longer and blah, blah, blah. So these robots have to be smart enough to replace most people, and how do you make something smart? Well, artificial intelligence is the field whose goal with has been to make machines that do things that we regard as smart, or intelligent, or whatever you want to call it. And the idea of seriously making machines smart has roots that go back to a few pioneers, like Leibniz, who wrote about automata and that sort of thing.",

The first form of the general purpose computer appears really in the 1920s and '30 with the work of a mathematician, Emil Post at NYU, who I happen to never meet. But we had some friends in common, and he had the idea of production rules. And basically, rule based systems and prove various theorems about them. Then Kurt Girdle showed that, if you had something, like a computer or a procedure that had the right kinds of rules, it could compute all sorts of things. But there were some things it couldn't compute, unsolvable problems, and that became an exciting branch of mathematics. And the star thinker in that field was Alan Turing, who invented a very simple kind of universal general purpose computer. Instead of a random access memory, it just had a tape, which it could write on, and read, and change symbols. And it would go back and forth. And if it's in state x at, say, symbol y,",

And in the 1950s, big companies started to make big computers, which were rooms full of equipment. But as you know, most programs could only do some particular thing, and none of them were very smart. Whereas a human can handle lots of kinds of situations.

My favorite example is I'm thirsty, so I see that glass of water. And I do that and get it. Actually, I am. On the other hand, if I were here, I would never in a whole lifetime do this. You never walk out a window by mistake. We're incredibly reliable, so how do I know how far it is?",

If you assume those are both chairs of the same size, and you know that this chair is about twice as far away as that, although, you don't-- well, and how far away they are pretty much by the absolute size. If you have two eyes that work well, then, if something is less than 30 feet away, you can make a pretty good estimate of its distance by focusing both eyes on some feature. And your brain can tell how far apart your eyes are looking, so there's 12 different things. It's more than you need. Lots of people are missing half of those. Lots of people have very poor vision in one eye. Some people cannot fuse stereo images,",

Because if you're an airplane, and you're less than 30 or 40 feet away from something, it's too-- you could use stereo. But it's too late. Anyway, that's interesting. See if you can think of an example, where a person has even more 12 of these. But it's pretty amazing, isn't it? It's more redundancy. This is too hard to read, but somehow, I found it in Aristotle essay the idea that you should represent things in multiple ways. You might describe a house.

So you see there's two different descriptions. One is the functional description. It's a shelter. The second one is a structural description, how it's made. And Aristotle says, which is the better description? And he dismisses the material one or the functional one is not rather the person who combines both in a single statement. And then I found a paragraph by Fineman, who says, every theoretical physicist who is any good knows six or seven different ways to represent exactly the same physics. And you know that they're all equivalent, but you keep them all in your head hoping that they will give you different ideas for guessing I should put more dots. Anyway, that whole argument is to say",

And in some cases, we even know that there are different parts of the brain that are involved in one aspect or another of constructing those different representations or descriptions. If you look at one of my favorite books, it weighs about 20 pounds. It's the book on the nervous system by Kandel and Schwartz. And the index to that book is quite a lot of pages long, and it mentions 400 different structures in the brain. So the brain is not like the-- well, I shouldn't make fun of the liver. Because for all I know, the liver has 400 different many processes for doing things. But the brain has distinguishable areas that seem to perform several hundred different functions. And with a microscope, at first, they all look pretty much the same. But if you look closely, you see slightly different patterns of how the most layers of the cortex of the brain, most",

And there are lots of differences between the columns in different areas, and we know some of the functions. In most cases, we don't know much about how any of them actually work with the main exception of vision, where the functions of the cells in the visual cortex are fairly well understood at low levels. So we know how that part of the brain finds the edges and boundaries of different areas, and textures, and regions of the visual field.

And how could you put them together into a larger system, which could do things, like learn language, and prove theorems, and convince people to do things that they would never have dreamed of doing five minutes earlier, and stuff like that? Now the first sort of things I was interested in was, in fact, how to simulate simple kinds of nerve cells. Because in the 1950s, there was about almost 100 years, really more like 50 years of science discovering things about neurons and nerve cells, the axons, and dendrites that they use to communicate with other neurons. So if you go back to 1890, you find a few anatomists discovering some of the functions or connections of neurons in the brain.",

And by 1900, it was pretty clear that part of the activity in a nerve cell was chemical and part was electrical. And by 1920 or '30 with the cathode ray tube appearing mostly because of television, but it became possible to do a lot of neurophysiology by sticking needles in brains. The vacuum tube appears around 1900, and you can make amplifiers that can see millivolts and then microvolts. So in the beginning of the 20th century, there was lots of progress. By 1950, we knew a lot about the nervous system, but we still don't know much about how you learn something in the brain. It's quite clear that the things called synapses are involved. The connections between two neurons become better at conducting nerve impulses under some conditions, but no one",

And in particular, there was a theory called k line's, knowledge lines, or something that came partly from me and partly from a couple of other researchers named David Waltz and Jordan Pollock. That's a sort of nice theory of how neural networks might remember higher level concepts. And for some reason, although that kind of work is from around 1980, which is 30 years ago, it has not hit the neuroscience community. So if you look at the emotion machine book or the society minded in Amazon, you might run across a review by a neurologist named Richard Restak, who says that Minsky makes up a lot of concepts, like K-lines, and micronemes, and stuff like that, that nobody's ever heard of. And there's no evidence for them, and he ignores the possibility that it isn't the nerve cells in the brain that are important.",

There wasn't much of a unified theory, until Newton, and he got these three wonderful laws. One was the gravitational idea that bodies attract each other with a force that's the inverse square of the distance between them. Another is that kinetic energy is conserved. I forget with the third one is. Oh, equal reaction is equal and opposite. If two things collide, they transfer equal amount of momentum to both. There was a little problem up to Newton's time. Galileo got some of those ideas, and my impression from reading him is that he has a dim idea that there are two things around. There's kinetic energy, which is MV-- oops, momentum is MV. And there's kinetic energy, which is MV squared,",

Anyway, what's happened in artificial intelligence, like most fields, is that people said, well, let's try to understand thinking and psychology. And let's use physics as our model, so what we want is to get a very small number of universal laws. And a lot of psychologists struggled around to do that, and then they gradually separated.

And Este's got a set of four or five rules, which looked like Newton's laws. And if you designed your experiment very carefully and shielded the animal from noise and everything else, which is what a physicist would do for a physics experiment, the reinforcement theories got some pretty good models of how to make a machine learn. But they weren't good enough. So here's a whole list of things that happened in the early years of cognitive psychology when people were trying to make theories of thinking, and they were imitating the physicists. By physics envy to borrow a term of Freud, the idea is, can you find a few simple rules that will apply to very broad classes of psychological phenomena? And this led to various kinds of projects.",

            "text": " Lots of neural network, and reinforcement, and statistical based methods led to learning machines that were pretty good at learning in some kinds of situations. And they're becoming very popular, but I don't like them. Because, if you have a lot of variables, like 50 or 100, then to use a probabilistic analysis, you have to think of all combinations of those variables. Because if two of them are combined in something, like a exclusive or a manner, you know, I just put the light pen in a pocket. It's either in the left pocket or a right pocket. It can't be both. That's an x or. That will cause a lot of trouble to a learning machine. And if there are a hundreds variables, there's no way you could decide which of the two to the 100th Boolean combinations of those variables you should think about. So lots of statistical learning systems are good for lots of applications. But they just won't cut it to solve hard problems, where the hypothesis is a little bit complicated and has seven or eight variables with complicated interactions.",

Then you can start combining them, and things get better and better. However, mathematically, if an effect you're looking for depends on the exclusive or of several variables, there's no way to approach that by successive approximations. If any one of the variables is missing, there won't be any correlation of the phenomenon with the others. Anyway, that's a long story, but I think it's worth complaining about. Because almost all young people who start working on artificial intelligence look around and say, what's popular? Statistical learning, so I'll do that. That's exactly the way to kill yourself scientifically. You don't want to get the most popular thing. You want to say, what are my really good at that's different? And what are the chances that would provide another thing? End of long speech.",

And when he got to MIT, he was completely blind, but there was a nice big parking lot in technology square. And he would ride a bicycle. And people, like Sussman, and Winston, and whoever was around, would yell at him, telling him where the next obstacle would be. Jim got better and better at that, and nothing would stop him. And he decided he would write a program that-- oh, I wrote a program that would take any formula and find its derivative. It was really easy, because there were just about five rules. Like if there's a product UV, then you compute U times the derivative of V plus V times U of DV plus DVU. So I wrote a 20 line list program that did all the algebraic expressions, and what it would do is put Ds in the right place. And then it would go back through the expression again. Wherever it saw a D, it would do the derivative of the thing after that and nothing to it.",

And in fact, in Providence at the home of the American Mathematical Society, there is a big library called the Bateman Manuscript Project, which has been collecting all known integrals for 100 years. And when anybody finds a new integral that they can integrate in closed form, they send the formulas to the Bateman Manuscript Project, and some hackers there develop ways to index it. So if you had an integral, and you didn't know how to integrate it, you could look it up. And that was pretty big. I should say that Slagle succeeded in writing a program that managed to do all of the kinds of integrals that one usually found on the first year calculus course at MIT and got an A in those. He couldn't do word problems. And the uncanny thing is that, if it was a problem that usually took a MIT student five",

A terrific student, and he set up a project called maxima for project Max Symbolic Algebra and got several people all over the country working on integration.

And Moses mentioned to me he had read Slagle's program thesis. And it took him a couple of weeks to understand the two pages of-- or three pages of-- Lisp that Slagle had written. Because being blind, Slagle had tried to get the thing into as compact a form as possible. But that's symbolic. It's too easy. It was in a more ambitious one, which was, three years later, Dan Bobrow, who is now a vice president doing something at Xerox-- and it solved problems like this.

This was a program where you could talk to a robot that-- I don't have a good picture in this slide. But they're a bunch of blocks of different colors. They're all cubes in the-- or rectangular blocks. And you can say, which is the largest block on top of the big blue block? And it would answer you. And you could say, put the large red block on top of the small green block, and it would do that. And Winograd's program was, of course, a symbolic one. We actually built a robot. And I guess we built it second. Our friends at Stanford built a robot. And they imported Winograd's program. And they had the robot actually performing these operations that you told it to do by typing. And it was pretty exciting. My favorite program in that period",

And Evans wrote a set of rules which were pretty good at this. Did as well as 16-year-olds. And it picks this one. And if you ask it why, it says something like, I don't have a reason. It moves the largest object down or something like that, makes up different reasons. So you see, in some sense, we're going backwards in age. Because we're going from calculus, to algebra, to simple analogies. Oh, there it is. That's one where the largest object moves down. I don't know why I have two of them.

And so there's very little to it. So in some sense, if you look at the-- what you're doing in math in high school, in education, you're going from hard to easy. It's just that people aren't-- most people aren't very good at obeying really simple rules, because it's so hideously boring or something.

And one aspect of commonsense thinking is going right back to that idea of vision having a dozen different systems, is that, whatever a person normally is doing, they are probably representing it in several different ways. And here's an actual scene of two kids named Julie and Henry who are playing with blocks. It's pretty hard to see those blocks. And you can think that Julie is thinking seven thoughts. I'd like to see a longer list. Maybe a good essay would be to take a few examples and say, what are the most common micro-worlds? See physical, social, emotional, mental, instrumental-- whatever that is-- visual, tactile, spatial. She's thinking all these things. What if I pulled out that bottom block? You can't see the tower very well.",

            "text": " that I got this idea from Sigmund Freud's early theories. There's been a lot of Freud bashing recently. You can look on the web. I forget the authors. But there are a couple of books saying that he made up all his data, and there's no evidence that he ever cured anyone, and that he lied about all the data mentioned in his 30 or 40 books, and so forth. AUDIENCE: Also [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: Yes, right. But the funny part is that if you look at his first major book-- 1895-- called The Interpretation of Dreams, it sort of outlines his theory that most of thinking is unconscious, and it's processes you can't get access to. And it has a little bit about sex, but that's not a major feature. And it's just full of great ideas that the cognitive psychologists finally began to get in the 1960s again and never give credit to Freud. So he may well have made up his data. But if you have a very good theory and nobody will listen to you, what can you do?",

Do you think it's because they're just really hard to find, or no-one's actually looking for them?

Any chemical would have the same function as any other one provided there's another receptor that causes something to happen in the cell membrane. So you don't want to regard acetylcholine or epinephrine as having a mental significance. It's just a-- it's just another pulse, but very low-resolution. And yes, a neurochemical might affect all the neurons a little bit, and raise the average amount of activity of some big population of cells, and reduce the average activity of some others. But that's nothing like thinking. That's like saying, in order to understand how a car works-- what's the most insulting thing I could say? Or to understand how a computer works, you have to understand the arsenic, and phosphorus, and/or-- what's the other one? You have to understand these atoms that are-- what? AUDIENCE: Germanium. PROFESSOR: Yeah, well, that's the matrix. So there are these one part in a million impurities. And that's what's important about a computer,",

That's why practically every transistor in a computer is mated to another one in opposite phase to form a flip-flop whose properties are exactly the same, except one in a quadrillion times. In other words, everything chemical about a computer is irrelevant. And I suspect that almost everything chemical about the brain is unimportant except that it causes-- it helps to make the columns in the cortex, which are complicated arrangements of several hundred cells, work reliably. Whereas the neuroscientist is looking for the secret in the sodium. When a neuron fires, the important thing is that that lets the sodium in and the potassium out or vise-versa-- I forget which-- at 500 millivolts-- really quite a colossal event. But it has no significant. It's only when it's attached to a flip-flop, or to something like a K-line, which has an encoder and decoder of a digital sort every few microns of its length",

The chemistry of the neuron firing is very interesting, and complicated, and cute. And in the case of the electric eel, you know what happened there. The neuron synapse, it got rid of the next neuron. And it just-- in the electric eel, you have a bunch of synapses, or motor end plates they're called, in series. So instead of half a volt, if you have 300 of those, you get 150 volts. I think the electric shock that a electric eel can give you is about 300 volts. And this can cause you to drown promptly if you are in the wrong wave when it happens to bump into you. I don't know why I'm rambling this way. You're welcome to study neuroscience. But please try to help them instead of learn from them. [LAUGHTER] Yeah? They just don't know what a K-line is. And that's a paper that's been widely read.

Why don't we just, as computer scientists, program the K-lines and try to [INAUDIBLE]? This is the human mind, and we can reproduce it.

I've never met a neuroscientist who knows the pioneering work of Newell and Simon in the late 1950s. So there's something wrong with that community. They're just ignorant. They're proud of it. Oh, well. I spent some time learning neuroscience when I was-- I once had a great stroke of luck. When I was a-- I guess I was a junior at Harvard. And there was a great new biology building",

So this building was just finished and half occupied, because it was made with a future. So I wandered over there, and I met a professor named John Welsh. And I said, I'd like to learn neurology. And he said, great, well, I have an extra lab. Why don't you-- why don't you study the crayfish claw? I said, great. So he gave me this lab, which had four rooms, and a dark room, and a lot of equipment, and nobody there. And he had worked on crayfish. So there was somebody who went, every week, up to Walden Pond or somewhere, and caught crayfish, and bring them back. And I was a radio amateur hacker at the time. So I was good at electronics. So I got my crayfish. And Welsh showed me how to-- the great thing about this preparation is you can take the crayfish, and if you-- claw-- and if you hold it just right, it goes, snap. It comes off. Grows another one-- takes a couple of years.",

Why don't you take this lab? It was in the Jefferson. Anyway-- yeah? AUDIENCE: I think part of the reason that you don't see experimental neuroscience on things like K-lines is that neurons are long and thin. So if you want to do an experiment to actually measure a real neural network, you have to trace structures with, roughly, maybe tens of nanometer resolution. But you need to trace them over what might be a couple, or even tens, of millimeters to start to-- and you need to do this for thousands and thousands of neurons before you could get to the point of seeing something like a K-line and understanding it. So it's just a massive data acquisition and processing problem. PROFESSOR: Oh, but they're doing that. AUDIENCE: They're starting to try to. PROFESSOR: But they don't have-- they don't know what to look for. Maybe you don't have to do so much. Maybe you just have to do a few sections here and there and say, well, look, there were 400 of these here. Now there's only 200.",

Because it might get down to-- you need to be looking at electron micrographs of brains that are sliced at about 30-millimeter-- sorry, excuse me, 30-nanometer slices. So even just having a single person reconstruct a single neuron takes-- might take weeks. PROFESSOR: Well, I don't know. Maybe a bundle of K-lines is half a millimeter thick. AUDIENCE: Oh, so If you actually do some larger-scale structure to start off looking at, yeah. PROFESSOR: Why not? I just think they have no idea what to look for. I could give you 20 of those in five minutes, but nobody's listening. AUDIENCE: So I guess you need to know what it looks like before you can look for it at that scale. PROFESSOR: What scale? AUDIENCE: I don't know. I mean, they know what neurons look like. So you know-- PROFESSOR: Yeah AUDIENCE: You know what to look for if you're saying a neural net level. PROFESSOR: I'm saying you may only have to look at the white matter. AUDIENCE: Oh, all right. PROFESSOR: Ignore the neurons. Because the point of K-lines is, where do these go? And what goes into them and out? I don't know. It's just this idea, let's map the whole brain, 100 billion things.",

PROFESSOR: The idea is that-- suppose one part of the brain is doing something, and it's in some particular state that's very important, like-- I don't know, that-- like I've just seen a glass of water. Then another part of the brain would like to know there's a glass of water in the environment. And I've been looking for one. So I should try to take over and do something about that. Now at the moment, there is no theory of what happens in different parts of the brain for a simple thing like that to happen, no theory at all, except they use the word \"association.\" Or they talk about, what are the purposeful neurons?",

And when the visual system sees an apple, it turns on 50 of those wires. And when it sees a pear, it turns on a different 100 or 50 of those wires. But about 20 of them are the same, so forth. In other words, it's like the edge of a punched card. Have you ever seen a card-based retrieval system? If you have a book that has-- suppose it's about physics, and biology, and Sumatra. And a typical 5 by 8 card has 80 holes in the top edge. So what do you do is, if it's Sumatra, you punch eight of these holes at random, particular set. They're assigned to Sumatra. And then if it's-- I forget what my first two examples were. But you punch eight or 10 holes for each of the other two words. So now there are 24 punches. Only probably four or five of them are duplicates.",

And now, if something is looking for the cards that have-- were punched for those three things, even if there are 30 or 40 other holes punched in the card, you stick your 20 wires through the whole deck and lift it up. And only cards fall out that had those three categories punched for. So you see, even though you had 80 holes, you could punch combinations of up to a million different categories into that. And if you have to put a bunch of wires through, you'll get all of the ones that were punched for those cate-- the categories you're looking for. And you might get three or four other cards that will come down also. Because all of the eight holes were punched for some category by accident. Do you get the picture? I'll send you a reference. It was invented by a-- in the 19-- early 1940s by a Cambridge scientist here named Calvin Mooers and was widely used in libraries for information retrieval until computers came along.

AUDIENCE: What are your thoughts about the current artificial intelligence research at MIT, such as Winston's genesis project? PROFESSOR: I think Winston is just about one of the best ones in the whole world. I don't know any other projects that are trying to do things on that higher level of commonsense knowledge. He's just lost a lot of funding. So one problem is, how do you support a project like that? Have you followed it? I don't know if there's a recent summary of what they're doing.

They didn't-- they didn't want to hear what we wanted to do. And things have turned the opposite. So what would happen is, every year, we'd say, we did these great things, and we might do some more.

So he got Congress to pass a law that ARPA shouldn't be allowed to support anything that didn't have direct military application. And Congress went for this. And all of a sudden, a lot of research disappeared, basic research. It didn't bother us much. Because we made up applications and said, well, this will make a military robot",

Because-- but anyway, around 1980, the funding for that sort of thing just dried up because of this political accident. It was just an accident that ARPA, mainly through the Office of Naval Research, was funding basic research. And that was a bit of history. If you look back at the year 1900 or so, you see people like Einstein making these nice theories. But Einstein wasn't a very abstract mathematician. So he had a mathematician named Herman Weyl polishing his tensors and things for him. And Herman Weyl's son, Joe, was at the Office of Naval Research in my early time. And that office had spent a lot of secret money getting scientists out of Europe while Hitler was marching",

ARPA changed its name to DARPA. It was Advanced Research Projects Agency. And it had to call itself Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Yeah?

The number of people working on advanced ideas in AI has gotten smaller and smaller as the-- f right now, the-- around 1980, rule-based systems became popular. And there were lots of things to do. Right now, statistical-based inference systems are becoming popular. And as I said, these things are tremendously useful. But the problem is, if you have a statistical system, the important part is guessing what are the plausible hypotheses and then making up the-- then finding out how many instances of that are correlated with such and such. So it's a nice idea. But the hard problem is the abstract, symbolic problem of, what sets of variables are worth considering at all when there are a lot of them?

Lieberman runs a world-class group that's working on commonsense knowledge and informal reasoning. And it seems to me that that's the critical thing that all the other systems will need. In the meantime, there are people working on logical inference, which has the same problem that statistical inference has-- namely, how do you guess which combinations of variables are worth thinking about? Then it seems to me that the statistics isn't so important. In fact, there's a great researcher named Douglas Lenat in Austin, Texas who once made an interesting AI system that was good at making predictions and guessing explanations for things. And it was sort of like a probabilistic system. It had a lot of hypotheses. And every time one of them was useful in solving a problem, it moved it up one on the list. So Lenat's thing never used any numbers. It didn't say, this is successful 0.73 of the time, and now it's successful 0.7364825 of the time.",

Well, if you're doing-- if you're trying to solve the problem, what do you need to know? You want to know, what's the most use-- what's the most likely to be useful one, and try that. You don't care how likely it is to be useful as long as it's the most, right? I mean, if it's one in a million, maybe you should say, I'm getting out of here. I don't-- I shouldn't be working in this field at all, or get a better problem. But Lenat's thing did rather wonderfully at making theories by just changing the ranking of the hypotheses that was considered-- no numbers. It did something very cute. He gave it examples of arithmetic. And it actually-- it was a rather long effort. And it actually learned to do some arithmetic. And it invented the idea of division and the idea of prime number, which was some number that",

So they may-- it may be that-- I don't know the answer. It's interesting. The theory-- the first theory in my paper is that when you have a lot of complicated things happening, then the only way to learn is to represent things that happen, and then look at the differences between things that are similar, and then try to explain the differences, right? I mean, what else is there? Maybe there's something else. So in order to become intelligent and understand things, you have to be able to compare things. And to me, the most important feature of what's called music is that it's divided into measures-- bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bup, bah, bah. And measures are the same number of beats, or whatever they are.",

You changed the eighth notes in the second one, the last four eighth notes-- no, the two before last-- to a quarter note. So you're taking things that were in different times, and you're superimposing those times. And now you can see the difference. And the reason you can see the difference is that you have things called measures. And the measures have things called beats. And so things get locked into very good frames. Now there's some Indian music which has 14 measures for a phrase. And some of the measures go seven and five. And I can make no sense of that stuff whatever. And I've tried fairly hard, but not very. So I don't understand how Indians can think. Any of you can handle Indian music? AUDIENCE: I guess, just to add on what you said about this, my favorite quote from your paper on music, mind, and meaning is the one about what good is music, about how kids play with blocks to learn about space, and people play with music to learn about time.",

And maybe the reviewer says, and after the second and third movement, he finally returns to the initial key of E flat major-- what a relief. Well, I once had absolute pitch for a couple of weeks, because I ran a tuning fork in my room for a month. And I didn't like it. [LAUGHTER]",

If you ever find one, I'd like to see it. Because if you go to a big library, there are thousands of books about music. And if you open one, it's mostly Berlioz complaining that somebody wouldn't give him enough money to hire a big enough chorus. But I've found very few books about music itself. Yes? AUDIENCE: It's not about music anymore. Is that all right? OK. Do you think that having a body is a necessary component of having a mind? Could you do just as well just as a-- you know, sort of a simulated creature? PROFESSOR: Oh, sure, you could-- AUDIENCE: And have all the things? PROFESSOR: Simulation-- I think a mind that's not in a world wouldn't have much to do. It would have to invent the world. And I don't see why it couldn't. But you might have to give it a start, like the idea of three or four dimensions.",

Because this is just a possible world. Suppose there are a whole lot of possible worlds, and there's one real one. How could you ever-- how could you possibly know which one you're in?

It's all right to say this bottle exists, because that's saying this bottle is in this universe. But what would it mean to say the universe exists? The universe is in the universe? So there's something wrong with thinking about-- so there are only possible worlds. There's no-- it doesn't make any sense to pick one of them out and say that's the real one. Yeah? AUDIENCE: So it's existence is relative? PROFESSOR: Yeah, you don't say, this is the world I'm in. But you shouldn't say-- that doesn't mean it exists. Like, 2 is in the set of even numbers. But what's the set of even numbers in? It doesn't stop anywhere. Yeah? Lots of worlds. AUDIENCE: So is mathematics [INAUDIBLE] worlds. But physics, it only explains the current world? Or I don't know how you compare these two subjects. PROFESSOR: Well, you can't tell. Because five minutes from now, everything might change. So nothing ever explains anything. You just have to take what you've got and make the best of it.",

But it respected Carnegie, and it made a little stash, secret stash, of AIBOs to send to Carnegie when the present ones break. But my impression of AI projects that have robots is that they do less, less, less than projects that don't. The reason is, if you have a robot like ASIMO, made by Sony? No. AUDIENCE: Honda. PROFESSOR: Honda. ASIMO can get in the back seat of a car with some effort, and usually falls over. However, if you simulate a stick figure in a computer getting into a stick figure of a car, then you can make it learn to do that and get better and better. And so all AI projects without robots are way ahead of all AI projects with robots. And the profound reason is that robots are usually expensive, and they're always being fixed. So if you have five students, and the robot is being fixed--",

Whereas if you have a stick figure robot, then you can just run it on this, although it might be a little slower than your mainframe-- probably not. Yeah? AUDIENCE: So then back to the idea of the mind and the body, here's a theory that I just thought of-- the idea of the body as a seeming abstract, basically a mechanism for input-output. It's a set of sensors from which our brains can get information about the world, and instead of actuators, in which we can display our state. So in that light, it's almost as if our brains are really independent on our body itself. It can adapt to any sort of body if we happen to hook it up that way. And it just so happens that we've been hooked up to this body since birth, that we have such good mental models of how to use this body. And I guess an example of-- from experiments that support this theory might be how, when people have limbs amputated, it takes them a while to forget that they have the limb. Because their mental model still exists. The mental models don't go away overnight. And also, I guess, they train monkeys to control robot arms",

The idea is that maybe-- in the older theories of psychology, everything is learned by experience in the real world-- so conditioning, and reinforcement, and so forth. In this theory I call internal grounding, I make a conjecture. Suppose the brain has a little piece of nerve tissue which consists of a few neurons arranged to make not a flip-flop, but a-- what would you call a three- or four-flop, a flip-flop with three or four states? Let's say three. So when you put a certain input, it goes from-- couldn't find the chalk. So here are three states. And here's a certain input that means if you're in that state, you go to this. And if you pop that input again, it does this. And if you, say, go counterclockwise, it goes.",

So this would be-- that means that's equivalent to just going one. Get the idea? In other words, imagine that there's a little world inside your brain, which is very small and only has three states. And you have actions that you can perform on it. And you have an inner eye which can see which of the three points of that triangle you're on. Then you could learn, by experience, that if you go left, left, left, you're back where you were. But if you go left, right, left, right, you're back where you are. And if you go left, left, right, that's like going one left. In other words, you could imagine a brain that starts out-- before it connects itself to the real world, it starts by having the top level of the brain connected to a little internal world which just has three or four states. And you get very good at manipulating that. You add more sensory systems to the outer world. And you get to get-- learn ways to get around in the real world. So I call that the internal grounding hypothesis.",

You understand? The more abstract an idea is, the simpler, and more stupid, and elementary it is. Abstract doesn't mean hard. Abstract means stupid. Real things like this are infinitely complicated. So we might have-- and I wouldn't dare suggest this to a neuroscientist. There might be some little brain center somewhere near the frontal cortex that allows the frontal cortex to do some predicting, and planning, and induction about a very simple-- a few simple, finite-state arrangements. Who knows? Would you look for it? Well, if you were a neuroscientist, you could say, oh, that's completely different from anything I ever heard. Let's look for it.

            "text": " And it corrupted AI research in Japan for several years. I can't understand-- Brooks became popular because he said, maybe the important things about thinking is that there's no internal representation. You're just reacting to situations. And you have a big library of how to react to each situation. Well, David Hume had that idea. And he was a popular philosopher for hundreds of years. But it went nowhere, and it's gone, and so is Rod. However, he is one of the great robot designers. And he may be instrumental in fixing the great Japanese nuclear meltdown. Because they're shipping some of his robots out there. The problem is, can it open the door? So far, no robot can open the door even though it's not locked. [APPLAUSE] Thank you.",
