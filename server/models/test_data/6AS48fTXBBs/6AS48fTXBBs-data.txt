But I thought I'd say a few things about chapter 1, and then see if there are any questions. I can't see the pointer. Oh, anybody remember how to get Word to [CHUCKLES] make its pointer not disappear? Maybe I mentioned this the first lecture, but I was taken by this cute poem by Dorothy Parker because the first chapter was about love and stuff like that. So I tried to get the rights to reproduce it, and it turned out that she was angry at all her friends. She must have been a perpetually pissed-off person.",

And philosophers talk about it and existentialists, and so on. So there are lots of problems about our ideas about ourselves. And in reading around for half my life,",

So if you look at, in particular, Aristotle's-- there are a number of books and one of them is called Rhetoric. And it's full of theories about how people reason and influence each other. And I'll show you some quotes from that because when I look at the history that I've encountered about psychology, sort of Aristotle stands out as being the first and among the best. And as far as I can see, there were no psychologists nearly as good as him. Of course, we don't know whether there was a him exactly because he-- what we have of Aristotle is a lot of writing, but it's all cobbled together by students from all sorts of manuscripts by other people, and people who took notes. And Aristotle claims to have learned a lot from Plato. Well, we have very little writing from him.",

And then a couple of thousand years later, you start to find people like Spinoza and Kant and John Locke and David Hume, who start to make psychology theories, very little of which is as good as the ones that Aristotle has in all his fragments. So one question that frequently bothers me, and it should bother everyone, is why did science disappear for 1,000 years? And the standard explanation is the rise of the great religions. And why did it come back? And you see with the first signs of anything like modern science, at least in my view, with Galileo and Newton-- there a couple of people before that. There's some people in the Muslim world who invented some high school algebra, and they make a big fuss about that. It looks like Archimedes, in a very recently discovered manuscript, computed an integral.",

Because there isn't much psychology in the modern sense until 1900, or the late 1800s, with Francis Galton and William James lived around here. And Rudolph Fleiss, who-- Sigmund Freud starts writing in 1895. People make fun of Freud, as I mentioned last week. But in fact, among other things-- how many of you have read the recent criticisms of Freud, which claim that he was a complete faker and never cured a single patient? This is popular stuff. I don't believe Freud ever really claimed to cure a single patient. So the critics, who are really very ferocious, claimed that he made up all his data, and so forth. But most of what Freud says, is that psychoanalysis might be a good way to find out what you're really thinking, and discover more about yourself and your goals, and so forth.",

I don't feel like reading aloud. But there's lots of discussion of emotions, and how mysterious and complex they are. And then the marvelous thing is how many words there are for emotional states. I think I got 300, but I don't remember. Anyway, here's from A to D, and I don't recall how I found those. But I think that's a lot. How many words for ways to think are there? Now that's a serious question because I complained, maybe, on the next page. No, I didn't. I found myself complaining that there were very few words for ways to think. And then this afternoon when I was pruning these slides, it occurred to me that I didn't really try.",

And in some sense, presumably, they're studying the psychology of animals because just as with the person, when somebody flies into a rage, you're not describing their mental state. You're describing something about how they behave. And so the ethologists, too, are psychologists. And Tinbergen and Lorenz, starting around 1920s, started to analyze the behavior of animals in great detail. And so here's an example of how a certain fish behaves. I actually forgot which fish it is, but there's a picture of it some-- in the book. And at different points in its life, it's in different phases. And this is just one diagram of a dozen for this particular fish and its reproduction, which involves an environment with plants and other things. And he divides its behavior into parenting, courtship, nesting, and fighting. And then, you see each of those as a lot of subdivisions.",

Tinbergen also spent years on some beach watching seagulls, and so he has a diagram like this for a particular class of seagulls. When I came to Boston, my friends and I used to go to Nahant and look at the tide pools there, where there are a lot of activities, and it was very interesting. And I got a big fish tank and imported all sorts of little animals and plants from the tide pools in Nahant. And I watched them for about a year and didn't learn anything. AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS] MARVIN MINSKY: And that was before I read Tinbergen. And then I realized there's something about those people, which is they could watch a fish and recognize all sorts of behaviors. And I would just watch a fish and wonder whether it was hungry, or-- what? Wouldn't you get bored swimming back and forth for three years in a--",

And you've probably all heard of Pavlov or Watson. And what happened is, around 1900, some psychologists said, well, these Galtons and Freuds and William James are very poetic and expressive and literary, and they write much better than we do and tells good stories. But they're not scientists and they don't do reproducible experiments. So what we have to do is simplify the situation to find the basic laws of behavior.

And the animal would push one of two levers and one of them would make the stimulus even more annoying and one of them would make it go away. And you'd plot curves of how often the animal pressed these levers so you would get a quantitative theory of how much he learned and how much it could remember, and how many trials it would have to do. And then instead of just looking at reactions to stimuli, they quickly switched to trying to teach the animal things by giving it to two alternatives-- turn left or turn right, or push this button or that, or whatever. And if they pushed the one you approve of, then you'd give them a little pellet of food. And there was a lot of engineering so that you would make sure that the food got to them right away. Because if there were a 10-second delay between an action and a reward, the pigeon or a squirrel or rat or cat or dog would learn much less quickly than if there was a one-second delay. And anyway, that went on for 50 years,",

            "text": " starting around 1900, Pavlov and his dogs. And there's a great movie that some guy came around with that had been taken of Pavlov's lab, and it shows him sort of like a great dictator, or something. There's this room with lot of cages and dogs, and mostly dogs, in this case. And Pavlov comes in and there are a bunch of lackeys who sort of bow and scrape because he's a lord. And he comes in, and all the dogs run into the corner of their cages and yelp. So the Pavlovians tried pretty hard to get that movie suppressed. And I haven't seen it in recent years. But anyway, Fred Skinner, who was a professor when I was an undergraduate at Harvard, was the first one to really automate this experimental psychology, and he invented what's called a Skinner box. But it's just a soundproof, light-proof, well-ventilated and thermally-regulated cage. And you can put a rat or a pigeon-- those are the most common animals. They're very inexpensive because they're free.",

But there's an interesting mystery-- I forget which whales, but some whales have a 20-minute song, and they repeat it for a whole season. And next year, that song is a little bit different. But it goes, essentially, without repeating-- it's very complicated-- for 20 minutes. And people have studied that a lot and no one has the slightest idea of what it means. And nobody even has any good conjectures, which bothers me. But I think it probably means is this, when there's a whole bunch of fish somewhere for one of these whales, it might be 200 miles away, and it's very-- whales eat a lot. And it's very important to find where the fish are. And I believe this message, which",

And if there's a sequence of events, then animals remember a lot about the first few and the last few in the sequence. They don't remember much about the middle. And of course, the reliability of their memory depends a lot on how recent it was and on how powerful the reward was, and blah, blah. And so they get these little sets of rules that look like Newton's laws, and that was the kind of sort of psychological physics that the so-called behaviorists were mostly looking for. This was not what Tinbergen and Lorenz did because they wrote books with extensive descriptions of what the animals did and made little diagrammatic guesses about the structure of the subroutines and sub-structures. Anyway, end of history, but it's a nice question-- why do some sciences grow, and why was psychology just about the last one? I suspect it could have been earlier, but people tried to imitate the physicists and tried to say, maybe there's something like Newton's or Maxwell's laws",

When Seymour Papert and I started thinking about these things, which was really around 1960, I had been working on some ideas about AI in the late 50s. And my PhD thesis was a theory of neural networks, which was sort of interesting, but never really went anywhere. I went to a meeting in London somewhere and gave a talk about a theory of learning that was based on some neural network ideas. And there was this person from South Africa named Seymour Papert who gave the same paper. And I hope this happens to you someday. Find somebody who thinks so much like you, only different enough that it's worth it. And that you only have to say about three words a day, and some whole new thing starts.

And it finally gelled into the idea that, well, if you look at the brain, you know that there are several different brain centers. What's all that stuff for, and how could it possibly make any sense to try to explain what it does in terms of four laws like Newton? Like, how does a car work? Is there a magical force inside the engine that causes the wheels to turn? No. There's this funny thing in the back to cause a differential so that if the car isn't going in a straight line, the two wheels going at different speeds won't rip the-- if the two wheels were going at the same speed, the tread would come off in 5 minutes. You ever wonder what a differential is for? Well. So most of the car is fixing bugs in the other parts. That's most of the brain is because we started out as fish,",

If you look at the anatomy of the brain, you know that people label regions, so it's very clear that this occipital lobe back here is largely concerned with vision. But I forget where the one for hearing is. If you destroy the part of the brain for hearing in some animals, you get a little bit of increased function in some part of the visual system that seems to enable the animal to hear a little bit and make some reactions. And there's a whole lot of hype-- I think you have to call it-- about the flexibility of the nervous system. That is, if certain brain areas get destroyed, other parts take over. They almost never are as good. And mostly, many functions never get taken over at all, but are replaced by ones that superficially seem similar. And so there's a whole lot of, I guess,",

But if you do some arithmetic, you get an interesting result. Suppose that each function in the brain occurred in 10 different places at random. Then, if you removed half the brain, how many functions would you lose? Well, almost no arithmetic tells you you would lose about one part in the 1,000. And so, in fact, you would never be able to detect it. So this idea that the brain has enormous redundancy-- well, now change that number to five. Suppose each function is somewhat supported in five different parts of the brain. Then if you take off half the brain, then-- what am I saying? One part in 32 chance of losing some significant function, so probably lots of things that we do are supported in several parts of the brain. Apparently, the language center is pretty unique, and some others. But be careful about the conclusions you",

And I kept working on the society of mind theory, and we didn't work together so much. But we still did plenty of criticizing and supporting of each other.

And I sort of laugh quietly and say, these people are trying to find a physics-like unified minimal theory of psychology. And they're probably right, in one sense. But if they do that, they'll get stuck. Because if you get a new idea, there'll be no place to put it. So if you have something that's very mysterious, don't imitate the physicists. Because if you make a theory that's exactly right and just accounts for the data, and there's nothing extra and nothing loose, then",

So anyway, it's very important, for social reasons, to have a word for whether an action was deliberately violating the rules, as opposed to accidentally violating the rules. Like if you tripped on the stairs and landed on somebody and broke their neck, that's not a crime unless you were so clever as to make it appear that it was an accident, and probably-- anyway, you see what I mean. So we need a-- our whole system of fairness and ethics and social responsibility is based on the distinction between whether an action was deliberate or not. And so, did he do that consciously-- is a word for that. And somehow, the idea of conscious became elevated. Well, that's a very superficial-- you can probably think of 10 other reasons why a word like that-- yes? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] in terms of your writing, I-- it seems to be that there is both sides of the argument, both sides of it. But [INAUDIBLE] it seems [INAUDIBLE] in that-- I can well imagine is lack of representation. You have representation of self and representation",

The idea of free will is completely obscene, isn't it? What could it possibly mean if you did something for no reason? So it's a thoroughly empty idea, isn't it? Or what do you mean by it? Do you mean there's nobody ordering you around, so you're free to do whatever you want? But of course, you're not. You can only do what your computer computes you to do. AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS] AUDIENCE: So in a sense, in the same way that you draw the-- you showed the fish diagram, right? The fish's actions are a product of the environment in its current state, and it's essentially a Turing machine-- MARVIN MINSKY: Well, it's some kind of machine, yes, sure. AUDIENCE: And so, would you argue that we are also Turing machines that are just running out in the world and-- MARVIN MINSKY: Sure. I've never heard of any even interesting alternative. In other words, people who insist on free will appear to me to be like people who believe that there must be a god who created the world. What's the next step? Who created the god? They don't take that step. So if your will is free, OK, then who is controlling it?",

MARVIN MINSKY: That's a great question. And it'd be interesting to think about ways to investigate it. People or researchers are often, in fact, raising that question of do animals have a representation of themself? And there's a famous experiment, but I can't remember what its current status is, where you put a red dot on a chimpanzee's head. And when the chimp passes a mirror and sees that, the chimp might go like that. Whereas I don't think a dog, when it passes a mirror, would rub its forehead to see if it has a red spot. I had a cat who walked past mirrors, because we have some full-sized mirrors around the house. And the cat walks by, and there's this other cat in the mirror, and she pays no attention to it whatever. So of course, I don't know what happened the first three times",

            "text": " of feeling. So it just occurred to me that it seems like if you go back to the list of feelings, it seems like when we talk about feeling, we're talking about a state that the brain is in. So it might be a complicated state that's like some combination of a lot of different parameters. But it's a state that you can stay in for like an arbitrary amount of time. But I think thinking is something that's more sequential, as in like when you're thinking, you're necessarily changing the state of your brain all the time because you're moving bits around. So I don't know. I just thought of this. MARVIN MINSKY: No, I think that's right. That I think when we talk about intelligent behavior, you're absolutely right. What you've got is a process that's criticizing itself and seeing when you got stuck and finding things to do. And I suppose in each emotional state, you're certainly also thinking. So that's going on, but maybe it's more restricted. Like if you're confronting somebody, and there's a sort of conflict, then almost all your thoughts are constrained to that subject. And it's not as resourceful. But I'm just improvising. AUDIENCE: Or if you have for each emotional state, when we say that we're in an emotional state, does it mean that we're talking about",

But perhaps the state itself influences the type of thoughts that you're likely to have. MARVIN MINSKY: OK. I think what I'm talking about in this context is sort of extreme forms, where the person changes into another machine. Like, an angry person won't listen to reason, or it's very hard to deflect them, and so it's this kind of rigid thing. But humans are generally-- are rarely in such extreme states, where nothing gets through. But the whole point of that was that-- I just realize that I maybe was just too lazy-- that we have this huge vocabulary of nuances of emotional activity. Also, people think that these are hard to explain and mysterious and non-physical and blah, blah, blah. But why don't we wait until next week and see if somebody comes up with-- or see if we can come up with a set of 30 or 40 words about intellectual states?",

But why do [INAUDIBLE]---- humans keep changing their environment. AUDIENCE: So for example, yeah, so he uses this example of tossing a coin. The guy says that this coin is unfair. He doesn't say the probabilities. But there is 75% of getting heads, and 25% of getting tails. And we-- like the subjects-- they choose randomly 25% of the time the tails, even though they can take a count of the number of the times that you put heads. And even though if you choose always heads, you will get more money or whatever, you would make it the right decision. MARVIN MINSKY: That's called probability matching,",

It turns out that the best thing to-- what do you think is the optimal strategy? AUDIENCE: Always choose-- MARVIN MINSKY: No. The optimal strategy turns out it's the square roots of the probabilities normalized to add up to 1. And I'll give you a proof next time. This theorem is due to Ray Solomonoff, who invented inductive probability theory. AUDIENCE: But evolution-- MARVIN MINSKY: So evolution, if evolution did probability matching, then it would be wrong. And I bet you'll find out that those experiments are wrong. You have to see how did he rig the experiment so that people, if it's probability 25%, they guess that 25%? AUDIENCE: They made the experiments with [? goldfish. ?] MARVIN MINSKY: I don't know. There was a theory about why you would expect it. It's a good question. I don't think people use probabilities, though. So even if an experiment shows some, I would look for a flaw in the design of the experiment.",

And my understanding is that like for someone who has this distinct personality, they might have a predisposition to feel a certain emotion of like anger, depression, or whatnot. My question is that if you had any insight or theories on to what extent our personality is affected by events or influences that happen to us over the course of a lifetime. And to what extent is it impacted by chemical or biological makeup of our brain? MARVIN MINSKY: Well, you're asking what do people learn? We don't care if it's chemical or-- see, if it's chemical, it's still physical. AUDIENCE: I've read a little bit about treatments for depression. And the argument is that a lot of the reasons for depression is because of some sort of chemical and biological way our brain is constructed. MARVIN MINSKY: Well, there's lots of complicated things about the brain. One feature of the brain, that I don't know if everybody-- you know that there are inhibitory and excitatory synapses.",

            "text": " When one neuron connects to another, the impulse that goes along the axon to the target neuron may reduce the probability or the strength of its firing or increase it. So that's called inhibiting or-- there's no-- or exciting. That's not quite the right word, is it? Now, generally in the nervous system, as a rule, but not always, if you follow a chain of activity, it goes inhibiting, exciting, inhibiting, exciting. If you have too many excitatory things, and there was a loop, then it would explode. And it would wear itself out in jig time. So there is this general feature of the anatomy that you alternate. So when somebody talks about a drug having an inhibitory effect, that's sort of weird because it's inhibiting half the neurons. And therefore, it's lowering the thresholds of the ones they're connected to and so on. I think the best thing is until you have a diagram of the functional relations between different brain centers, it might be best not to try to make generalizations about how the chemistry works.",

MARVIN MINSKY: Cardano knew how to take cube roots, and he wouldn't tell anyone. AUDIENCE: Well, the classic stupid example is baby tongs, which for 300 years made a single Italian family very rich.

AUDIENCE: And that was enough to build a family fortune, until some servant finally spilled the beans, and that was the the end of that. MARVIN MINSKY: Yeah, wow. So who has a theory of the Middle Ages? Is there a standard theory? Yes?

            "text": " as going back to the Classical Age of scholarship of ancient Greece and Rome and as being better than their predecessors for the last few years. And this mostly happened because of the discovery of manuscripts that were translated from the ancient Greek, and in certain cases Latin, by Muslims, who at the time were receding from Europe. So the entire concept of the Middle Ages might be a fabrication of the Renaissance. There were some significant discoveries at the time. MARVIN MINSKY: That's a nice idea. In other words, when was St. Patrick? AUDIENCE: St. Patrick? MARVIN MINSKY: I'm told that he popularized a lot of technical manuscripts-- brought them back into Europe. He has two achievements. One was bringing scientific culture back, and the other was getting snakes out of England or something-- Ireland. I don't know which he was sainted for. Don't you have to do three miracles, or is it-- what's? Yeah? AUDIENCE: Yeah, my theory is the Middle Ages ended around 2100. So I guess I'll say after the Middle Ages end, they'll say, you know, those guys back in the 21st century, they had no idea how thinking worked. They couldn't even think of a few ways to think.",

But it had this section saying-- it mentioned the Newell-Simon-- there was a thing called General Problem Solver, which I mention a couple of times in the book. And it's the idea that the way to solve a problem is to find-- it's a symbolic servo-- find the difference between what you have and what you want. And look in your memory for something that can reduce that difference. Keep doing that. And, of course, it's important to pay attention to the more important differences first and so forth. And I'll send you this article. This article is saying that they made a terrible mistake, and this was a trivial theory. And that's why nobody uses it anymore. And it was interesting how many AI people fell for that idea in the 1960s. My complaint has been that if you look in a modern textbook on-- you must have some in your first volume, Pat. Didn't you have some GPS things? AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah [INAUDIBLE]",

And then finally, when they're a little older, they think in ALGOL or something. But when they switch from machine language to Fortran, then they can't remember their earlier thoughts. And there's almost no evidence of people finding genuine recollections from two-year-olds at later ages. Now, almost everybody thinks they remember something, but there's the problem that you might have rehearsed it and translated it into the Fortran and the ALGOL and the Lisp and the Logo-- whatever it is. One of my greatest influences was a great mathematician named Andrew Gleason at Harvard, who I met practically the first day I got to Harvard. And he would always talk about things I didn't understand. And I would go home and look them up and try to. Anyway, one day, we were talking about number forms.",

And the phenomenon is if I ask you close your eyes and tell me where is the number three, how many of you have a place for the number three? Well, that's a few. And so typically, if you imagine the visual field, that's a windshield, I guess. So there are these numbers in there. They're nowhere in particular, except that it's usually like that for an older child. So here are these numbers. And what's more, in some people, they're colored. So I was talking to Andrew. I had read this Galton paper, which was 1890 or 1885 or something. And so I was asking people if they had number forms.",

Maybe the composite numbers were. Something was bright, and they were colored. So I wrote this down. And over the next couple of years, I would look in antiques stores for old children's blocks. And I found a set of blocks that matched that. And Andrew Gleason said that he knows when he acquired this thing, and it was about four years old. And he had a window in his house. And there was a hill. And he could just see over the sill, and he imagined these numbers on the side of that hill-- blah, blah, blah. Anyway, people who don't have a number form don't know what I'm talking about. And I don't know if the 30% is still true. But it's an interesting phenomenon.",

Yes, there was some high school in Romania that not only produced von Neumann, but about five or six other world-class mathematicians. I don't remember the details. So that's a nice question. If there are these great memes, how come there aren't more big pockets of them? But there are a lot of cultures which were very inventive in other than intellectual fields. How come Paris got all those artists? And how many of you saw the Woody Allen movie? What's it called? Paris at Midnight? It's so funny. AUDIENCE: Like, would we be able to think of one-- say, one idea that would improve? Your improvements are popular. MARVIN MINSKY: Right. That's a good question for each of us. What's your very best idea? And stop fussing with the other ones, and get that one out.",

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] MARVIN MINSKY: Yeah. So there's these two guys around the Media Lab wearing various things on their head. And they're always typing. And you ask them a question, and they've searched Google. And when was that? 1990? AUDIENCE: 1995 I think was when Steve Mann was here. MARVIN MINSKY: But it's all gone. And nobody walks around with direct connection to the web. AUDIENCE: Well, Steve Mann still does. MARVIN MINSKY: Yes. Anyway, I certainly expected it to turn up-- something worn. So anyway, you should be able to buy one, one of these days. And what's her name? Who was that nice woman who had the EEG thing? Do you remember at TED? Forgot her name. Anyway, she had this sort of helmet, which had about 20 electrodes. And she induced me to put it on.",

Somehow, they start to like same foods or use the same words, or there's odd things like that. AUDIENCE: Marrying the same spouses. MARVIN MINSKY: I read a science fiction novel by Robert Sawyer. Any of you know of him? A Canadian writer. And it has to do with somebody who has a fatal disease, so he's going to die soon. But the technology is around where you can make a duplicate of him. And so he has a duplicate made.",

I don't remember. So he wants to come back. And the question is, who gets the car? So I can't remember the title of the novel, except that it has \"alien\" in it. Alienable Rights is not-- something like that. But I wrote an article called \"Alienable Rights.\" So are you the same as you were five minutes ago or five years ago or whatever?

So the joke of that novel is that who owns the car is what matters to decide who is the real original and who is the copy. Frederik Pohl wrote a similar story much longer ago, where people are copied. And the copy is sent on a one-way trip to some planet to fix a broken reactor, and they always die. And you get a million dollars for providing this copy. But one of the copies survived, so it's the same plot. I can't remember the-- if you're looking for a good idea, if you go to 1950s science fiction, look for A.E. van Vogt or Frederik Pohl or all those wonderful writers. That was before it was necessary to describe really good characters. And science fiction got better and better for the literary critics and generally worse and worse",

And if any of them voted for the other party's candidate, there would be hell to pay. But it was a great idea because the Founding Fathers realized that if you had instant feedback, which is what Hitler got, then you could say something really exciting, and everybody would press the \"yes\" button,",

The psychologists now have disappeared into the tar pit of statistics. And they don't have the idea that knowledge needs complicated representations. And I don't care whether you assign probabilities to them or put them in the order of what you thought of them or do what Doug Lenat did in his thesis of swapping things when one worked better than another. But I forget the question. But I think we've got to get better ideas about representation of knowledge. And I don't know where they're going to come from now that the whole AI community is drifting into these ways of avoiding representations. I haven't read the Norvig-Russell book. Can anybody summarize what it says about knowledge representation? Who's read it? AUDIENCE: Well, there's a chapter",
