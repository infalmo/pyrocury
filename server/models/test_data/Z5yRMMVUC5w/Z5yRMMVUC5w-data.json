Today we're going to continue the discussion on Ito calculus. I briefly introduced you to Ito's lemma last time, but let's begin by reviewing it and stating it in a slightly more general form. Last time what we did was we did the quadratic variation of Brownian motion, Brownian process. We defined the Brownian process, Brownian motion, and then showed that it has quadratic variation, which can be written in this form-- dB square is equal to dt. And then we used that to show the simple form of Ito's lemma,",

This additional term was a characteristic of Ito calculus. In classical calculus we only have this term, but we have this additional term. And if you remember, this happened exactly because of this quadratic variation. Let's review it, and let's do it in a slightly more general form. As you know, we have a function f depending on two variables, t and x. Now we're interested in-- we want to evaluate our information on the function f(t, B_t). The second coordinate, we're planning to put in the Brownian motion there. Then again, let's do the same analysis. Can we describe d of f in terms of these differentiations? To do that, deflect this, let me start from Taylor expansion.",

We want to look at the difference of f when we change the first variable a little bit and the second variable a little bit. We start from f of t of x. In the first-order terms, you take the partial derivative, so take del f over del t, and then multiply by the t difference. Second term, you take the partial derivative with respect to the second variable-- partial f over partial x-- and then multiply by del x. That much is enough for classical calculus. But then, as we have seen before, we ought to look at the second-order term. So let's first write down what it is. That's exactly what happened in Taylor expansion, if you remember. If you don't remember, just believe me. This 1 over 2 times, take the second derivatives, partial. Let's write it in terms of-- yes? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah, you're right. Thank you. Is it good now? Let's write it as dt, all these deltas. I'll just write like that. I'll just not write down t and x.",

If you rearrange it, what we get is partial f over partial t plus 1/2 this plus-- and that's the additional term. If you ask me why these terms are not important and this term is important, I can't really say it rigorously. But if you think about dB_t square equals dt, then d times B_t is kind of like square root of dt. It's not a good notation, but if you do that-- these two terms are significantly smaller than dt because you're taking a power of it. dt square becomes a lot smaller than dt, dt to the 3/2 is a lot smaller than dt. But this one survives because it's equal to dt here. That's just the high-level description.",

Just remember, from the classical calculus term, we're only adding this one term there. Yes? AUDIENCE: Why do we have x there? PROFESSOR: Because the second variable is supposed to be x. I don't want to write down partial derivative with respect to a Brownian motion here because it doesn't look good. It just means, take the partial derivative with respect to the second term. So just view this as a function f of t of x,",

Consider a stochastic process X of t such that d of X is equal to mu times d of t plus sigma times d of B_t. This is almost like a Brownian motion, but you have this additional term. This is called a drift term. Basically, this happens if X_t is equal to mu*t plus sigma of B_t. Mu and sigma are constants.",

Now I'll show you why this form deviates from this form when we replace B to an X. Remember here all other terms didn't matter, that the only term that mattered was partial square of f... of dx square. To prove this, note that df is partial f over partial t dt plus partial f over partial x d of X_t plus 1/2 of d of x squared. Just exactly the same, but I've replaced the dB-- previously, what we had dB, I'm replacing to dX. Now what changes is dX_t can be written like that. If you just plug it in, what you get here",

But in reality, what it's really doing is just take this Taylor expansion. Remember these two classical terms, and remember that there's one more term here. You can derive it if you want to. Really try to know where it all comes from. It all started from this one fact, quadratic variation, because that made some of the second derivative survive, and because of those, you get these kind of complicated terms. Questions?

Partial f over partial x is equal to 2x, and the second derivative equal to 2 at t, x. Now we just plug in t comma B_t, and what you have is mu equals 0, sigma equals 1, if you want to write it in this formula. What you're going to have is 2 times B_t of dB_t plus 1 over 2 times 2dt. If you write it down. You can either use these parameters and just plug in each of them to figure it out. Or a different way to do it is really write down, remember the proof. This is partial f over partial t dt plus partial f over partial x dx plus 1/2-- remember this one. And x is dB_t here.",

Partial f over partial x is sigma times e to the mu t plus dx, and then dB_t plus-- if you take the second derivative, you do that again, what you get is 1/2, and then sigma square times e to the mu t plus dx, dt. Yes? AUDIENCE: In the original equation that you just wrote, isn't it 1/2 times sigma squared, and then the second derivative? Up there. PROFESSOR: Here? AUDIENCE: Yes. PROFESSOR: 1/2? AUDIENCE: Times sigma squared. PROFESSOR: Oh, sigma-- OK, that's a good question. But that sigma is different. That's if you plug in X_t here. If you plug in X_t where X_t is equal to mu prime dt plus sigma prime d of B_t, then that sigma prime will become a sigma prime square here.",

AUDIENCE: Yeah, that makes a lot more sense. PROFESSOR: If you replace a and b, but I already wrote down all mu's and sigma's. That's a good point, actually. But that's when you want to consider a general stochastic process here other than Brownian motion. But here it's just a Brownian motion, so it's the most simple form. And that's what you get. Mu plus 1/2 sigma square-- and these are just all f itself. That's the good thing about exponential. f times dt plus sigma times d of B_t. Make sense? And there's a reason I was covering this example. It's because-- let's come back to this question. You want to model stock price using Brownian motion, Brownian",

The question was, is S_t equal to e to the sigma times B of t in this case? And I already told you last time that no, it's not true. We can now see why it's not true. Take this function, S_t equals e to the sigma B_t, that's exactly where mu is equal to 0 here. What we got here was d of S_t, in this case, is equal to-- mu is 0, so we get 1/2 of sigma square times dt plus sigma times d of B_t.

Our guess was to take e to the sigma B_t, but it turns out that in this case we have a drift, if you just take natural e to the sigma of B_t. To remove that drift, what you can do is subtract that term somehow. If you can get rid of that term then you can see, if you add this mu to be minus 1 over 2 sigma square, you can remove that term. That's why it doesn't work. So instead use S of t equals e to the minus 1 over 2 sigma square t plus sigma of B_t. That's the geometric Brownian motion without drift. And the reason it has no drift is because of that. If you actually do the computation, the dt term disappears. Question?",

Could you also describe what it means? What does it mean, this solution of B_t? Does that mean if we have a sample path B_t, then we could get a sample path for S_t? PROFESSOR: Oh, what this means, yes. Whenever you have the B_t value, just at each time take the exponential value. Because-- why we want to express this in terms of a Brownian motion is, for Brownian motion we have a pretty good understanding. It's a really good process you understand fairly well, and you have good control on it. But the problem is you want to have a process whose percentile difference behaves like a Brownian motion. And this gives you a way of describing it in terms of Brownian motion, as an exponential function of it. Does that answer your question? AUDIENCE: Right, distribution means that if we have a sample path B_t, that would be the corresponding sample path for S of t? Is it a pointwise evaluation? PROFESSOR: That's a good question, actually.",

But if you think about it path-wise all the time, eventually it fails. But that's a very advanced topic. So what this question is, basically B_t is a probability space, it's a probability distribution over paths. For this equation, if you just look at it, it looks right, but it doesn't really make sense, because B_t-- if it's a probability distribution, what is e to the B_t? Basically, what it's saying is B_t is a probability distribution over paths. If you take omega according to-- a path according to the Brownian motion sample probability distribution, and for this path it's well defined, this function. So the probability density function of this path is equal to the probability density function of e to the whatever that is in this distribution. Maybe it confused you more. Just consider this as some path, some well-defined function,",

I will come back to this point later. In fact, it turns out to be a very deep question and very important question, this question, because if you remember like I hope you remember, in the Riemannian sum, it didn't matter which point you took in this interval. That was the whole point. You have the function. In the interval a_i to a_(i+1), you take any point",

That's how you define the limit. But what's really interesting here is that it's no longer true. If you take the left point all the time, and you take the right point all the time, the two limits are different. And again, that's due to the quadratic variation, because that much of variance can accumulate over time. That's the reason we didn't start with Riemannian sum type definition of integral. But I'll just make one remark. Ito integral is the limit of Riemannian sums when always take the leftmost point of each interval. So you chop down this curve at-- the time interval into pieces, and for each rectangle, pick the leftmost point, and use it as a rectangle.",

I won't be able to go into detail. What's more interesting is instead, what happens if you take the rightmost point all the time, you get an equivalent theory of calculus. It's just like Ito's calculus. It looks really, really similar and it's coherent itself, so there is no logical flaw in it. It all makes sense, but the only difference is instead of a plus in the second-order term, you get minuses. Let me just make this remark, because it's just a theoretical part, this thing, but I think it's really cool. Remark-- there's this and equivalent version. Maybe equivalent is not the right word, but a very similar version of Ito calculus such that basically, what it says is d B_t square is equal to minus dt. Then that changed a lot of things. But this part, it's not that important. Just cool stuff. Let's think about this a little bit more, this fact. Taking the leftmost point all the time means if you want to make a decision for your time interval-- so at time t of i and time t of i plus 1,",

And the reason Ito's calculus works well in our setting is because of this fact, because it has inside it the fact that you cannot see the future. Every decision is made based on the leftmost time. If you want to make a decision for your time interval, you have to do it in the beginning. That intuition is hidden inside of the theory, and that's why it works so well. Let me reiterate this part a little bit more.",

And what it's saying is if your strategy makes your decision at time t is only based on the past values of your stock price, then that's an adapted process. This defines the processes that are reasonable, that cannot see future. And these are all-- in terms of strategy, if delta_t is a portfolio strategy, these are the only meaningful strategies that you can use. And because of what I said before, because we're always taking the leftmost point, adaptive processes just also fit very well with Ito's calculus. They'll come into play altogether. Just a few examples. First, a very stupid example. X_t is adapted to X_t. Of course, because at time, X_t really depends on only X_t, nothing else. Two, X_(t+1) is not adapted to X_t.",

Now we're ready to talk about the properties of Ito's integral. Let's quickly review what we have. First, I defined Ito's lemma-- that means differentiation in Ito calculus. Then I defined integration using differentiation-- integration was an inverse operation of the differentiation. But this integration also had an alternative description in terms of Riemannian sums, where you're taking just the leftmost point as the reference point for each interval. And then, as you see, this naturally had this concept of using the leftmost point. And to abstract that concept, we've come up with this adapted process, very natural process, which is like the real-life procedures, real-life strategies we can think of. Now let's see what happens when you take the integral of adapted processes. Ito integral has really cool properties.",

That means if your stochastic process is some constant times B of t, of course, then you have 0 and c square t. It's still a normal variable. That means if you integrate, that's the integration of some sigma. That's the integration of sigma of dB_t. If sigma is a fixed constant, when you take the Ito integral of sigma times dB_t, this constant, at each time you get a normal distribution. And this is like saying the sum of normal distribution",

If delta t is a process depending only on the time variable-- so it does not depend on the Brownian motion-- then the process X of t equals the integration of delta t dB_t has normal distribution at all time, just like this. We don't know the exact variance yet; the variance will depend on the sigmas. But still, it's like a sum of normal variables, so we'll have normal distribution. In fact, it just gets better and better. The second fact is called Ito isometry. That was cool. Can we compute the variance? Yes?",

This has a name called Ito isometry. Can be used to compute the variance. B_t is a Brownian motion, delta t is adapted to a Brownian motion. Then the expectation of your Ito integral-- that's the Ito integral of your adapted process. That's the variance-- we take the square of it-- is equal to something cool. The square just comes in. Quite nice, isn't it? I won't prove it, but let me tell you why. We already saw this phenomenon before. This is basically quadratic variation. And the proof also uses it. If you take delta s equals to 1-- sorry,",

So on the left you get like expectation of B_t square, and on the right, what you get is t. Because when delta s is equal to 1 at all time, when you have to get from 0 to t you get t, and you have t on the right hand side. That's what it's saying. And that was the content of quadratic variation, if you remember. We're summing the squares-- maybe not exactly this, but you're summing the squares over small intervals. So that's a really good fact that you can use to compute the variance. You have an Ito integral, you know the square, can be computed this simple way. That's really cool. And one more property. This one will be really important. You'll see it a lot in future lectures. It's that when is Ito integral a martingale?",

It doesn't have any natural tendency to go up or go down. No matter which point you stop your process and you see your future, it doesn't have a natural tendency to go up or go down. In formal language, it can be defined as where F_t is the events X_0 up to X_t. So if you take the conditional expectation based on whatever happened up to time t, that expectation will just be whatever value you have at that time. Intuitively, that just means you don't have any natural tendency to go up or go down. Question is, when is an Ito integral a martingale?",

So if dX_t is equal to some function mu, that depends on both t and B_t, times dt, plus sigma of dB_t, what this means is X_t is a martingale if that is 0 at all time, always. And if it's not 0, you have a drift, so it's not a martingale. That gives you some classification. Now, if you look at a differential equation of this stochastic-- this is called a stochastic differential equation-- if you know stochastic process, if you look at a stochastic differential equation, if it doesn't have a drift term, it's a martingale. If it has a drift term, it's not a martingale. That'll be really useful later, so try to remember it. The whole point is when you write down a stochastic process in terms of something times dt, something times dB_t, really this term contributes towards the tendency, the slope of whatever is going to happen in the future. And this is like the variance term. It adds some variance to your stochastic process. But still, it doesn't add or subtract value over time, it fairly adds variation.",

In pricing theory, you come up with this stochastic process or some strategy. You look at its value. Let's say X_t is your value of your portfolio over time. If that portfolio has-- then you match it with your financial-- let me go over it slowly again. First you have a financial derivative, like option of a stock. Then you have your portfolio strategy. Assume that you have some strategy that, at the expiration time, gives you the exact value of the option. Now you look at the difference between these two stochastic processes. Basically what the thing is, when your variance goes to 0, your drift also has to go to 0. So when you look at the difference, if you can somehow get rid of this variance term, that means no matter what you do, that will govern the value of your portfolio.",

But I won't go into further detail because Vasily will cover it next time. But just remember that flavor. So when you write something down in a stochastic differential equation form, that term is a drift term, that term is a variance term. And if you don't have drift, it's a martingale. That is very important. Any questions? That's kind of the basics of Ito calculus. I will give you some exercises on it, mostly just basic computation exercises, so that you'll get familiar with it. Try to practice it. And let me cover one more thing called Girsanov theorem. It's related, but these are really basics of the Ito calculus, so if you have any questions on this, please ask me right now before I move on to the next topic. The last thing I want to talk about today.",

The question is, does there exist a Z depending on omega such that P of omega is equal to Z times P tilde? Do you understand the question? Clearly, if you just look at it, they're quite different. The path that you get according to the distributions are quite different. It's not clear why we should expect it at all. You'll see the answer soon. But let me discuss all this in a different context. Just forget about all the Brownian motion and everything just for a moment. In this concept, changing from one probability distribution to another distribution, it's a very important concept in analysis and probability just in general, theoretically.",

P tilde gives 2/3 probability to 3, 1 over 6 probability to 2, 1 over 6 probability to 3. We have two probability distribution over some space. They are equivalent if, whenever you take a subset of your background set-- let's say 1, 2. When A is equal to 1, 2, according to probability distribution P, the probability you fall into this set A is equal to 2/3. According to P tilde, you have 5/6. They're not the same. The probability itself is not the same, but this condition is satisfied when it's 0. And when it's not 0, it's not 0. And you can just check that it's always true, because they're all positive probabilities. On the other hand, if you take instead, say, 1/3 and 0, now you take your A to be 3. Then you have 1/3 equal to 0. This means, according to probability distribution P,",

The theorem-- there exists a Z such that P of omega is equal to... If and only if P and P tilde are equivalent. You can change from one probability measure to another probability measure just in terms of multiplication, if and only if they're equivalent. And you can see that it's not the case for this when they're not equivalent. You can't make a zero probability to 1/3 probability by multiplication.

            "text": " Our question is, are these two Brownian motions equivalent? The paths that this Brownian motion without drift takes and the Brownian motion with drift takes, are they kind of the same but just skewed in distribution, or are they really fundamentally different? That's the question. And what Girsanov's theorem says is that they are equivalent. To me, it came as a little bit non-intuitive. I would imagine that it's not equivalent, these two. These paths have a very natural tendency. As it goes to infinity, these paths and these paths will really look a lot different, because when you go really, really far, the paths which have drift will be just really close to your line mu of t, while the paths which don't have drift will be really close to the x-axis. But still, they are equivalent. You can change from one to another. I'll just state that theorem without proof. And this will also be used in pricing theory. I'm not an expert enough to tell why, but basically what it's saying is, you switch some stochastic process into a stochastic process without drift,",

That's why I'm trying to cover it, although it's quite a technical theorem. Try to remember at least a statement and the spirit of what it means. It just means these two are equivalent, you can change from one to another by a multiplicative function. Let me just state it in a simple form. GUEST SPEAKER: If I could just interject a comment. PROFESSOR: Sure. GUEST SPEAKER: With these changes of measure, it turns out that all of these theories with continuous time processes should have an interpretation if you've discretized time, and should consider sort of a finer and finer discretization of the process. And with this change of measure, if you consider problems in discrete stochastic processes like random walks, basically how-- say if you're gambling against a casino or against another player, and you look at how your winnings evolve as a random walk, depending on your odds, your odds could be that you will tend to lose.",

You can transform that process, basically by taking out your expected losses, to a process which has zero change in expectation. And so you can convert these gambling problems where there's drift to a version where the process, essentially, has no drift and is a martingale. And the martingale theory in stochastic process courses is very, very powerful. There's martingale convergence theorems. So you know that the limit of the martingale is-- there's a convergence of the process, and that applies here as well. PROFESSOR: You will see some surprising applications. GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

And the reason I have Z tilde instead of Z here is because I flipped. What you really should have is Z tilde here as expectation of Z. If you want to use this Z. I don't expect you to really be able to do computations and do that just by looking at this theorem once. Just really trying to digest what it means and understand the flavor of it, that you can transform problems in one probability space to another probability space. And you can actually do that when the two distributions are defined by Brownian motions when one has drift and one doesn't have a drift. How we're going to use it is we're going to transform a non-martingale process into a martingale process. When you change into martingale it has very good physical meanings to it. That's it for today. And you only have one more math lecture remaining and maybe one or two homeworks but if you have two, the second one won't be that long. And you'll have a lot of guest lectures, exciting guest lectures, so try not to miss them.",
