I put right there a system of equations that's going to be our example to work with. But what are we going to do with it? We're going to solve it. And the method of solution will not be determinants. Determinants are something that will come later. The method we'll use is called elimination. And it's the way every software package solves equations. And elimination, well, if it succeeds, it gets the answer. And normally it does succeed. If the matrix A that's coming into that system is a good matrix, and I think this one is, then elimination will work. We'll get the answer in an efficient way. But why don't we, as long as we're sort of seeing how elimination works -- it's always good to ask how could it fail? So at the same time, we'll see how elimination decides whether the matrix is a good one",

I mean Gauss thought of it before we did, but only because he was born earlier. It's a natural idea... and died earlier, too. Okay, and you've seen the idea. But now, the part that I want to show you is elimination expressed in matrix language, because the whole course -- all the key ideas get expressed as matrix operations, not as words. And one of the operations, of course, that we'll meet is how do we multiply matrices and why? Okay, so there's a system of equations. Three equations and three unknowns. And there's the matrix, the three by three matrix -- so this is the system Ax = b. This is our system to solve, Ax equal -- and the right-hand side is that vector 2, 12, 2. Okay.

So I'm going to -- my first row won't change, that's the pivot row. But I'm going to use it -- and now, finally, let me ask you what the multiplier is. Yes? 3 times that first equation will knock out that 3. Okay. So what will it leave? So the multiplier is 3. 3 times that will make that 0. That was our purpose. 3 2s away from the 8 will leave a 2 and three 1s away from 1 will leave a minus 2. And this guy didn't change. Now the next step -- this is forward elimination and that Okay. step's completed. Oh, well, you could say wait a minute, what about the right hand side? Shall I carry -- the right-hand side gets carried along. Actually MatLab finishes up with the left side before -- and then just goes back to do the right side. Maybe I'll be MatLab for a moment and do that. Okay. I'm leaving a room for a column of b, the right-hand side. But I'll fill it in later. Okay. Now the next step of elimination is what?

So the next step is really the 3,1 step, row three, column one. But of course, I already have 0. Okay. So the multiplier is 0. I take 0 of this equation away from this one and I'm all set. So I won't repeat that, but there was a step there which, MatLab would have to look -- it would look at this number and, do that step, unless you told it in advance that it was 0. Okay. Now what? Now we can see the second pivot, which is what? The second pivot -- see, we've eliminated -- x is now gone from this equation, right? We're down to two equations in y and z. And so now I just do it again. Like, everything's recursive at this -- this is like -- such a basic algorithm and you've seen it, but carry me through one last step. So this is still the first pivot. Now the second pivot is this guy, who has appeared there.",

And now I'm going to take the 3, 2 step. So this all stays the same, 1 2 1, 0 2 -1 and the pivots are there. Now I'm using this pivot, so what's the multiplier? this row, gets subtracted from this row and makes that a 0. So it's 0, 0 and is it a 5? Yeah, I guess it's a 5, is that right? Because I have a one there and I'm subtracting twice of twice this, so I think it's a 5 there. There's the third pivot. So let me put a box around all three pivots. Is there a -- oh, did I just invent a negative one? I'm sorry that the tape can't, correct that as easily as I can. Okay. Thank you very much.",

This elimination step from A -- this matrix I'm going to call U. U for upper triangular. So the whole purpose of elimination was to get from A to U. And, literally, that's the most common calculation in scientific computing. And people think of how could I do that faster? Because it's a major, major thing. But we're doing it the straightforward way. We found three pivots, and by the way, I didn't say this, pivots can't be 0. I don't accept 0 as a pivot. And I didn't get 0. So this matrix is great. It gave me three pivots, I didn't have to do anything special, I just followed the rules and, and the pivots are 1, 2 and 5. By the way, just because I always anticipate stuff from a later day, if I wanted to know the determinant of this matrix -- which I never do want to know, but I would just multiply the pivots. The determinant is 10. So even things like the determinant are here.",

How could -- by fail, I mean to come up with three pivots. I mean, there are a couple of points. I would have already been in trouble if this very first number here was 0. If it was a 0 there -- suppose that had been a 0, there were no Xs in that equation -- first equation. Does that mean I can't solve the problem? Does that mean I quit? No. What do I do? I switch rows. I exchange rows. So in case of a 0, I will not say 0 pivot. I will never be heard to utter those words, 0 pivot. But if there's a 0 in the pivot position, maybe I can say that, I would try to exchange for a lower equation and get a proper pivot up there. Okay. Now, for example, this second pivot came out two. Could it have come out 0? What -- actually, if I change that 8 a little bit, I would have got a little trouble.",

If this had been a negative 4 z, then I would have gone through the same steps. This would have been a minus 4, it still would have been a minus 4. But at the last minute it would have become 0. And there wouldn't have been a third pivot. The matrix would have not been invertible. Well, of course, the inverse of a matrix is coming next week, but, you've heard these words before. So, that's how we identify failure. There's temporary failure when we can do a row exchange -- and get out of it, or there's complete failure when we get a 0 and -- and there's nothing below that we can use. Okay. Let's stay with -- back to success now. In fact, I guess the next topic is back substitution. So what's back substitution? Well, now I'd better bring the right-hand side in. So what would MatLab do and what should we do? Let me bring in the right-hand side as an extra column. So there comes B. So it's 2, 12, I would call this the augmented matrix.",

So this is like the augmented -- no! Damn, circled the wrong thing. Okay. Here is b. Okay, that's the extra column. Okay. So what happened to that extra column, the right-hand side of the equations, when I did the first step? So that was 3 of this away from this, so it took -- the 2 stayed the same, but three 2s got taken away from 12, leaving 6, and that 2 stayed the same. So this is how it's looking halfway along. And let me just carry to the end. The 2 and the 6 stay the same, but -- what do I have here? Oh, gosh. Help me out, now. What -- so now I'm -- This is still like forward elimination.

We're doing it on the fly because it's so easy. And then x is -- so x -- 2y is 2 minus 2, maybe x is 2? So you see what back substitution is. It's the simple step solving the equations in reverse order because the system is triangular. Okay. Good. So that's elimination and back substitution, and I kept the right-hand side along. Okay, now what do I -- that, like, is first piece of the lecture. What's the second piece? Matrices are going to get in. So I wrote stuff with x, y-s and z-s in there, then I really, got the right shorthand, just writing the matrix entries, and now I want to write the operations that I did in matrices, right?",

It's 3 times column one plus 4 times column two plus 5 times column three. Okay. I'm going to come back to that multiple times. What I wanted to do now was to emphasize the parallel thing with rows. Why? Because all our operations here for this two weeks of the course are row operations. So this isn't what I need for row operations. Let me do a row operation. Suppose I have my matrix again and suppose I multiply on the left by some -- let's say 1 2 7. Again, I'm just, like, saying what the result is.",

What's the last row of the matrix? 0 0 1, because that takes one of the third row and none of the other rows, that's great. Okay. Now, suppose I didn't want to do anything at all. Suppose my row -- well, I guess maybe I had a case here when I already had a 0 and, didn't have to do anything. What matrix does nothing, like, just leaves you where you were? If I put in -- if I put in 0 1 0, that would be -- that would be -- that's the matrix -- what's the name of that matrix? The identity matrix, right. So it does absolutely nothing. It just multiplies everything and leaves it where it is. It's like a one, like the number one, for matrices.",

We've got by columns, we've got -- well, we will have by columns, by rows, by each entry at a time. But it's good to see that matrix multiplication when one of the matrices is so simple. So this guy is our elementary matrix. Let's call it E for elementary or elimination. And let me put the indexes 2 1, because it's the matrix that we needed to fix the 2 1 position. It's the matrix that we needed to get this 2 1 position to be Okay. Good enough. So what do I do next? I need another matrix, right? I need to -- there's another step here. And I want to express the whole elimination process in matrix language. So tell me what -- so next step, step two, which was what? Subtract -- what was -- what was the actual step that we did? I think I subtracted -- do you remember?",

Is it a minus 2 to subtract 2 and then this is a 1 so that -- the overall effect is to take minus 2 of this row plus 1 of that. Okay. So, I've now given you the pieces, the elimination matrices, the elementary matrices that take each step. So now what? Now the next point in the lecture is to put those steps together into a matrix that does it all and see how it all happens. So now I'm going to express the whole -- everything we did today so far on A was to start with A, we multiplied it by E 2 1, that was the first step -- and then we multiplied that result by E 3 2 and that led us",

You see why I like matrix notation, because there in, like, little space -- a few bits when its compressed on the web -- is everything -- is this whole lecture. Okay. Now there -- there are important facts about matrix multiplication. And we're close to maybe the most important. And that is this. Suppose I ask you this question. Suppose I start with a matrix A and I want to end with a matrix U and I want to say what matrix does the whole job? What matrix takes me from A to U, using the letters I've got? And the answer is simple. I'm not asking this as -- but it's highly important. How would I create the matrix that does the whole job at once, that does all of elimination in one shot? It would be -- I would just put these together, right? In other words, this is the thing I'm struggling to say.",

I can multiply these two first -- in other words, you see what those parentheses are doing? It's saying -- multiply the Es first and that gives you the matrix that does everything at once. Okay. So this fact, that this is automatically the same as this -- for every matrix multiplication, which I'm conscious of still not telling you in every detail, but, like, you're seeing how it works -- and this is highly important -- and maybe tell me the long word that describes this law for matrices, that you can move the parentheses? It's called the associative law. I think you can now forget that. But don't forget the law. I mean, like, forget the word associative. I don't know. But don't forget the law.

Then it comes out right, because now I'm multiplying a column at a time. This is the first column and says take one -- take none of that column, one of this one and then you got it. Over here, take one of this one, none of this one and you've got a c. So, in short, to do column operations, the matrix multiplies on the right. To do row operations, it multiplies on the left. Okay, okay, and it's row operations that we're really doing. Okay. And of course, I mentioned in passing, but I better say it very clearly that you can't exchange the orders of matrices. And that's just the point I was making again here. A times B is not the same as B times A. You have to keep these matrices in their Gauss given order here, right? But you can move the parentheses, so that, in other words, the commutative law, which would allow you to take it in the other order is false.",

And here is E 3 2. And if I multiply those two matrices together -- E 3 2 and then E 2 1, I'll get a single matrix that does elimination. I don't want to do it that -- if I do that multiplication -- there -- there's a better way to do this. And so in this last few minutes of today's lecture, can I anticipate that better way? The better way is to think not how do I get from A to U, but how do I get from U back to A? So reversing steps is going to come in. Inverse -- I'll use the word inverse here. Okay. So let me make the first step at what's the inverse matrix?",

And let's take the inverse -- well, let me say first what does the inverse mean and find it? Okay. So we're getting a little leg up on inverses. Okay, so this is the final moments of today. Sorry, he's still there. Okay. Inverses. Okay, and I'm just going to take one example and then we're done. The example I'll take will be that E. So my matrix is 1 0 0 minus 3 1 0 0 0 1.
