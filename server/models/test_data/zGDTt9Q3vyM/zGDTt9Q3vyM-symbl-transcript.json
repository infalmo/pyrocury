                "content": " Thank you for everybody coming back. And I should tell you, when I start the session with that little shh, I learned from a congressman in Baltimore. As some of you know, I've spent a lot of time around politics. And one of my roles in politics was that I was the treasurer of the Maryland Democratic Party. Which, if you anybody ever asks you to be the treasurer of a state party, come. I can give you some advice about what that's all about when your home state senator asks you to do it. So I had to quiet down the annual Jefferson Jackson Day dinners. I'd organize these big dinners, and there's 400, 500, 600 people at these dinners. I couldn't do it. I couldn't get their attention. And Congressman Elijah Cummings comes up, and he just leans into the mic. Shh. And it quieted the whole place down. I said, Congressman, what is this? Is this something you've learned in politics, something you learned from your minister, your priest? He said, it works every time, works every time. So Elijah Cummings gave me that little duty. Blockchain and money, we're here. I know it's a little bit like eating broccoli these last couple of classes, because we went through cryptography, and then we moved a little bit into consensus protocols. And today, we're going to pick that up and try to finish up the design bits of Bitcoin. I wanted to introduce, though, one walk-in. We're going to have walk-ins from time to time in this class. But Patrick Murck, he's hiding over here with the cap in the hoodie. He's got the look for a lawyer who's been spending his time around Bitcoin for seven years. Now, he's currently affiliated with Berkman Klein at Harvard. And I didn't know Patrick was going to be here, so I'm calling him out. He's also special counsel of the Cooley law firm. And he has a bunch of clients who try to do the right thing by the law. But sometimes they find themselves dealing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other fine government institutions. But Patrick was also general counsel to the Bitcoin Foundation. And for a short while, you ran it, didn't you, before it kind of went puff? "

We're going to talk a little bit about the design features bringing it all together, and particularly around the reading, which was the academic pedigree of Bitcoin. Which is also a reading that Patrick assigns when he does his study group at Harvard Law, as well. And then, yes, all of you are going to be able to participate. And we're going to take a survey amongst all of you as to who's Satoshi Nakamoto. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Or would you rather do more on transactions script? [LAUGHTER] All right, we'll do a little bit of both. The readings, of course, the Bitcoin Academic Pedigree, which we're going to talk about in the latter part. And I'll do a little cold-calling and get some feedback as to what you thought from the reading or if you're still skimming it. And then there was a CoinDesk article, just making sense of it all. And so as I said, we'll go through the transactions. We'll do a little bit of putting it all together and the Academic Pedigree. We'll have a little fun. You all are going to have a chance to tell us who Satoshi Nakamoto is, or was, or the committee. So transactions-- you've seen this graph before. But transactions, the format in a transaction ledger-- not only in Bitcoin, but really everything-- is somebody on one side of a transaction and somebody on another side of a transaction. So in Bitcoin, there's an input. And the input inside of Bitcoin is an ID of a previous output. So not only is Bitcoin a series of blocks of information-- each block that has 1,000 to 2,000 individual transactions-- but in a sense, there's a separate chain that's going on. I sometimes think of a blockchain as, yes, there's the chain of big chunks of data, but there's also a chain of individual transactions. Shimon, is that a hand raised or just scratching your head? "

Remember initially, 50 coins was what happened initially back in 2009. Now it's 12 and 1/2 coins. And in a short couple-- maybe it's about 18 or 20 months, it goes to 6 and 1/4 coins. And it keeps splitting half and half and half, eventually to no Coinbase. But every transaction, in essence, had to go back all the way to Coinbase-- some Coinbase, some 50 or 25 or 12 and 1/2 coins being issued. And then the output-- so a transaction format is pretty straightforward, in a sense. The input is a previous output and a digital signature, and then, to whom do you want to send it. And it's sent to Bitcoin addresses. That's why we spent just a moment-- we just glossed over what a Bitcoin address is. It's sort of a translation to a public key, but it's not identical to a public key. And of course, you need value. Value measured in bitcoins or satoshis, or if we're on the Ethereum network, it would be an ether and gas, et cetera, et cetera. On 1,600 different platforms, it could be a different native currency. Lock time, I don't think lock time was in any of the readings. But anybody want to tell me what a lock time is? It's relevant to some of how the technology goes. Anybody want to take a guess? Where's Alin? Not Alin the PhD, but Alin from the digital currency initiative. No? You're hiding. You don't want to say what a lock time is? "

Turing complete allows you to do loops inside of computer programs. And the script language does not allow that to happen. Every function needs to sort of have some language. I know Alin looking at me to see I don't dive. But to answer Emily's question, it's just, there's so many different ways to condition a transaction. And Satoshi Nakamoto thought, well, let's put it in here, right in the transaction format, that you can condition on time. And then two parties could do that. To your question about whether it could inadvertently lead to double spending, it's a very good question. Can I hold it until we just do validation for a second? So this is a unique identifier for the input. But it's really uniquely identifying from a past output. What's the block number? Is it from the 250,000th block or the 300,000th block? So it takes literally a block ID. And then within that block, which one of its 1,500 transactions might it be? So you can find any transaction on an entire blockchain by knowing the block, and then within the block, which transaction. It's just a data mechanism on how to store data. And through this mechanism, there's a chain of transactions, as well as a chain of blocks. And then the value we talked about that-- I think there's, if I did my numbers right, 10 to the 8th satoshis in every bitcoin. It's a little hard because I think there's 10 to the ninth gas in every ether. And that's a coin. That is what is a coin. When Satoshi Nakamoto did this, it wasn't really a coin, because it was a question whether anybody would give value. And until about 18 months later, when those two pizzas went for 10,000 bitcoin, what was it? Or until somebody started the first exchange, a crypto exchange, to exchange that. So you can also have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. And I'm going to use an example that I just created of, I want to send some bitcoins to two different people. And I need some bitcoins. So I might grab three former inputs. And these are just Transaction ID 6, Index 3. Of course, it wouldn't be ID 6. It might be ID 300,000. But the point being is, grab 10 bitcoin, so I want to find three inputs. And I needed to send six bitcoins, let's say, to Amanda. You like that. And just because you're sitting up front, James, I'm just going to send three. But I'm not using Amanda's name and James' name. I'm using your Bitcoin address-- Amanda's Bitcoin address, and James' Bitcoin address. So rather than being account-based, like if you have an account at Bank of America, and you say, I want to send $10, I just check to make sure I have more than $10. In Bitcoin, I actually have to fine individual transaction outputs that add up to-- in this case, I want to send nine bitcoin, six to Amanda, three to James. Not really, Amanda. So what's 10 minus 9?

So a Bitcoin transaction can either be equal, the inputs equal the outputs. I could have sent one back to me. But I've decided to incentivize miners and leave a little extra, 0.1 bitcoin, which would be a lot of fee, actually. That would be about, what, $640 or so? I probably wouldn't do that. I would probably leave for a fee 10 or 20 or 100 satoshi maybe. I don't know what the current market is. But this is a transaction. Multiple inputs, multiple outputs, but you always have to send back to yourself. What happens to these inputs if this transaction actually happens? They go away. The actual inputs disappear once they go through this. And so inputs always have to equal outputs. When a transaction is validated, one of the validation methods is to make sure that the lock time has actually happened, that you've passed the lock time. Another validation point is that inputs are greater than or equal to outputs. If outputs are greater than inputs, the transaction will not be validated. The digital signatures have to be validated, going just back to the prior slide. That digital signature has to be validated, as well. And that, this previous ID and index actually exists. And this is getting to your question Emily. It still exists. But these inputs, once you've used them, they no longer exist in the database. They're kind of in the past. So that's the transactions. That's the core. I know it's like eating broccoli, but it's an important part of all of blockchain technology. The Coinbase transaction we've already talked about, so I'll slide over this quickly. But it's a reward for solving the puzzle. In the case of Bitcoin, it's solving the proof of work. Tom. "

One is, this is more decentralized possibly today than the current commercial banking system, for instance, for transaction processing, or the transaction processing that Visa and First Data do, which we'll study when we get to payments. So it's possibly more decentralized. I think you said it was more decentralized, but I'm putting the word possibly in there. And two is that, at least in bitcoin's case, there's two revenue sources for providing the services. The miners do it for the Coinbase transactions, 12 and 1/2 bitcoin per block, approximately $80,000 US per block currently. But also, there's this little incentive of fees, which, over time, will have to grow as you go down. If it's only going to be one bitcoin per transaction, and then ultimately almost 0 bitcoin for transaction, there will have to be more satoshis in the fee side. And some alternative coins-- not Bitcoin-- are more modeled on fees, and some coins are more modeled on mining rewards. The economics-- Satoshi Nakamoto, whomever he or she was, or were, if it's a group, had to think through a bunch of economics. They've survived for 10 years. It doesn't mean that's the best set of microeconomics for a blockchain system. Tom, you look really skeptical. "

The theory of the case is that, within 100 blocks or 1,000 minutes, somehow that would be discovered. But if it weren't, you might have a little bit of what James is raising as a question. But that's at least the theory of the case. It's always recorded as the first transaction in the Merkle Tree. Highly technical point, but it has to roll up into that darn thing we were talking about, the data compression at the Merkle Tree. And here's a little fun fact. You can add 100 bytes of arbitrary data in a Coinbase. You might say, why does he raise this? Well, because it's just a fun little place that some people express their creative wit, artistic stuff, send secret messages to each other, that, buried in the Coinbase transactions, there is a whole forensics of fun little things that sometimes miners put in to the Coinbase, for those of you who are artistic. The very first genesis block had this sentence. \"The Times, January 3, 2009, Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\" That was a headline out of the Financial Times that says Satoshi Nakamoto put in the first block of Coinbase. It's just a little fun place. There's a playfulness that goes on amongst miners, sometimes talking to each other. Did you ever get a message? Did anybody send you-- "

And bitcoin transactions that haven't been spent fall into this. And you can use it. It's created because it speeds up the whole system. Instead of going back and looking for all these things, there's actually a database that has all the unspent transactions. I include in here what I find as a sort of interesting revelation or irony. When Satoshi built Bitcoin, and for the 16 versions that have come since over the 10 years, all the developers, the Bitcoin core developers, have kept the unspent transaction output, not on a blockchain specifically, but in a database called a LevelDB database. So those of you who are closer to computer science than I could say all the pros and cons of a LevelDB database. But I'm just observing that, even within the most used first central database for blockchain called Bitcoin, they chose to use not a blockchain, but, in essence, a more standard database to keep the unspent transaction output. Now, in a sense, it's all part of this blockchain solution. I'm just saying, it's one database within the blockchain world that's actually not a blockchain. It's just sort of an interesting irony. But it also sort of says, economically and technologically, Satoshi was trying to create a money system. He wasn't trying to use blockchain for every bit of data. So this is the actual size of the unspent transaction output. If you can't see, there's-- I think it's about 50 to 60 million. It was higher. There was about 60 million unspent. It's not 60 million bitcoins, because there's about 17 million bitcoin. So you could average it out. You could say, well, each transaction has less than 1 bitcoin. Well actually, there's been surveys and studies showing that about half of these 54 million transactions are so small that they go by the term of-- they're called dust. That there's so few satoshi that it's not even worth the fees to try to redeem them. They only add up to less than a half a percent of all the outstanding bitcoin, but they're just dust. So maybe out of these 54 million unspent transaction outputs, half of them will never be used, because it's not economically worthwhile. It's like the pennies in the top dresser drawer that you all might not spend. There's this similar thing here. Hugo. "

There had been, in the past, another 290 million outputs that have already been spent. Are we together? So there's a scripting language. There's a little bit of computer code. I said there was no prerequisite to take any computer science before you were here. And my own computer programming is so old, because when I was programming, it was in Fortran and APL. And you can look that up. It's kind of like around with cuneiform and you know the Rosetta Stone. But Satoshi Nakamoto decided to put a little bit of computer programming inside. And I'm not going to get the count right, but there's several hundred, but not several thousand, little operations and codes that you can use in the Bitcoin script. It's not Turing complete, which means you can't do a lot of the things that you can do in all the rest of computer science. But it's more secure. In essence, it has fewer attack vectors. It's harder to bring down a little bit. It's a programming code, as I said. For those interested, it's called stack-based, where you sort of move the code over one at a time as it's being performed. And it gives some flexibility. And back to Emily's question about why there was lock time, or Shimon's, scripting code allows for some conditionality, that it appears that Nakamoto was trying to give some ability to condition a transaction on events, but not so much conditionality, so much flexibility, that he needed a Turing complete. So he kind of, I'm going to say, chose a midway place. I believe, you could have created Bitcoin and say there was no scripting language. It was just going to be a straight instruction, moving this input to another output. Created a little bit of computer code, but not a lot. That's what I think of the economics and the marketplace for this. And next Tuesday when we talk about smart contracts-- and I promise you, there's a reason for the craziness of my talking about Turing complete and scripting code. Because next Tuesday, we'll be talking about smart contracts where they're much more flexible. And so this is sort of the foundational-- and you don't need to know anything more about computer science than you want, unless you go with Tom down that rabbit hole and spend more time reading. So there's four different types of, I call them script types. They're not actual script words, but you will read about these from time to time. And I just wanted to cover these four. The UTXO, remember, is about 54 million transactions. And there's been a nice academic paper that I didn't assign that was written earlier this year that investigated the whole 54 million, all of the unspent transactions. And this is how it broke down. 81% are transactions that send to a hash of a Bitcoin address. Eight, nine years ago when Satoshi created this, that was not the most popular instruction. But it's basically sending an output to the hash, the compression, the commitment of a Bitcoin address. We're now up to 18%. This didn't exist three and four years ago, really. But 18% go to a conditional script. It's a hash of a conditional script. So somebody saying, Emily, it's not even about time. It's like, you can only get it when all these other instructions that are in the scripting language happen. And I'm going to hide the conditions in a hash of it. And then only 0.1% goes the way that he first envisioned nine years ago, directly to a Bitcoin address. So it's either to a hash of a Bitcoin address, a hash of a conditional script, and a little less than 1% now go to multiple signatures. Meaning, you need two out of three or three out of five. Or believe it or not, this academic paper shows that some say 0 out of 1. Now, it's hard to believe that somebody mistakenly programmed something to go to 0 signatures, but apparently somebody did. So I just wanted to give you a sense there's some flexibility in the computer code, not a lot of flexibility, but just enough that you can do things that are really helpful. And they're going to solve a lot of challenges for Bitcoin. Hugo mentioned layer 2. We're going to be talking about layer 2 later in the semester, where there's a whole way to put technology on top of Bitcoin. And it's because the scripting language is there that you can do that. Any questions on script? I know I'm trying to cover a big, weighty topic in 120 seconds or less. No? So just back to the whole-- this is just a review. What have we've talked about? There's that little graphic again. It's just a bunch of blocks. That's what a blockchain is. Though today, we realize that underneath the blocks, we have another chain. I often think of two chains-- the chains of blocks. In Bitcoin, there's about a half a million blocks. But underneath that, there's all the transactions that are, in fact, chained, as well. 54 million of those outputs have not yet been spent and 290 million outputs have been spent. But underneath about a half a million blocks, there's been 340 million outputs, so to speak. It creates a database. Bitcoin is a transaction database. Next Tuesday, we'll talk about an account-based database in Ethereum. But it could be a ledger which is transactions or a ledger which is balances. Satoshi Nakamoto decided to do transactions here. In some ways, I believe it's because it was fewer attack vectors. Probably a little bit more secure, but I'm not entirely sure. And until you solve the riddle as to who Satoshi Nakamoto is, we won't know the answer. Of Course, hash functions we talked about, and digital signatures, and a consensus protocol. So I like to think of it in three buckets, whether it's for a dinner party conversation or digging into three lectures. It's the cryptography itself. We did that last Thursday. And if you have to remember anything, it's only two cryptographic primitives-- hash functions and digital signatures. How many people think they kind of roughly have what a hash function is? All right, so I lost half of you. [LAUGHTER] All right, is there anything I can do for Lauren's table? I didn't see a single hand go up. Are you reading your Facebook page or are you listening to the class? You've got your computer open. What's your name. "

Down in Baltimore, Maryland, I'm in 2120-- well, I grew up in 21208. It was my parent's zip code. I won't say my current. We're being videoed. [LAUGHTER] And so I think of it a little bit like that.

If they were on, call that a 1. If it was off, call it a 0. I'm not sure which way it goes. I keep looking at Alin. And so all data can then be brought down to a series of 0's and 1. And if you put four 0's and 1's in front of each other, 2 times 2 times 2 times 2, 2 to the fourth is 16, all of a sudden, you see if you keep going 2 to something, you can get a lot of data.

The actual technical answer to that is, no, you don't have to wait 10 minutes, unless you want final settlement, if you want finality with no counterparty risk, no commercial risk. Hugo is saying, well, if I'm willing to take some economic or commercial counterparty risk, which is, in finance, you take it all the time, then maybe I can do it in less than 10 minutes. And in fact, even Starbucks, when Starbucks accepts your credit card swipe, they're taking a little bit of counterparty risk from the payment processing company First Data. I don't mean to say that it might not be also from Visa and the banks. But I'll just say the payment system has some counterparty risk. Because final settlement in our payment system doesn't happen within seconds. So the actual answer-- thank you, Hugo. Clean me up again. You should do this all the time. Everybody should clean me up. It's that final settlement can happen. And so you have to find other solutions, whether it's some commercial arrangement with counterparty risk or other technical commercial arrangements. Shimon? "

They overlap, but they're not the same. So think of a Venn diagram. But it's a very good question. The essence of mining is creating an incentive structure where there is no central authority to validate and put a new set of transactions or data-- I'm going to say broadly, data-- into the ledger, into the accepted state of what reality is. So mining helps with that. That's that whole process. In essence, who gets to decide the next block of data? Transactions are included in the data, but it's not identical. Mining is really critical, but it's not the only component. In terms of transactions, then you have to actually think of, well, there's this other thing going on. Well, there's been 340 million of these in the Bitcoin network so far. And has it been used already? Has it been spent? Does it have an appropriate digital signature? If there's a time lock on it, is there a condition? Might there even be this little bit of scripting code that puts other conditions, like there has to be multiple signatures? Has it been double spent? It was a very good question. They overlap a lot. One thing you can just remember is, mining is about that there's been a half a million blocks. Transactions, there's been 340 million. So there must be something else going on in all those transactions. Does that help a bit? Kelly? "

And that's something that really hadn't existed before. And so that's really novel. That's sort of the breakthrough that I think you can attribute to that particular white paper. I also use this as a way to give a clean definition of blockchain, which is a badly abused term, as I'm sure you'll discover through the rest of this class. It's saying, to me, a blockchain is something that is born from Nakamoto Consensus. Blockchains, as they discuss in that paper, have existed for decades. That's not even a novel data structure.

We're in a little better place with Lauren's table now. All right, good, good. My goal is not to embarrass anybody when I ask these questions. My goal is that we all come along on this journey, that we somehow have some basis. Because it does relate to understanding the commercial reality and the economics. We talked about the time stamping and the blocks, the Merkle Trees, which is not a deep part of it, and of course, digital signatures. Part of the reason I replay this each time is because, in politics, I, of course, learned that repetition is a really important thing. [LAUGHTER] But I also think it's true in academic settings. And then Bitcoin addresses, and that's just a cleanup, that it's not an identical to a public. And then the proof of work, and back to the questions. Nakamoto Consensus is, yes, all of this and an incentive structure, but it's this proof of work. And to Erin's question, proof of work is a little bit different than the transactions that we talked about, but there's a lot of overlap. And then it creates the native currency. And I've corrected this slide to 2140, of course. The network is really critical, too, and that there's all these different actors on a network, 10,000 nodes and this many light nodes and the miners and the mining pool operators. And they all have their separate economics. And so if anybody wants to come and get office hours, talk about those economics, please come on in. If there's nothing you remember from the reading, I've now read this paper probably six times to kind of slowly get it through my head. But every time I read the Clark paper, I go, wow, that really helps me. Because it's not like Satoshi Nakamoto just flipped his fingers and there it-- it was on the backs of a lot of cryptography, a lot of technology earlier. But this is the chart I turn back to, and it's sometimes helps me. Ah, there's time-stamping, there's digital cache, there's proof of work, and how these things. Maybe 10 years from now, they'll look back and Nakamoto's stuff will just be built upon. That's the central question. That's what some of our colleagues are doing over at the Digital Currency Initiative or over at the Computer Sciences Lab. They're saying, can they build upon this and take it to another level? Right now-- and you'll see throughout the semester-- there's not a lot of full scale applications of this technology. But it might just be in a whole line of this.
