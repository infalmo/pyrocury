So the last section of this chapter is two point seven that talks about permutations, which finished the previous lecture, and transposes, which also came in the previous lecture. There's a little more to do with those guys, permutations and transposes. But then the heart of the lecture will be the beginning of what you could say is the beginning of linear algebra, the beginning of real linear algebra which is seeing a bigger picture with vector spaces -- not just vectors, but spaces of vectors and sub-spaces of those spaces. So we're a little ahead of the syllabus, which is good, because we're coming to the place where, there's a lot to do. Okay. So, to begin with permutations. Can I just -- so these permutations, those are matrices P and they execute",

That description of elimination assumes that we don't have a P, that we don't have any row exchanges. And now I just want to say, okay, how do I account for row exchanges? Because that doesn't. The P in this factorization is the identity matrix. The rows were in a good order, we left them there. Maybe I'll just add a little moment of reality, too, about how Matlab actually does elimination. Matlab not only checks whether that pivot is not zero, as every human would do. It checks for is that pivot big enough, because it doesn't like very, very small pivots. Pivots close to zero are numerically bad. So actually if we ask Matlab to solve a system, it will do some elimination some row exchanges, which we don't think are necessary. Algebra doesn't say they're necessary, but accuracy -- numerical accuracy says they are.",

And then, the result is -- it's hiding here. It's the main fact. This is the description of elimination with row exchanges. So A equal L U becomes P A equal L U. So this P is the matrix that does the row exchanges, and actually it does them -- it gets the rows into the right order, into the good order where pivots will not -- where zeroes won't appear in the pivot position, where L and U will come out right as up here. So, that's the point. Actually, I don't want to labor that point, that a permutation matrix -- and you remember what those were. I'll remind you from last time of what the main points about permutation matrices were -- and then just leave this factorization",

Okay. We'll be interested in matrices that have P transpose P equal the identity. There are more of them than just permutations, but my point right now is that permutations are like a little group in the middle -- in the center of these special matrices. Okay. So now we know how many there are. Twenty four in the case of -- there are twenty four four by four permutations, there are five factorial which is a hundred and twenty, five times twenty four would bump us up to a hundred and twenty -- so listing all the five by five permutations would be not so much fun. Okay. So that's permutations. Now also in section two seven is some discussion of transposes. And can I just complete that discussion. First of all, I haven't even transposed a matrix",

The transpose will be two rows and three columns, two by three. So it's short and wider. And, of course, that row -- that column becomes a row -- that column becomes the other row.

And, actually, it was the number in A which was in row J, column I. So the row and column -- the row and column numbers just get reversed. The row number becomes the column number, the column number becomes the row number. No problem. Okay. Now, a special -- the best matrices, we could say. In a lot of applications, symmetric matrices show up. So can I just call attention to symmetric matrices? What does that mean? What does that word symmetric mean? It means that this transposing doesn't change the matrix. A transpose equals A. And an example. So, let's take a matrix that's symmetric, so whatever is sitting on the diagonal --",

I happened to use all positive numbers as its entries. That's not the point. The point is that if I transpose that matrix, I get it back again. So symmetric matrices have this property A transpose equals A. I guess at this point -- I'm just asking you to notice this family of matrices that are unchanged by transposing. And they're easy to identify, of course. You know, it's not maybe so easy before we had a case where the transpose gave the inverse. That's highly important, but not so simple to see. This is the case where the transpose gives the same matrix back again. That's totally simple to see. Okay. Could actually -- maybe I could even say when would we get such a matrix? For example, this -- that matrix is absolutely far from symmetric, right? The transpose isn't even the same shape --",

Then I think that if I multiply those together, I get a symmetric matrix. Can I just do it with the numbers and then ask you why, how did I know it would be symmetric? So my point is that R transpose R is always symmetric. Okay? And I'm going to do it for that particular R transpose R which was -- let's see, the column was one two four three three one. I called that one R transpose, didn't I, and I called this guy one two four three three one. I called that R. Shall we just do that multiplication? Okay, so up here I'm getting a ten.

That seven will show up here because one three times four one gave the seven, but also four one times one three will give that seven. Do you see that it works?

Just like inverses, which we did prove, same rule for transposes and -- which we'll now use. So the order gets reversed. It's the transpose of that that comes first, and the transpose of this that comes -- no. Is that -- yeah. That's what I have to write, right? This is a product of two matrices and I want its transpose. So I put the matrices in the opposite order and I transpose them. But what have I got here? What is R transpose transpose? Well, don't all speak at once. R transpose transpose, I flipped over the diagonal, I flipped over the diagonal again, so I've got R. And that's just my point, that if I started with this matrix,",

            "text": " what do we do with vectors? We add them. We know how to add two vectors. We multiply them by numbers, usually called scalers. If we have a vector, we know what three V is. If we have a vector V and W, we know what V plus W is. Those are the two operations that we've got to be able to do. To legitimately talk about a space of vectors, the requirement is that we should be able to add the things and multiply by numbers and that there should be some decent rules satisfied. Okay. So let me start with examples. So I'm talking now about vector spaces. And I'm going to start with examples. Let me say again what this word space is meaning. When I say that word space, that means to me that I've got a bunch of vectors, a space of vectors. But not just any bunch of vectors. It has to be a space of vectors -- has to allow me to do the operations that vectors",

Let's see, I guess I should do algebra first. Algebra means what can I do to these vectors? I can add them. I can add that to that. And how do I do it? A component at a time, of course.

Definitely it's in R^3. It's got three components. One of them happens to be zero, but that's a perfectly okay number. So that's a vector in R^3. We don't want to mix up the -- I mean, keep these vectors straight and keep R^n straight. So what's R^n? R^n. So this is our big example, is all vectors with n components. And I'm making these darn things column vectors. Can I try to follow that convention, that they'll be column vectors, and their components should be real numbers. Later we'll need complex numbers and complex vectors, but much later. Okay. So that's a vector space.",

We can multiply by any number and we're still in R^2. We can take any combination and we're still in R^2. And same goes for R^n. It's -- honesty requires me to mention that these operations of adding and multiplying have to obey a few rules. Like, we can't just arbitrarily say, okay, the sum of three two and pi e is zero zero. It's not. The sum of three two and minus three two is zero zero. So -- oh, I'm not going to -- the book, actually, lists the eight rules that the addition and multiplication have to satisfy, but they do. They certainly satisfy it in R^n and usually it's not those eight rules that are in doubt. What's -- the question is, can we do those additions and do we stay in the space? Let me show you a case where you can't. So suppose this is going to be not a vector space.",

All the vectors with positive or at least not negative components. Can I add those safely? Yes. If I add a vector with, like, two -- three two to another vector like five six, I'm still up in this quarter, no problem with adding. But there's a heck of a problem with multiplying by scalers, because there's a lot of scalers that will take me out of this quarter plane, like negative ones. If I took three two and I multiplied by minus five, I'm way down here. So that's not a vector space, because it's not -- closed is the right word. It's not closed under multiplication by all real numbers. So a vector space has to be closed under multiplication and addition of vectors. In other words, linear combinations.",

Vector spaces that follow the rules, but they -- we don't need all of -- see, there we started with R^2 here, and took part of it and messed it up. What we got was not a vector space. Now tell me a vector space that is part of R^2 and is still safely -- we can multiply, we can add and we stay in this smaller vector space. So it's going to be called a subspace. So I'm going to change this bad example to a good one. Okay. So I'm going to start again with R^2, but I'm going to take an example -- it is a vector space, so it'll be a vector space inside R^2. And we'll call that a subspace of R^2.",

If that vector's in my little subspace and it's a true subspace, then there's got to be some more in it, right? I have to be able to multiply that by two, and that double vector has to be included. Have to be able to multiply by zero, that vector, or by half, or by three quarters. All these vectors. Or by minus a half, or by minus one. I have to be able to multiply by any number. So that is going to say that I have to have that whole line. Do you see that? Once I get a vector in there -- I've got the whole line of all multiples of that vector. I can't have a vector space without extending to get those multiples in there. Now I still have to check addition. But that comes out okay. This line is going to work, because I could add something on the line to something else on the line and I'm still on the line. So, example. So this is all examples of a subspace --",

Because if I multiplied that vector on the dashed line by zero, then I'm down here, I'm not on the dashed line. Z- zero's got to be. Every subspace has got to contain zero -- because I must be allowed to multiply by zero and that will always give me the zero vector. Okay. Now, I was going to make -- create some subspaces.

And one possibility that we always allow is all of R two, the whole thing, the whole space. That counts as a subspace of itself. You always want to allow that. Then the others are lines -- any line, meaning infinitely far in both directions through the zero. So that's like the whole space -- that's like whole two D space. This is like one dimension. Is this line the same as R^1 ? No. You could say it looks a lot like R^1. R^1 was just a line and this is a line. But this is a line inside R^2. The vectors here have two components. So that's not the same as R^1, because there the vectors only have one component. Very close, you could say, but not the same. Okay.",

The zero vector alone, only. I'll often call this subspace Z, just for zero. Here's a line, L. Here's a plane, all of R^2. So, do you see that the zero vector's okay? You would just -- to understand subspaces, we have to know the rules -- and knowing the rules means that we have to see that yes, the zero vector by itself, just this guy alone satisfies the rules. Why's that? Oh, it's too dumb to tell you. If I took that and added it to itself, I'm still there. If I took that and multiplied by seventeen, I'm still there. So I've done the operations, adding and multiplying by numbers, that are required, and I didn't go outside this one point space. So that's always -- that's the littlest subspace.

So if I'm in ordinary three dimensions, the subspace is R, all of R^3 at one extreme, the zero vector at the bottom. And then a plane, a plane through the origin. Or a line, a line through the origin. So with R^3, the subspaces were R^3, plane through the origin, line through the origin and a zero vector by itself, zero zero zero, just that single vector. Okay, you've got the idea. But, now comes -- the reality is -- what are these -- where do these subspaces come -- how do they come out of matrices? And I want to take this matrix -- oh, let me take that matrix. So I want to create some subspaces out of that matrix. Well, one subspace is from the columns. Okay.

Please think about that. That's the picture you have to see. You sure have to see it in R^3 , because we're going to do it in R^10, and we may take a combination of five vectors in R^10, and what will we have? God knows. It's some subspace. We'll have five vectors. They'll all have ten components. We take their combinations. We don't have R^5 , because our vectors have ten components. And we possibly have, like, some five dimensional flat thing going through the origin for sure. Well, of course, if those five vectors were all on the line, then we would only get that line. So, you see, there are, like, other possibilities here. It depends what -- it depends on those five vectors. Just like if our two columns had been on the same line, then the column space would have been only a line. Here it was a plane.",

Take its columns, take their combinations, all their linear combinations and you get the column space. And that's the central sort of -- we're looking at linear algebra at a higher level. When I look at A -- now, I want to look at Ax=b. That'll be the first thing in the next lecture. How do I understand Ax=b in this language -- in this new language of vector spaces and column spaces. And what are other subspaces? So the column space is a big one, there are others to come. Okay, thanks.",
