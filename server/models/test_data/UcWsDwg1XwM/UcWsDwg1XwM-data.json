It seems to me so easy to be lost in the big calculus textbooks and the many, many problems and in the details. But do you see the big picture? Well, I hope this will help. For me, calculus is about the relation between two functions. And one example for those two functions, one good example, is function 1, the distance, distance traveled, what you see on a trip meter in a car. And function 2, the one that goes with distance, is speed,",

I could get more and more, but I think if we get these two pairs, we can move forward. So in this second pair, height is function 1, how high you've climbed. If it's a graph, how far the graph goes above the axis. Up, in other words. So that's height, and then the other one tells you how fast you climb. The height tells how far you climbed. It could be a mountain. And then the slope tells you how quickly you're climbing at each point. Are you going nearly straight up? Flat? Possibly down? So distance and speed, height and slope will serve as good examples to start with. And let me give you some letters, some algebra letters that you might use. Distance, maybe I would call that f of t.

So f is telling you how far. y is telling you the height of a graph. That's function 1, two examples of function 1. Now, what about slope? Well, luckily, speed and slope start with the same letter, so I'll often use s for the speed or the slope for this second-- oh, it even stands for a second function. But let me tell you also the right-- the official-- letters that make the connection between function 2 and function 1. If my function is a function of time, the distance, how far I go, then the speed is-- the right letters are df dt. Everybody uses those letters. So let me say again how to pronounce: df dt.",

Again, I'll just repeat how to say that: dy dx. And that is the slope, and we have to understand what those symbols mean. Right now, I'm just writing them down as symbols. May I begin with the most important and the simplest example of all? Let me take that case. OK, so the key example here, the one to get completely straight is the case of constant speed, constant slope. I'll just graph that. So here I'm go to graph. Shall I make it the speed? Yeah, let's say speed. So time is going along that way. Speed is up this way. And I'm going to say in this first example that the speed is the same. We're traveling at the constant speed",

For now, I'll just write 40. OK, now if we're traveling at a speed of 40 miles per hour, what's the distance? Well, let me start with the trip meter at zero. so this is time again, and now this is going to be the distance. After one hour, my distance is 40. So if I mark t equal to 1, I've reached 40. That's height of 40. At t equal to 2, I've reached 80. At t equal to 1/2, half an hour, I've reached 20. Those points lie on a line. The graph of distance covered when you're just traveling at a steady rate, constant rate, constant speed is just a straight line.",

What's the slope if that's the distance if I look at my trip meter and I know I'm traveling along at that constant speed, how do I find that speed? Well, slope, it's the distance up, which would be 40 after one hour, divided by the distance across, 40/1, or 80/2. Doesn't matter, because we're traveling at constant speed, so the slope, which is up, over, across is 40/1, 80/2, 20 over 1/2. I'll put 80/2 as one example: 40. Oh, let me do it-- that's arithmetic.

OK, what about-- calculus goes both ways. We can go both ways here. We already have practically. Here I went in the direction from 1 to 2. Now, I want to go in the direction-- suppose I know the speed. How do I recover the distance? If I know my speed is 40 and I know I started at zero, what's my distance? Distance or height, either one. So these are like both. Now, I'm just going the other way. Well, you see how. How do I find f?",

And, of course, the slope is still 40. It's still the slope of that line. Yeah, so that really what I'm measuring in speed there, I don't always have to be starting at t equals 0, and I don't always have to be starting at f equals 0. Oh, let me draw that. Suppose I started at f equals 40. My trip meter happened to start at 40. After an hour, I'd be up to 80. After another hour, I'd be up to 120. Do you see that this starting the trip meter, who cares where the trip meter started? It's the change in the trip meter that tells how long the trip was. Clear. OK, so that's that example. We come back to it because it's the basic one where the speed is constant. And even if now I have to move to a changing speed, you have to let me bring calculus into these lectures.

I'm going to start out at a good speed, but I'm going to slow down. Do you see me slowing down there? I don't mean slowing down with the chalk. I mean slowing down with slope. The slope started out steep. By here, by that point, the slope was zero. What was the car doing here? The car is certainly moving forward because the distance is increasing. Here it's increasing faster. Here it's increasing barely. In other words, we're putting on the brakes. The car is slowing down. We're coming to a red light. In fact, there is the red light right at that time. Now, just stay with it to think what would the speed look like for this problem? If that's a picture of the function, just let's get some idea. I'm not going to have a formula yet.",

That's function one to two, finding the speed. Going the other direction is called integral calculus. The step is called integration when you take the speed over that period of time, and you recover the distance. So it's differential calculus in one direction, integral calculus in the other. Now, here's a question. Let me continue that curve a little longer. I got it to the red light. Now imagine that the distance starts going down from that point. What's happening? The distance is decreasing. The car is going backwards. It's going in reverse. The speed, what's the speed? Negative. The speed, because distance is going from higher to lower,",

You see, two different curves, but same information. I'm remembering an old movie. I don't know if you saw an old B movie called Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Did you see that? So the kid had borrowed his father's-- not borrowed, but lifted his father's good car and drove it a lot like so and put on a lot of mileage. The trip meter was way up, and he knew his father was going to notice this. So he had the idea to put the car up on a lift, put it in reverse, and go for a while, and the trip meter would go backwards. I don't know if trip meters do go backwards. It's kind of tough to watch them while going in reverse.",

Later, we got more functions. But let me take an example, just because these pairs of functions are everywhere. What could I take? Maybe height of a person. Height of a person. OK, so this is now another example, just to get practice in the relation between the height of a person and the rate of change of the height. So this is the height. Maybe I'll call it y. Let me write height of a person. And what is this going to be? What is function two? Well, slope doesn't seem quite right. The point about function two is it tells how fast function one changes. It's the rate of change of the height. It's the rate of change. So let me call it s, and it'll be the rate of change.",

OK, there is an example in which I don't-- also I'm sure people have devised approximate formulas for average growth rates, but you see, I'm not-- it's the idea of the relation between function one and function two that I'm emphasizing. Now, my last example, let me take one more example, one more example for this first lecture. So let me take a case in which the speed is-- so here will be my two-- let's use speed. Let's use this as distance. This is distance again, and graph two, as always, will be speed. And I'm going to take a case in which it's given by a formula. I'm going to let the speed be increasing steadily.",

That's where you get a straight line. s is let's say a times t. That a, a physicist, if we were physicists, would say acceleration. You're accelerating. You're keeping your foot on the gas, steadily speeding up, and so then s is proportional to t. Now, think about the distance. What's happening with distance? If this is accelerating, you're going faster and faster. You're covering more and more speed, more and more distance, more and more quickly. If this is slope, the slope is increasing. Look, the graph-- let's start the trip meter at zero. So you started with a speed of zero. You were not really increasing distance until you got slightly beyond zero, and then it slightly started to increase. But then it increases faster and faster, right?",

But here is a neat fact about going from two to one, that if this is the time t, then, of course, this height here will be a times t. And the amazing fact is that this graph tells you the area under this one. Graph one-- function one-- tells you the area under the graph two. And in this example with a nice constant acceleration, steady increase in speed, we know this. This is a triangle. It has a base of t. It has a height of at. And the area of a triangle, of course, the area, and my point is that the area is function one-- amazing; that's just terrific-- will be-- the area of this triangle here is 1/2 of the base times the height.",

If I go back to the first letters that I mentioned, if this is my function f, then this is my function that-- and notice what kind of a curve that is. Do you recognize that with a square? That tells me it's a parabola, a famous and important curve. And, of course, it's important because it has such a neat formula. OK, so we have found the function one. We've recovered the information in that lost black box, the distance box, the trip meter, from what we did find in black box two, the speed, the record of speed. And notice, I'm using the speed all the way from here to here. The speed kind of tells me how the distance is piled up. The distance is kind of a running total, where the speed",

The difference between a running total of total distance covered and a speed that's telling me at a moment, at an instant how distance is changing. The slope at this very point t, that slope is this height, is at. OK, so there you have the first-- well, I'll say the second. The first pair of calculus was this one. f equals st, and it's derivative was s. Our second pair is f is this, and will you allow me to write df dt? If f is 1/2 of at squared, then df dt is at. You'll see this rule again. The power two dropped to a power one. But the two multiplied the thing so it canceled the 1/2 and just left the a. OK, that's a start on the highlights of calculus.
