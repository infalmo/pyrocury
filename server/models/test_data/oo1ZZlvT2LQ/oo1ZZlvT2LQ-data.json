And it couldn't have come from algebra because, however we approach e to the x, there's some limiting step. Something goes to 0. Something goes to infinity. I've got different ways to reach e to the x, but all of them involve that limiting process, which we haven't discussed in full. Let me come back at a later time to the whole theory, discussion of limits and just go forward here with this highly important function. And I'd like to start with its most important property, which is-- so it has this remarkable property that its slope is equal to itself.",

Now, I have to admit that if we had a function like that, y equals e to the x, then 2e to the x, x would work just as well, or 10e to the x. Those would-- the factor 2 or the factor 10 would be in y and it would also be in the slope and it would cancel and-- this is a differential equation, our first differential equation. A differential equation is an equation that involves, as this one does, the function and the slope. It connects them. And that's the fantastic description of nature, is by differential equations. So it's great to see this one early and it's the most important one. When you get this one, you've got a whole lot of others solved. OK. But I needed to give it a starting point so that the solution would be e to the x and not 10e to the x. So where should I start it? Well if I want it to be an e to the x, then when x is 0, e to the 0 power, some number to the 0 power, is always 1.",

This has got to come out of the construction, out of this property. It's got to come-- but we want this to deserve, to be called some number to the x power. If we take some number x times multiplied by that same number capital x times, then we've got that number how many times? x plus capital x. So that's a key property to be proved. So what will I do? Let me summarize in advance, outline in advance. I'm going to construct this function from its property. Then I'm going check that it's got this property, that important equality there. Then, of course, I'll graph it. I'll figure out what e is, and I'll say something about cases",

It happens with interest, with money in a bank. When you get interest, the interest is proportional, of course, the amount there. And if they add that interest in, if you don't take it out and spend it but you compound it, put it in there, then you have more money. When they compute the interest again, it's computed on that larger amount and is more interest than the first time. And so it goes. So money in the bank is a case of exponential growth. A hedge fund grows faster than our bank account does, but all following e to the x. If you just hang on long enough, you're way up there. OK. So here's my job. Follow this rule and start at y equals 1. So can I just do it this way? Here is my function, y of x, that I want to construct. I want to build that function. And I know that it starts at 1.",

I'll have to go forever. And what will the next one be? Oh yeah. If you see the next one, then we can see the pattern. Now what am I doing? This one has to have this slope. I'm fixing the top line now. If I'm aiming for a slope of x squared, then I need some number of x cubes. So how many x cubes do I need? Well, I need to know, what's the slope of x cube? The rule for powers of x, x to the n, is n times one smaller power. The slope of x cube is 3 times x squared. So I had better divide by that 3 so that the 3 cancels the 3. Now the slope of that, the 3x squared, the threes would cancel and I would get x squared. But I'm looking for 1/2 x squared. I need also a 2. Do you see that it's 1/6 of x cube that's going to do the job. 1/6 of x cubed because the slope--",

This is called n factorial, x to the nth over n factorial, because when I take the slope of x to the nth, an n will come down. Cancel that n. x, I'll have one lower power. You see, when I take the slope of this, I'll have the n will cancel the n. So I'll still have these other guys down below. And I'll have x to the n minus 1. And that will be x to the n minus 1 over n minus 1 factorial. That will be the previous one. But now I have to add in the x to the nth over n factorial because y and dy to the x have to be the same, so I have to keep going. OK. So you might say, well, you're going to blow up. Not personally, the series. But what saves you? What saves you is the fact that these n factorials, those fractions, that n factorial gets to be really large really fast, faster than this x to nth could grow. So altogether, these terms, x to the nth over n factorial,",

It doesn't keep going, getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger as I had more terms, because what I'm adding is so small, so small. And that's the point where we have to discuss limits later. OK. So that's my construction. Construction complete. The exponential function e to the x-- this is e to the x-- is being defined by 1 plus x plus 1/2 x squared plus 6 x cubed, and so on. OK. I've got a function. Now, its property. And the key property is this one. Can I move to the next board? So the next step is, check-- well, I've asked you. I've got e to the x. And let me write again what it is. 1 plus x plus 1/2 x squared plus 1/6 x cubed and so on. And then I've got e to the any other power, or even the same",

That's my exponential series. And every time, I have to put in x plus capital x. In other words, of course, it starts with 1. Then it has the x plus capital x. And then it has the 1/2 of x plus capital x squared. And it keeps going. And I just wanted you to say, yes. I guess I hope you say yes when I ask, is this big multiplication the same as this one? Well, I think it is. Let's just start to check, anyway. The ones are good. The x and the x-- I'm really just putting parentheses around all the-- now I'm going to put parentheses around all the second degree terms and say, is that the same as that?",

So we have to remember, how do you do-- but, of course, you do remember how to multiply x plus capital x by itself. You just do the multiplications. x, when I multiply that by itself, I get x squared. With 1/2, I get that. And then, you remember? How many x times x's do I get? Little x times big x, there'd be two of those. But then the 1/2 factor leaves me with 1, and that's what I want. And then, finally, this guy by himself squared is the 1/2 capital x squared that I also want. So far, so good. Do you want to see the cubed terms? Well, I'd rather you did it, but I should at least show that I'm willing to try. So what do I mean by the cubed terms? I mean that here, I want to get-- the next one should be 1/6 of x plus x cubed. And from the multiplication, I get some separate pieces.",

But I'll finish this little line. There's also an x times 1/2 x squared. So that's 1/2 of x times the big x squared. And then there is the 1 times the 1/6 x cubed. So those are the four pieces that come, third degree, when I do the big multiplication. And they have to match the third degree term in the last line. And they do match. Do you remember the right words to say now? Binomial theorem. The binomial theorem tells you how to take the nth power all a sum like x plus capital x to the nth power. It tells you all the many pieces you get. And those many pieces are exactly the pieces that we get",

So let me now come back here, having checked that. I wanted to say something about this series, 1 plus x plus 1/2 x squared, where the typical term is x to the nth over n factorial. This is the, I would say, the second most important infinite series in mathematics, the exponential series. And it's the way I wanted to construct e to the x by matching term by term and seeing that these n factorials show up. You might want to know, what's the most important series? Reasonable question. For me, the most important series would be the one looking like this, except it doesn't have the fractions.",

Can you see this 1 plus x plus x squared plus x cubed plus x to the n? That, I think it's called the geometric series. Powers of x. Now, it's simpler because it doesn't have these fractions. But it's riskier because those fractions were making the exponential series succeed. Whereas here, with the geometric series, well, look what happens when x is 1. When x is 1, we have 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 forever. All ones. It blows up. And when x is bigger than 1, that series blows up even faster. So in this series, the geometric series, this most important one, does succeed but only when x is below 1. x equal 1 is the cutoff and it fails after that.

So let me ask you, what happens if I put x equal 1 in the exponential series? That gives me e to the first power, which is e. So finally, you may say, it's rather late in the day. i'm going to figure out what e is from this series. Put in set x equal 1 and you learn that e to the first power, which is e, is-- can I just put it in? 1 plus x is 1 plus 1/2 of 1 squared plus 1/6 of 1 cubed. What's the next term in this? So these are numbers now, and I'm getting a number. I'm getting this incredible number e, named after Euler. Euler was a fantastic mathematician. I think he wrote more important papers then any mathematician in history. So he was allowed to name this number after himself, e.",

And is more than-- well, it's certainly more than 2 1/2, because I start with 2 1/2 here. And then I add these. Well, I could even throw in 1/6. That's more than 2 2/3, would that be? If I quit here, I'd have 2 2/3. And then I get a little more. It's easy to show. No way you would reach as far as 3. These later terms are dropping too fast. And actually, the number turns out to be-- so it's 2 point something. 2 point-- let's see, a little more than 2 2/3, so it's around 2.7. But it's it's not exactly 2.7.

So I get e to the x times e to the minus x. What is that? What does that equal if I multiply e to the x times e to the minus x? As usual, I'm supposed to add these. I get 0, so I get e to the 0, which is 1. In other words, e to the minus x is 1 over e to the x, which we fully expected. So that at x equal minus 1 here, I'm down to 1 over e, 1/3, approximately. So it's going down. In this way, it's decaying very fast. It almost touches that line, but never quite. This way, it's climbing. It's growing, growing really-- well, it's growing exponentially. And that's what this graph looks like. And now I would like to connect back, at the end of this lecture, to the insurance business--",

I like this way. I like the way we did it with the infinite series. But here's another way. So suppose you're getting 100% interest. Generous bank. OK. And you start with $1 at 100% now. It's 100%. And the bank gives you interest at the end of every year. So at the end of the first year, you had $1 dollar in the bank, it adds in 100%. It adds in another dollar. So now you've got $2 in the bank after the first year. At the end of the second year, it gives you 100% of what you've got in the bank. So it gives you 2 more. It give you 4. At the end of the third year, it gives you an additional 4. You're up 50 to 8. And you see what's happening. It's the powers of two. Well, that's pretty good growth.",

You would want to ask your bank, couldn't you just, like, figure the interest a little more often and put it in there-- like, figure it every month? So what would happen if you figured the interest every month? Of course, you wouldn't get 100% interest in a month. You'd get 100% divided by 12, because we're only talking about one month. So if it was months, you start with 1. You have 1 plus 1/12. That's what you'd have after a month. Now, what would you have after 2 months and what would you have after 12 months? Well, we're going to follow the rule. They gave you the 1/12 at the end of January. So through all of February, you've got 1 plus 1/12 in there. At the end of February, they take 1/12 of that, add it in. What you get the next time is 1 plus 1/12 squared.",

You have to leave your money. I'm sorry. Plus 1/12 of it for the interest. And then twice, and after 1 year, it's done this. You see what happens after 1 year, it's multiplied 12 times. 1 plus 1/12 to the 12th power. And that's better than 2, right? You've got the 2 only when they put the interest in just once a year. Now we're speeding up the bank and getting more out of it. So I don't know exactly what 1 plus 1/12 to the 12th power is, but I know it's more than 2. And actually, I'm sure it's not more than 3. In fact, yeah, I'm claiming that it's not as much as e, 2.7. But it was worth doing, to get them to compound every month. But, of course, you think, okay, I'm on to a good thing. Every day. Why not?

In every piece, they multiply my wealth by 1 plus 1 over n. And they do it n times in a year. And the beautiful thing is that as n goes to infinity, and calculus comes in, because we're asking them to compound interest continuously, not just every month, not every day, every second even, but all the time. You don't get an infinite amount out of this. You get e. As n gets bigger, that approaches this number e. That's another way to construct e, as the limit-- you see, as n gets bigger, it's like 1 to the infinity, which is kind of meaningless. I don't want to say that 1 to the-- I had an email the other day that said, well, 1 to the infinity is e. What's happening? That's not true.

I just would like to say one thing, coming back to the very beginning here. The great differential equation, dy dx equal y. That was beautiful. Which we've now solved. Now I want to ask, what if the differential equation was dy dx is some multiple of y? How would that come up? Well, up to now, c was 1. We were getting 100% interest per year. But now, if c is sort of the interest rate, the growth rate, or the decay rate of c is negative, we may be losing money in this bank. So can I just tell you what is the solution to this differential equation? When I tell you, and we learned about taking derivatives, you'll see, of course, that's all it is.",

            "text": " It's just the solution to this one. I'll also start at one. The solution to that one is y of x is e-- e is coming in again-- to the cx. What I'm doing is like changing the rate at-- I've made the rate of chance c. And then that c is going to come up there and in the derivative, the slope of this guy, that c will come down. The slope of this will be c e to the cx, which is cy, which is what that second differential equation tells us. So that's just a comment looking ahead, that we've solved not only the most important differential equation with the most important function that calculus creates but a whole collection of related equations in which the rate can be any fixed number, c.
