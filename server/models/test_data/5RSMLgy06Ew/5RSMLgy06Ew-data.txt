PROFESSOR: OK, on Tuesday we talked about sex, so today we're going to talk about marriage. Now, in terms of graph theory, marriage is expressed as a matching problem, and today we're going to talk about a matching algorithm that is used in all sorts of applications. It's used by online dating agencies to match compatible people together. It's used for assignment problems, for example, matching interns to hospitals on match day. It's used for resource allocation problems, for example, load balancing traffic on the internet. And we'll talk about the applications at the end of class. In its simplest form of a matching problem, you have a graph where the edges represent compatibility. Two nodes can be paired together, or married, and the goal is to create the maximum number of compatible pairs. So let's define a matching, given a graph, G,",

And that means x7 and x8 would have to be in the matching, but they could only be paired with x1, and so it's not possible to do that. All right, so there is no matching of size four in this graph. Three is the best I can do. Now, when you get every node in a matching, then it's called a perfect matching. And so in this case, it doesn't exist, but sometimes it does. So a matching is perfect if it has size half the number of nodes. In other words, if the number of edges is v over 2, then every node is in the matching. All right, so that one doesn't have a perfect matching. What about this graph? So I got b1, b2, b3, b4, g1, g2, g3, g4, and I'll put in the compatibility edges here.",

Can you do that? AUDIENCE: Yes. PROFESSOR: Yeah? All right, who do I start pairing up? AUDIENCE: 1, 1. AUDIENCE: 1, 1. AUDIENCE: b2, g3. PROFESSOR: b2, g3. AUDIENCE: b3, g2. PROFESSOR: b3, g2 AUDIENCE: b4, g4. PROFESSOR: There we go. All right, so there is a perfect matching in this graph. Very good. Now, in some cases, some pairings are more desirable than others, and this can be represented with a weight. And so you might have a weighted graph where every edge has a weight on it. For example, we might weight b1, g2 with 5, and b1, g1 gets a 10. And usually when you see weighted graphs in the matching context, a lower weight means it's more desirable, so that b1 and g2 would get along better than b1 and g1. And then the goal is to find a matching with minimum weight.",

Now, usually when you're looking at weighted matchings, you require yourself to have a perfect matching so that everybody gets paired up. And often in that case, you'll see all the edges present, some of them with very big weights, maybe even infinity if they just can't be put together. Because otherwise you just say, don't match anybody together, and you have weight zero. So for when you look at minimum weight matchings, you're looking for the perfect matching with minimum weight. So we say a min-weight matching for a graph, G, is a perfect matching for G with the minimum weight, overall perfect matchings.",

What is the weight of the min weight matching in that graph? 20. And who gets paired with who there? Who does Brad get hooked up with? AUDIENCE: Jan. PROFESSOR: Jan, and that leaves Billy Bob with Angelina, and the weight is 20. So even though Brad really likes Angelina, if I go that route, my weight is 21, which is not as good. So the min-weight matching would be this one. OK. Now, it turns out that finding the maximum matching-- the maximum number of edges you can put together--",

The algorithm is run in quadratic to cubic time, so not terrible, but they're not NP-complete, so people know how to do it. Now, they are pretty complicated, so we're not going to cover them in 6042. What we're going to do is look at a slightly different version of the problem that actually turns out to be more useful in practice, because there's a very nice algorithm for it. Now, in the version of the problem that we're going to look at, everybody has preferences-- a preference list. It's not weighted, but it's a priority order of who they want to get mated to, or matched up with. So it would look not quite like that, but it would look like this. So Brad, Billy Bob, Jennifer, and Angelina-- same players, but what we do is we know that Brad really likes Angelina, and Angelina really likes Brad, so they are first choices, at least was. Number two for Brad is Jennifer, but Jennifer really likes Brad first, and Billy Bob second. Billy Bob likes Angelina first, then Jennifer.",

So it's an asymmetric situation. Now, what would happen if we set up our marriages so that Brad is married to Jen, and Billy Bob is married to Angelina? What might happen if we made those as our pairings, and we put them on a desert island, all four of them? What's likely to happen there? AUDIENCE: Brad and Angelina are going to cheat on each other. PROFESSOR: Yeah, we're going to have a problem. Because Brad and Angelina have the hots for each other here, and they like each other better than their spouse. So before you know it, they're going to be doing their 6042 homework together late at night. All right? Now, when this happens, we have what's called a rogue couple. Given a matching, x and y, a boy and a girl, say, form a rogue couple if they prefer each other",

So here, if we married Brad to Jennifer, and Billy Bob to Angelina, Brad and Angelina form a rogue couple, because they like each other better than who they were hooked up with. And that's sort of a bad thing. It creates instability if you were to make the matchings that way. In fact, we say that a matching is stable if there aren't any rogue couples. And now, one thing to make clear is that your preferences can't change over time. So it's not a situation where you get bored with your spouse, and you change your mind, and then you go off and create a rogue couple. You're fixed in your preferences over all time, no playing the field, none of that stuff here, OK? So it's fixed once and for all, and your goal, of course,",

But it's stable, because Brad and Angelina aren't going anywhere.

Technically, it's a subgraph, so it has nodes and edges, but you'll see me, and you'll see everybody say, oh, it's a bunch of edges that don't share any nodes, and you'll see them refer to it as the edges. But really, underlying that, it's a subgraph, technically. Any other questions about what we're trying to do here to find stable, perfect matching? All right. Well, in this example, there was a stable, perfect matching. But what about in general? If I have a lot more people, and they have arbitrary preferences, how many people think you can always find a stable perfect matching? There's one optimistic person. How many people think there's some cases where you're just not going to be able to do it? Wow. OK, it's a pessimistic view. Well, in some sense you're both right. If you allow boys to prefer boys and girls to prefer girls, then it is not possible, and I'll give you an example. You can find examples where there's always a rogue couple, but if you require boys to only get matched to girls and vice versa, then it is possible to always find stable marriages, stable matchings. And we're going to talk about an algorithm for that. But before I show you the algorithm, let me show you the bad case when boys can prefer boys, or what's sort of a unisex scenario.",

And their second choices go in the opposite order there, all right? So Alex wants to be with Bobby Joe. Bobby Joe wants be with Robin. Robin wants to be with Alex. And then there's Mergatoid-- [LAUGHTER] --and nobody likes Mergatoid. So that's choice three for all of them here. And Mergatoid's choices, preferences don't really matter in this case. [LAUGHTER] I hope nobody is named Mergatoid in the class. I would get complaints here. All right, so I want to claim and prove a theorem that says there is no stable matching for this group of preferences. So we'll state that as the theorem. There does not exist a stable matching for this graph. The proof is by contradiction-- assume there is one.",

Well, if there's a stable matching, Mergatoid's got to get married to somebody. Mergatoid will be matched with someone. All right. Now, here I'm going to do something that you can do in your proofs, but you've got to be careful when you do it. I'm going to say, without loss of generality, assume Mergatoid is matched to Alex, all right? And I can do that. So this is the abbreviation, without loss of generality by symmetry. And really, I should explain what I mean here in the proof. Well, that love triangle is symmetric. Each one has a preference for the next person around the triangle. In terms of graph isomorphism, with the weights on that, every node looks the same. So I can use symmetry. So we're going to say, without loss of generality,",

Any questions about that? And I'm sort of implying here that you could match, you could have had Mergatoid matched to Bobby Joe, and then Bobby Joe and Alex would have been a rogue couple, or Mergatoid matched to Robin, and then Robin and Bobby Joe would be a rogue couple by the without loss of generality. So it's OK to use that, but you want to be careful that you're doing it OK. Questions? Yeah? AUDIENCE: So the without loss of generality only works if it's, like, perfectly symmetric? PROFESSOR: Yeah. Basically, the argument you're going to make is just going to be the same argument done in all three cases, and to save yourself some effort, you're saying, don't do the three cases, do one, the other two look the same. So technically, you could add case one, case two, case three, and they would've looked symmetric. OK? All right. Now, this is not very surprising, as you all voted. Almost all of you said it's hard to find stable matchings. You might not be able to do it always. And in fact, you can't in the unisex world. The surprising thing is, you can always find a stable matching",

            "text": " in the world where boys could only be paired with girls and vice versa. Now, this statement, this result is pretty famous. The problem itself is known as the stable marriage problem. So let me just define it here, and then we'll talk about an algorithm to find the matching. So we have N boys and N girls. And it's important we have the same number of each. Now, actually, tomorrow, in recitation, you're going to look at the scenario where there's more girls than boys, or vice versa. And you'll be using a similar algorithm, but it'll be a different context, and that's the context that comes up in matching interns to hospitals, and stuff like that. But for our version it's an equal number of boys and girls. Each boy has his own ranked preference list of all the girls.",

All right, so say that's our matching problem, and those are the preference lists. Any ideas for how we might try to make an algorithm to do this? Any thoughts about what you'd do? What are some approaches we could take? Yeah? AUDIENCE: Use the mating algorithm. PROFESSOR: Use the greedy algorithm? AUDIENCE: The mating algorithm. PROFESSOR: Oh, the mating algorithm. Well, yeah, the mating algorithm is going to do very well, but I haven't told you what that is, and it's a little complicated. So I sort of want to explore the things you might know from what we've done so far. What approaches have we seen so far for solving problems? Yeah? AUDIENCE: The greedy algorithm? PROFESSOR: The greedy algorithm-- yep. And let's try that. So let's choose the first boy, and we'll just go down and give each boy the best choice available and see what happens. First thing to try usually is the greedy algorithm, and about half the time it'll work in life, and half the time it won't.",

Boy 4, oh yeah, boy 4 has got to go all the way down to B, because A, C, and D got taken, so boy 4 gets B. And boy 5-- who's left? E, fourth choice again. All right, well, maybe that's a stable matching. All right, well let's see. To see if it's stable, we've got to see are there any rogue couples. Well, is there any rogue couple involving boy 1? No, boy 1 got his first choice. You're not going anywhere. Boy 2? No-- first choice, same with boy 3. These boys are quite happy. They're not doing anything. Boy 4 may not be so happy though, because boy 4 got paired with B, so there's possible rogue couples. Let's see, is 4, A a rogue couple? No. A hates boy 4, all right? No chance she's running off with boy 4.",

C has the hots for boy 4, so she likes him better than whoever her mate was, and boy 4 likes C better than who he got matched with, boy B. That is now a rogue couple, so the greedy algorithm did not work. That's too bad. Well, it would be short lecture, I guess, if it worked. [LAUGHTER] Well, what would you do next, sort of, if you were-- I mean, you could try to match 4 with C, and then try to patch things up, and you could start doing that, but you might create other rogue couples. In fact, I don't know an approach-- yeah? AUDIENCE: You could let it evolve and see if it gets it more stable. PROFESSOR: Say it again. AUDIENCE: You could let it evolve, let all the rogue couples evolve and see if it ends up any more stable. PROFESSOR: Yes, you could start swapping around to get rid of rogue couples. In doing that, you might create other rogue couples. In fact, I don't know of an algorithm that works like this, that works, that's known to work, where you start patching things up, because as you're patching things up, you might make other things much worse by doing that. So I don't know of an approach that way. What's another approach? Yeah? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] pertaining to what order they have each other. PROFESSOR: And then do?

Also, min-weight matching, that algorithm is going to be more complicated than the one I'm going to show you, in the end. It takes more time to run. And I don't even know if it works. Like, I don't know if you can take these numbers and make weights on the edges get a min-weight matching. AUDIENCE: Could you do like a merge sort [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Oh, a merge sort, so you take the minimum weight edge, put that in, and recurse on that kind of thing. I don't know. It's possible. In fact, you know what, a recursive approach is a good idea. I don't know of a nice recursive algorithm for this. It's true that if you found a boy and a girl who liked each other best, you could then match them safely and recurse, because you know they're not going to be in a rogue couple, because they like each other best. Then you could recurse. But that might not exist here. You might not have a boy and girl that like each other best, in which case it's hard to know. I don't know now if you pick the minimum weight in some sense, like add the preference list or something to make a min-weight and recurse on that, if that works. I don't know of an approach like that. But those are the kinds of things you try. And as far as I know, all the simple things fail for this problem. But there is something that's a little more involved, but does work, and that's the mating algorithm. And does everybody have the handout? There, it's back up there. I got some copies down here if you need it, but pull that out.",

So the initial condition is you have each of the N boys has an ordered list of the N girls and vice versa, and the ritual, we're going to view this is a mating ritual, and really, the program is doing it. The code is doing it. But think of it as real life. It takes place over several days. Now, the day is broken up into three parts-- the morning, the afternoon, and the evening. In the morning, each girl comes out to her balcony and stands on the balcony. Each boy goes to the balcony of his favorite girl who is still on his list that hasn't been crossed off. Now, initially, every girl is on his list. So he goes to his favorite girl, goes under her balcony, and serenades her. Now, if, over the course of the algorithm, the boy has nobody left on his list, he's out of luck. He just stays home and does homework. All right? There's no serenade anymore for him. Now, in the afternoon, the girls who have at least one suitor-- a boy down there serenading her-- looks at all the suitors, picks her favorite, and to the favorite she says, maybe I'll marry you. Come back tomorrow. Girls don't want to make it too easy here for the boys. Now, to all the other boys who are lower priority she says, I will never marry you. Go away.",

Because, you know, it's the only practical thing to do at that point. Now, if the boy heard the maybe I'll marry you, well, he's going to go back tomorrow, because that's still his favorite girl that's not crossed off. So he goes back and serenades her again the next day in the hopes that eventually, she'll say yes. Now, we keep doing this every day, OK? And if we ever encounter a day where every girl has, at most, one suitor, the algorithm stops, and then every girl who has a suitor says, yes, I will marry you. Now, if a girl doesn't have a suitor, there's no one to marry her. We're going to prove that doesn't happen, OK? But determination condition is, you no longer have a situation with two or more boys under one balcony. OK? All right, so let's run that algorithm on this example, just so we make sure we understand it, because I'm going to try to prove theorems about it. So here are the serenades that are going on, and here's the girls, and the days. It's going to work over four days in this case.",

That is a possibility, so I've got to say what would happen in that possibility. Now, we will prove in a few minutes that condition never arises, OK? But I'm giving you what might happen, in which so it never does, so no boy ends up having to stay home and do homework here. All right, so that's the algorithm. Now let's see if we can see if there's any rogue couples. All right, so, for example, let's look at boy 1. Boy 1 got paired to his third choice, E, so 1, C might be a rogue couple. Is that possible? No, because C got 4 here, which is her first choice. She's not going with boy 1. That's not working. What about 1, B? Could that be rogue? No, B got 2, and B likes 2 better than 1, so 1, C and 1, B are not rogue. And 1 got E, so there's no other possibility for boy 1, so boy 1 is not in a rogue couple.",

All right, boy 3-- boy 3 got his first choice, right? 3 got D, so 3 is not going anywhere. Boy 4 got-- who did boy 4 get-- got C. 4 got his second choice. What about 4, A? A hates 4. A is not gonna get caught dead with 4, so that's not rogue. So 4 is OK. 4 is not in a rogue couple. And finally, boy 5-- boy 5 is paired with A, and that is boy 5's first choice, so he's not wandering off here. All right? So in fact, we've just argued that this is a stable set of marriages, a stable matching in this case. Any questions now about what we're trying to do?

Is this algorithm good for girls, or good for boys? Yeah, that's a good point-- fairness. All right, so we'll take a look at fairness also. Is it better to be a serenader, or be on the balcony making your choices? OK, so this is what we've got to do. So let's start by showing TMA terminates, and that it terminates pretty quickly.

This is probably the only day where we'll do a bunch of proofs and none of them use induction. They're pretty much all by contradiction. Suppose TMA does not terminate in N squared plus 1 days, because we're going to show that leads to a contradiction. We need to show that some kind of progress is made each day to show that it terminates. Yeah? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the number of causes that have [INAUDIBLE], so if it has not terminated, then at least one girl is seeing a group of at least one guy-- PROFESSOR: Yes. AUDIENCE: --so the number of crosses cannot be defined [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Very good. OK, let's state that as a claim, and you've given the proof of the claim, which is great.

So every day we don't terminate, a boy crossed a girl off his list, so if we didn't terminate at N squared plus 1 days, we must have crossed off N squared plus 1 girls across all the lists.

So as she rejects boys, she only does that because she's got better ones there, and whoever she says maybe to always comes back. So an invariant of this algorithm is that when a girl has a suitor, going forward, she only has suitors she likes at least as well. And if she ever rejects a boy, then she's got somebody better there forever. All right, so let's state that as an invariant and prove that. OK, so we're going to let P be our invariant here. P is the statement that if a girl, G, ever rejected a boy, B, then the girl, G, has a suitor, or if the algorithm is terminated, a husband who she prefers to B. All right,",

What's the first one? AUDIENCE: Base case? PROFESSOR: Base case. Show it holds true at the beginning. Proof is going to be by induction, and so we've got to show that P holds true at the beginning. But what are we going to induct on here? What's the parameter we're inducting on? AUDIENCE: Time? PROFESSOR: Time, the number of days. Good. The base case is day zero, the beginning. All right. Well, is that statement true on day zero? Yeah, it's true for sort of a weird reason. Nobody's been rejected yet, so it's what's called vacuously true.

So we'll assume P holds at the end of day d, and we need to argue that it holds now at the end of day d plus 1. So say it's true up to now, up to day d. Why Is it true at the end of the next day? Well, there's two cases to look at here, depending on when G rejected B. So if she rejects B on this day, day d plus 1, well, why would she reject B on day d plus 1? There's only one scenario. Yeah?

G rejected B before day d, before d plus 1. Well, now we use the fact that P was true at the end of day d, which means P now implies that G had at least as good a suitor. Actually, it's better, because it was rejected. A better suitor on day d, that's what the hypothesis says, the invariant says. And now we just have to look at what happens on d plus 1. Well, either she has the same suitor on d plus 1, or somebody better came along.",

And he'd be getting married, because it's the end. So this means that if B is not married, he's rejected by everybody. Yeah? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] list? PROFESSOR: Oh, he's on everybody's list. AUDIENCE: Yeah. PROFESSOR: Everybody has everybody of the opposite sex on their list, but he had to cross everybody off. That's true. Yeah? AUDIENCE: That would mean that everyone had somebody better on the same day that [INAUDIBLE] telling him she didn't want to be with him. PROFESSOR: That's true. That means that B crossed every girl off. B is rejected by every girl, which means every girl has somebody better than B, which is not possible, because that would mean every girl was married. And therefore, the equal number of boys and girls, that means B",

OK, that means that every girl, by lemma 1, has a better suitor, and that's where we use lemma 1. And that means that every girl is married, and that means that every boy is married, including B, and that's a contradiction, because we said B wasn't married. OK? Everybody buy that proof? Any questions about that? Yeah, proof by contradiction is a pretty powerful technique. Once you assume something is not going to be true, it gives you a lot of power to find a contradiction. All right, so now we know that the algorithm ends, and everybody gets married. All's we got to do is show that there's no rogue couples,",

So let Bob and Gail be any pair that are not married. I need to prove the Bob and Gail are not rogue, and then we'll be fine. Because if it says everybody who is not married is not rogue, then we know we have a stable matching. Now, there's a couple of cases here. Bob and Gail weren't married, so there's two ways that could have happened. What's one of them? What's one reason they might not be married, something that happened that made that impossible? Yeah?

We actually proved it works. One issue left to think about here. Any questions on that before we launch off into the last issue? AUDIENCE: Is it unique? PROFESSOR: Is it unique? TMA gives you a unique answer because it's an algorithm. It's deterministic. But there may be other stable matchings. OK, so there's not just one stable matching, necessarily. You could make examples with multiple stable matchings. That's a great question. Any other questions? All right. Oh, yeah? AUDIENCE: Is there generally any other way to assess optimality besides the fact that it's stable, or-- PROFESSOR: Yeah, you can make up lots of them. You could put weights on the edges and get a min-weight matching. You could try to get the perfect matching",

This one turns out to be useful in practice in a variety ways that we'll talk about, and also have a nice, fast, simple algorithm that can actually run in a distributed environment, which is really nice. So it is probably the most practical approach to matching out there. Any other questions? OK, the last issue-- I don't know if we still have the issues up there-- is fairness. So who thinks the TMA is favorable to the boys? Just a couple. Who thinks it's favorable to the girls? More, that's the common response. Who thinks you can't even define it one way or the other? It's unclear and hopeless to decide. OK, well, it seems like maybe the girls, because they get the best of their suitors. They sit back, and they just take the best as they come along. On the other hand, the boys do try to go out and get their first choice. The girls have to wait. And Mr. Right may never come along. The boys are out there. I'm going to my first choice, and they get denied, OK, they just move right on to the next choice. So this is actually one of these questions of study in sociology. In the animal species, which is better, proposers or acceptors?",

And the answer is the boys have all the power here. This is very favorable to the boys, and we'll see why. Now, to prove that, we need some definitions. OK, so I've got to define a couple things here to be able to prove this. The first is, for any collection of preference lists, we're going to let S be the set of all stable matchings. Now, we know that S is not empty, right? How do we know that S is not empty here? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] stable. PROFESSOR: Yeah, because TMA produces a stable matching, so we know that S is not empty. There's at least one. And, in fact, there could be many. Now, for each person, P, we define the realm of possibility",

All right. Now, Brad is not realistic for Jen. Brad Is not in Jen's realm of possibility, because in any perfect matching where Brad marries Jen, you're going to have a rogue couple. Brad's going to go for Angelina. So Brad is not within Jen's realm of possibility. And similarly, vice versa-- Jen is not in Brad's realm of possibility, because there's no stable matching where they're married, in this scenario, for this problem. All right? Now that we have that notion, we can define who your optimal mate is, and who your pessimal mate is, the worst case. All right, so we define a person's optimal mate",

So your optimal mate is not your favorite overall, it's just your favorite among those who are possible, that there is a stable matching that you could be matched to that person. And similarly, you have a person's pessimal mate is your least favorite from the realm of possibility. OK? Because you have all the people you might be married to in stable matchings. Your favorite is the optimal, your least favorite is the pessimal. Any questions about that? Does that make sense? And you don't count the ones you can't be married to, because if you were, it would be unstable. OK, now we can state the blockbuster theorems here.

They get the best possible they could have in stable marriages, and every girl gets the worst possible mate. Now, you wouldn't necessarily think that when you first look at that algorithm, where the boys are working down their list, and the girls are just getting better and better. But that's the case. Now, let's see, I'm not going to have time to prove them both, but I will prove theorem five. And I'm going to assume theorem four is true to prove theorem five. Maybe we'll do theorem four tomorrow in recitation. I don't know. So let's do theorem five so you can see how this works. The proof is by contradiction, so we'll assume theorem four is true, and we'll prove the proof of theorem five by contradiction.",

Theorem four says that across all the stable matchings, B gets his favorite mate in TMA. So G prime is in the realm of possibility, and so is G, and we know from theorem four B likes G best, better than G prime, because of theorem four. So what happened here? There's a rogue couple in M.

Everybody lives happily ever after, especially the boys in TMA. Now, TMA arises in lots of applications. The most famous is the matching program that's used to match MDs to residency programs. So how many pre-meds are here? There's one, at least. So you're going to go to medical school some day, and at the end of medical school, there's a big day called match day, where you get assigned to a hospital for your internship, and the way that works is using this algorithm. And who do you suppose is the boy in this algorithm? AUDIENCE: The hospital. PROFESSOR: The hospital. And they want it so that when they make the matchings, that there's not some pair of an intern or doctor in a hospital where they'd like each other better than what they got. This is used in online dating for the obvious reasons, and we actually use this algorithm lot at Akamai to load balance traffic on the web. And here you have the boys are web servers, and the girls are requests for service. And the goals are to balance performance, getting a server that's nearby you that's fast. And on the other side, our cost, and by who we make a boy and a girl, we can trade off cost for performance",
