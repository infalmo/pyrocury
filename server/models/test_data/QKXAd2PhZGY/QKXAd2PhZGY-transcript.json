this limit", "start": 207.46, "duration": 2.35}, {"text": "without L'Hospital's Rule, so\nwe want to look at the limit", "start": 209.81, "duration": 2.71}, {"text": "as x goes to infinity of x\nplus

is getting big and x", "start": 219.07, "duration": 5.16}, {"text": "is getting big and\nwhat's cosine x doing?", "start": 224.23, "duration": 2.23}, {"text": "Well cosine x is behaving\nlike a

231.62, "duration": 2.62}, {"text": "but, you know, it's\noscillating, but it's", "start": 234.24, "duration": 1.96}, {"text": "in some bounded interval\nthere, whereas x and x are both", "start":

243.76, "duration": 5.22}, {"text": "us to quantify that explicitly.", "start": 248.98, "duration": 2.42}, {"text": "And so one thing\nthat we can do is", "start": 251.4, "duration": 1.84}, {"text": "we can divide top and\nbottom of this limit by x.", "start": 253.24, "duration": 3.63}, {"text": "So if we do that, or\nequivalently we can just", "start": 256.87, "duration": 2.55}, {"text": "divide this x into\nthe fraction above,", "start": 259.42, "duration": 3.18}, {"text": "split it into two fractions.", "start": 262.6, "duration": 1.45}, {"text": "So we have-- I'm just going\nto re-write it

288.56, "duration": 1.55}, {"text": "Well, all I've done is I've\ndivided that x in-- and now you", "start": 290.11, "duration": 3.83}, {"text": "see that this 1, that was\nfrom the x over x, so that's", "start": 293.94, "duration": 2.65}, {"text": "a constant that's going to 1.", "start": 296.59, "duration": 1.43}, {"text": "And as x goes to\ninfinity, cosine x-- again", "start": 298.02,

1.374}, {"text": "x over x is going to 0\nas x goes to infinity.", "start": 304.37, "duration": 6.02}, {"text": "So I guess I wouldn't\ncall this plugging in,", "start": 310.39, "duration": 1.86},

2.48}, {"text": "OK, so we can evaluate\nthis limit fairly easily.", "start": 320.53, "duration": 3.34}, {"text": "It just took a couple steps.", "start": 323.87, "duration": 1.57}, {"text": "But we can't evaluate it\nwith L'Hospital's Rule.", "start": 325.44, "duration": 2.45}, {"text": "So this is why you have that\nextra thing in the statement", "start": 327.89, "duration": 4.52}, {"text": "of the theorem that Professor\nJerison kept saying,", "start": 332.41, "duration": 2.61}, {"text": "and that I'll say\nevery time I use it,", "start": 335.02, "duration": 2.11}, {"text": "which is L'Hospital's Rule says\nthat the limit of the ratio", "start": 337.13, "duration": 3.294}, {"text": "is equal to the limit of\nthe ratio of the derivative", "start": 340.424, "duration": 2.166},
