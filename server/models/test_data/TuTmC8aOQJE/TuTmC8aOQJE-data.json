PROFESSOR: Today we're going to study stochastic processes and, among them, one type of it, so discrete time. We'll focus on discrete time. And I'll talk about what it is right now. So a stochastic process is a collection of random variables indexed by time, a very simple definition. So we have either-- let's start from 0-- random variables like this, or we have random variables given like this. So a time variable can be discrete, or it can be continuous. These ones, we'll call discrete-time stochastic processes, and these ones continuous-time.",

And then a continuous-time random variable-- a continuous-time stochastic process can be something like that. And it doesn't have to be continuous, so it can jump and it can jump and so on. And all these values are random values. So that's just a very informal description.

Your path just says f(t) equals t. And we're only looking at t greater than or equal to 0 here. So that's number 1. Number 2, it's either this one or this one. So it is a stochastic process. If you think about it this way, it doesn't really look like a stochastic process. But under the alternative definition, you have two possible paths that you can take. You either take this path, with 1/2, or this path, with 1/2. Now, at each point, t, your value X(t) is a random variable. It's either t or minus t. And it's the same for all t. But they are dependent on each other. So if you know one value, you automatically know all the other values. And the third one is even more interesting. Now, for each t, we get rid of this dependency. So what you'll have is these two lines going on.",

But if you really want draw the picture, it will bounce back and forth, up and down, infinitely often, and it'll just look like two lines. So I hope this gives you some feeling about stochastic processes, I mean, why we want to describe it in terms of this language, just a tiny bit. Any questions? So, when you look at a process, when you use a stochastic process to model a real life something going on, like a stock price, usually what happens is you stand at time t. And you know all the values in the past-- know. And in the future, you don't know. But you want to know something about it. You want to have some intelligent conclusion, intelligent information about the future, based on the past. For this stochastic process, it's easy. No matter where you stand at, you exactly know what's going to happen in the future. For this one, it's also the same. Even though it's random, once you know what happened at some point, you know it has to be this distribution or this line, if it's here, and this line if it's there. But that one is slightly different. No matter what you know about the past,",

We know that each value has to be t or minus t. You just don't know what it is. So when you're given a stochastic process and you're standing at some time, your future, you don't know what the future is, but most of the time you have at least some level of control given by the probability distribution. Here, it was, you can really determine the line. Here, because of probability distribution, at each point, only gives t or minus t, you know that each of them will be at least one of the points, but you don't know more than that. So the study of stochastic processes is, basically, you look at the given probability distribution, and you want to say something intelligent about the future as t goes on. So there are three types of questions that we mainly study here. So (a), first type, is what are the dependencies in the sequence of values. For example, if you know the price",

            "text": " So that's was an introduction. Any questions? Then there are really lots of stochastic processes. One of the most important ones is the simple random walk. So today, I will focus on discrete-time stochastic processes. Later in the course, we'll go on to continuous-time stochastic processes. And then you'll see like Brownian motions and-- what else-- Ito's lemma and all those things will appear later. Right now, we'll study discrete time. And later, you'll see that it's really just-- what is it-- they're really parallel. So this simple random walk, you'll see the corresponding thing in continuous-time stochastic processes later. So I think it's easier to understand discrete-time processes, that's why we start with it. But later, it will really help if you understand it well. Because for continuous time, it will just carry over all the knowledge. What is a simple random walk?",

Then at time 2, depending on your value of Y2, you will either go up one step from here or go down one step from there. Let's say we went up again, down, 4, up, up, something like that. And it continues. Another way to look at it-- the reason we call it a random walk is, if you just plot your values of X_t, over time, on a line, then you start at 0, you go to the right, right, left, right, right, left, left, left. So the trajectory is like a walk you take on this line, but it's random. And each time you go to the right or left, right or left, right or left. So that was two representations. This picture looks a little bit more clear. Here, I just lost everything I draw. Something like that is the trajectory.",

For example, if you apply central limit theorem to the sequence, what is the information you get? So over a long time, let's say t is way, far away, like a huge number, a very large number, what can you say about the distribution of this at time t? AUDIENCE: Is it close to 0? PROFESSOR: Close to 0. But by close to 0, what do you mean? There should be a scale. I mean some would say that 1 is close to 0. Some people would say that 100 is close to 0, so do you have some degree of how close it will be to 0? Anybody? AUDIENCE: So variance will be small. PROFESSOR: Sorry? AUDIENCE: The variance will be small. PROFESSOR: Variance will be small. About how much will the variance be? AUDIENCE: 1 over n. PROFESSOR: 1 over n. 1 over n? AUDIENCE: Over t. PROFESSOR: 1 over t? Anybody else want to have a different? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: 1 over square root t probably would. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. AUDIENCE: The variance would be [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: Oh, you're right, sorry. Variance will be 1 over t.",

PROFESSOR: Yeah, very, very different. I was confused. Sorry about that. The reason is because X_t, 1 over the square root of t times X_t-- we saw last time that this, if t is really, really large, this is close to the normal distribution, 0,1. So if you just look at it, X_t over the square root of t will look like normal distribution. That means the value, at t, will be distributed like a normal distribution, with mean 0 and variance square root of t. So what you said was right. It's close to 0. And the scale you're looking at is about the square root of t. So it won't go too far away from 0. That means, if you draw these two curves, square root of t",

            "text": " it might be the case that you always play in the negative region. But there's a theorem saying that that's not the case. With probability 1, if you go to infinity, you will cross this line infinitely often. And in fact, you will meet these two lines infinitely often. So those are some interesting things about simple random walk. Really, there are lot more interesting things, but I'm just giving an overview, in this course, now. Unfortunately, I can't talk about all of these fun stuffs. But let me still try to show you some properties and one nice computation on it. So some properties of a random walk, first, expectation of X_k is equal to 0. That's really easy to prove. Second important property is called independent increment. So if look at these times, t_0, t_1, up to t_k, then random variables X sub t_i+1 minus X sub t_i are",

And simple random walk is like the fundamental stochastic process. So let's try to see one interesting problem about simple random walk. So example, you play a game. It's like a coin toss game. I play with, let's say, Peter. So I bet $1 at each turn. And then Peter tosses a coin, a fair coin. It's either heads or tails. If it's heads, he wins. He wins the $1. If it's tails, I win. I win $1. So from my point of view, in this coin toss game, at each turn my balance goes up by $1 or down by $1.",

In other words, I look at the random walk, I look at the first time that it hits either this line or it hits this line, and then I stop. What is the probability that I will stop after winning $100?

So it should be 1/4 here, 1/2 times 1/2. You've got a good intuition. It is 1/3, actually. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: And then once you hit it, it's like the same afterwards? I'm not sure if there is a way to make an argument out of it. I really don't know. There might be or there might not be. I'm not sure. I was thinking of a different way. But yeah, there might be a way to make an argument out of it. I just don't see it right now. So in general, if you put a line B and a line A, then probability of hitting B first is A over A plus B. And the probability of hitting this line-- minus A-- is B over A plus B. And so, in this case, if it's 100 and 50, it's 100 over 150, that's 2/3 and that's 1/3.",

And then actually, there's one recursive formula that matters to us. If you start at f(k), you either go up or go down. You go up with probability 1/2. You go down with probability 1/2. And now it starts again. Because of this-- which one is it-- stationary property. So starting from here, the probability that you hit B first is exactly f of k plus 1. So if you go up, the probability that you hit B first is f of k plus 1. If you go down, it's f of k minus 1. And then that gives you a recursive formula with two boundary values. If you look at it, you can solve it. When you solve it, you'll get that answer. So I won't go into details, but what I wanted to show is that simple random walk is really this property, these two properties. It has these properties and even more powerful properties. So it's really easy to control.",

From the practical point of view, you'll have to twist some things slightly and so on. But in many cases, you can approximate it by simple random walk. And as you can see, you can do computations, with simple random walk, by hand. So that was it. I talked about the most important example of stochastic process. Now, let's talk about more stochastic processes. The second one is called the Markov chain. Let me write that part, actually. So Markov chain, unlike the simple random walk, is not a single stochastic process. A stochastic process is called a Markov chain",

So simple random walk, let's say you went like that. Then what happens after time t really just depends on how high this point is at. What happened before doesn't matter at all. Because we're just having new coin tosses every time. But this value can affect the future, because that's where you're going to start your process from.

Probability that X_(t+1) equal to s, given-- t is equal to 1/2, if s is equal X_t plus 1, or X_t minus 1, and 0 otherwise. So it really depends only on the last value of X_t. Any questions? All right. If there is case when you're looking at a stochastic process, a Markov chain, and all X_i have values in some set S, which is finite, a finite set, in that case, it's really easy to describe Markov chains.",

That's because a future state only depends on the current state. So if you know what happens at time t, where it's at time t, you look at the matrix, you can decode all the information you want. What is the probability that it will be at-- let's say, it's at 0 right now. What's the probability that it will jump to 1 at the next time? Just look at 0 comma 1, here. There is no 0, 1, here, so it's 1 and 2. Just look at 1 and 2, 1 and 2, i and j. Actually, I made a mistake. That should be the right one. Not only that, that's a one-step. So what happened is it describes what happens in a single step, the probability that you jump from i to j. But using that, you can also model what's the probability that you jump from i to j in two steps. So let's define q sub i, j as the probability",

Multiplication? Very good. So it's A square. Why is it? So let me write this down in a different way. q_(i,j) is, you sum over all intermediate values the probability that you jump from i to k, first, and then the probability that you jump from k to j. And if you look at what this means, each entry here is described by a linear-- what is it-- the dot product of a column and a row. And that's exactly what occurs. And if you want to look at the three-step, four-step, all you have to do is just multiply it again and again",

For random walk, simple random walk, I told you that it is a Markov chain. But it does not have a transition probability matrix, because the state space is not finite. So be careful. However, finite Markov chains, really, there's one matrix that describes everything. I mean, I said it like it's something very interesting. But if you think about it, you just wrote down all the probabilities. So it should describe everything. So an example. You have a machine, and it's broken or working at a given day.",

So that will be-- that times [1,  0] will be the probability [p, q]. p will be the probability that it's working at that time. q will be the probability that it's broken at that time.

They should be about the same. Let's make that assumption. I don't know if it's true or not. Well, I know it's true, but that's what I'm telling you. Under that assumption, now you can solve what p and q are. So approximately, I hope, p, q-- so A^3650 * [1, 0] is approximately the same as A to the 3651, [1, 0]. That means that this is [p, q]. [p, q] is about the same as A times [p, q]. Anybody remember what this is? Yes. So [p, q] will be the eigenvector of this matrix. Over a long period of time, the probability distribution that you will observe will be the eigenvector. And whats the eigenvalue? 1, at least in this case, it looks like it's 1.",

So there is a largest eigenvalue, which is positive and real. And there is an all-positive eigenvector corresponding to it. What I'm trying to say is that's going to be your [p, q]. But let me not jump to the conclusion yet. And one more thing we know is, by Perron-Frobenius, there exists an eigenvalue, the largest one, lambda greater than 0, and eigenvector [v 1, v 2], where [v 1, v 2] are positive. Moreover, lambda was at multiplicity 1. I'll get back to it later. So let's write this down.",

Yeah, so everybody, it should have been flipped in the beginning. So that's 8. So sum these two values, and you get lambda times [v 1, v 2]. On the left, what you get is v_1 plus v_2, you sum two coordinates. On the left, you get v_1 plus v_2. On the right, you get lambda times v_1 plus v_2. That means your lambda is equal to 1.",

So what you'll find here will be the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue-- eigenvector will be the one corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, which is equal to 1. And that's something very general. It's not just about this matrix and this special example. In general, if you have a transition matrix, if you're given a Markov chain and given a transition matrix, Perron-Frobenius theorem guarantees that there exists a vector as long as all the entries are positive. So in general, if transition matrix of a Markov chain has positive entries, then there exists a vector pi_1 up to pi_m such that-- I'll just call it v-- Av is equal to v. And that will be the long-term behavior as explained. Over a long term, if it converges to some state, it has to satisfy that. And by Perron-Frobenius theorem, we",

The other eigenvalues in the matrix are smaller than 1. And so when you take products of the transition probability matrix, those eigenvalues that are smaller than 1 scale after repeated multiplication to 0. So in the limit, they're 0, but until you get to the limit, you still have them. Essentially, that kind of behavior is transitionary behavior that dissipates. But the behavior corresponding to the stationary distribution persists. PROFESSOR: But, as you mentioned, this argument seems to be giving that all lambda has to be 1, right? Is that your point? You're right. I don't see what the problem is right now. I'll think about it later. I don't want to waste my time on trying to find what's wrong. But the conclusion is right. There will be a unique one and so on. Now let me make a note here.",

So what we have here is, at time t, if you look at what's going to happen at time t plus 1, take the expectation, then it has to be exactly equal to the value of X_t. So we have this stochastic process, and, at time t, you are at X_t. At time t plus 1, lots of things can happen. It might go to this point, that point, that point, or so on. But the probability distribution is designed so that the expected value over all these are exactly equal to the value at X_t. So it's kind of centered at X_t, centered meaning in the probabilistic sense. The expectation is equal to that. So if your value at time t was something else, your values at time t plus 1 will be centered at this value instead of that value.

I just made it up to show that there are many possible ways that a stochastic process can be a martingale. So if Y_i are IID random variables such that Y_i is equal to 2, with probability 1/3, and 1/2 is probability 2/3, then let X_0 equal 1 and X_k equal. Then that is a martingale. So at each step, you'll either multiply by 2 or 1/2 by 2-- just divide by 2. And the probability distribution is given as 1/3 and 2/3. Then X_k is a martingale. The reason is-- so you can compute the expected value.",

But this is designed so that the expected value is equal to 1. So it's a martingale. I mean it will fluctuate a lot, your balance, double, double, double, half, half, half, and so on. But still, in expectation, you will always maintain. I mean the expectation at all time is equal to 1, if you look at it from the beginning. You look at time 1, then the expected value of X_1 and so on. Any questions on definition or example? So the random walk is an example which is both Markov chain and martingale. But these two concepts are really two different concepts.",

And there are somethings which are both, like a simple random walk. There are some stuff which are not either of them. They really are just two separate things. Let me conclude with one interesting theorem about martingales. And it really enforces your intuition, at least intuition of the definition, that martingale is a fair game. It's called optional stopping theorem. And I will write it down more formally later, but the message is this. If you play a martingale game, if it's a game you play and it's your balance, no matter what strategy you use, your expected value cannot be positive or negative. Even if you try to lose money so hard, you won't be able to do that. Even if you try to win money so hard, like try to invent something really, really cool and ingenious, you should not be able to win money.",

So if you're playing a martingale game, then you're not supposed to win or lose, at least in expectation. So before stating the theorem, I have to define what a stopping point means. So given a stochastic process, a non-negative integer valued random variable tau is called a stopping time, if, for all integer k greater than or equal to 0, tau, lesser or equal to k, depends only on X_1 to X_k.",

So it will it be 0, 1, 2, or so on. That means it will be some time index. And if you look at the event that tau is less than or equal to k-- so if you want to look at the events when you stop at time less than or equal to k, your decision only depends on the events up to k, on the value of the stochastic process up to time k. In other words, if this is some strategy you want to use-- by strategy I mean some strategy that you stop playing at some point. You have a strategy that is defined as you play some k rounds, and then you look at the outcome. You say, OK, now I think it's in favor of me. I'm going to stop. You have a pre-defined set of strategies. And if that strategy only depends on the values of the stochastic process up to right now, then it's a stopping time. If it's some strategy that depends on future values, it's not a stopping time. Let me show you by example. Remember that coin toss game which had random walk value, so",

            "text": " you're going to stop. That's not a stopping time. Not a stopping time. To see formally why it's the case, first of all, if you want to decide if it's a peak or not at time t, you have to refer to the value at time t plus 1. If you're just looking at values up to time t, you don't know if it's going to be a peak or if it's going to continue. So the event that you stop at time t depends on t plus 1 as well, which doesn't fall into this definition. So that's what we're trying to distinguish by defining a stopping time. In these cases it was clear, at the time, you know if you have to stop or not. But if you define your stopping time in this way and not a stopping time, if you define tau in this way, your decision depends on future values of the outcome. So it's not a stopping time under this definition. Any questions? Does it make sense? Yes? AUDIENCE: Could you still have tau as the stopping time, if you were referring to t, and then t minus 1 was greater than [INAUDIBLE]? PROFESSOR: So. AUDIENCE: Let's say, yeah, it was [INAUDIBLE]. PROFESSOR: So that time after peak, the first time after peak? AUDIENCE: Yes. PROFESSOR: Yes, that will be a stopping time. So three, tau is tau_0 plus 1, where tau 0 is the first peak,",

So no matter what strategy you use, if you're a mortal being, then you cannot win. That's the content of this theorem. So I wanted to prove it, but I'll not, because I think I'm running out of time. But let me show you one, very interesting corollary of this applied to that number one. So number one is a stopping time. It's not clear that there is a bounded time where you always stop before that time. But this theorem does apply to that case. So I'll just forget about that technical issue. So corollary, it applies not immediately, but it does apply to the first case, case 1 given above. And then what it says is expectation of X_tau is equal to 0. But expectation of X_tau is-- X at tau is either 100 or negative 50, because they're always going to stop at the first time where you either hit $100 or minus $50.",

You know it's set. It's equal to 0. What it gives is-- I hope it gives me the right thing I'm thinking about. p, 100, yes. It's 150p minus 50 equals 0. p is 1/3. And if you remember, that was exactly the computation we got. So that's just a neat application. But the content of this, it's really interesting. So try to contemplate about it, something very philosophically. If something can be modeled using martingales, perfectly, if it really fits into the mathematical formulation of a martingale, then you're not supposed to win. So that's it for today. And next week, Peter will give wonderful lectures. See you next week.",
