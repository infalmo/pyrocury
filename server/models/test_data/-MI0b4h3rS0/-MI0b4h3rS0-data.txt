PROFESSOR: Today we're moving on from theoretical things, from the mean value theorem, to the introduction to what's going to occupy us for the whole rest of the course, which is integration. So, in order to introduce that subject, I need to introduce for you a new notation, which is called differentials. I'm going to tell you what a differential is, and we'll get used to using it over time. If you have a function which is y = f(x), then the differential of y is going to be denoted dy, and it's by definition f'(x) dx.",

And Leibniz perfected the idea of dealing with these intuitively. And subsequently, mathematicians use them all the time. They're way more effective than the notation that Newton used. You might think that notations are a small matter, but they allow you to think much faster, sometimes. When you have the right names and the right symbols for everything. And in this case it made it very big difference. Leibniz's notation was adopted on the continent and Newton dominated in Britain and, as a result, the British fell behind by one or two hundred years in the development of calculus. It was really a serious matter. So it's really well worth your while to get used to this idea of ratios. And it comes up all over the place, both in this class and also in multivariable calculus. It's used in many contexts. So first of all, just to go a little bit easy. We'll illustrate it by its use in linear approximations, which we've already done.",

And we go forward a little increment to a place which is dx further along. The idea of this notation is that dx is going to replace the symbol delta x, which is the change in x. And we won't think too hard about-- well, this is a small quantity, this is a small quantity, we're not going to think too hard about what that means. Now, similarly, if you see how much we've gone up - well, this is kind of low, so it's a small bit here. So this distance here is, previously we called it delta y. But now we're just going to call it dy. So dy replaces delta y. So this is the change in level of the function. And we'll represent it symbolically this way. Very frequently, this just saves a little bit of notation.",

And he would just have drawn it with this. So this distance here is dx and this distance here is dy. So for an example of linear approximation, we'll say what's 64.1, say, to the 1/3 power, approximately equal to? Now, I'm going to carry this out in this new notation here. The function involved is x^1/3. And then it's a differential, dy. Now, I want to use this rule to get used to it. Because this is what we're going to be doing all of today is, we're differentiating, or taking the differential of y. So that is going to be just the derivative. That's 1/3 x^(-2/3) dx. And now I'm just going to fill in exactly what this is. At x = 64, which is the natural place close by where it's easy to do the evaluations, we have y = 64^(1/3), which is just 4.",

Because really, the dy that I'm determining here is determined by this linear relation. dy = 1/48 dx. And so this is only approximately true. Because what's really true is that this is equal to y + delta y. In our previous notation. So this is in disguise. What this is equal to. And that's the only approximately equal to what the linear approximation would give you. So, really, even though I wrote dy is this increment here, what it really is if dx is exactly that, is it's the amount it would go up if you went straight up the tangent line. So I'm not going to do that because that's not what people write. And that's not even what they think. They're really thinking of both dx and dy as being infinitesimally small. And here we're going to the finite level and doing it. So this is just something you have to live with, is a little ambiguity in this notation. This is the approximation. And now I can just calculate these numbers here.",

Now, let's just compare it to our previous notation. This will serve as a review of, if you like, of linear approximation. But what I want to emphasize is that these things are supposed to be the same. Just that it's really the same thing. It's just a different notation for the same thing.

No, 1/48. OK, that's the same calculation as before. And then our relationship becomes x^(1/3) is approximately equal to 4 plus 1/48 times x minus a, which is 64. So look, every single number that I've written over here has a corresponding number for this other method. And now if I plug in the value we happen to want, which is the 64.1, this would be 4 + 1/48 1/10,",

It's one that we haven't discussed yet. Namely, the notation that I want to describe here is what's called the integral of g(x) dx. And I'll denote that by a function capital G of x.

And another name for the antiderivative of g is the indefinite integral of g. And I'll explain to you why it's indefinite in just-- very shortly here. Well, so let's carry out some examples. Basically what I'd like to do is as many examples along the lines of all the derivatives that we derived at the beginning of the course. In other words, in principle you want to be able to integrate as many things as possible. We're going to start out with the integral of sin x dx.",

            "text": " That's a function whose derivative is sin x. So what function would that be? Cosine x, minus, right. It's -cos x. So -cos x differentiated gives you sin x. So that is an antiderivative of sine. And it satisfies this property. So this function, G(x) = - cos x, has the property that its derivative is sin x. On the other hand, if you differentiate a constant, you get 0. So this answer is what's called indefinite. Because you can also add any constant here. And the same thing will be true. So, c is constant. And as I said, the integral is called indefinite. So that's an explanation for this modifier in front of the \"integral\". It's indefinite because we actually didn't specify a single function. We don't get a single answer. Whenever you take the antiderivative of something it's ambiguous up to a constant.",

And if you think about it, what you should be differentiating is one power larger than that. But then you have to divide by 1/(a+1), in order that the differentiation be correct. So this just is the fact that d/dx of x^(a+1), or maybe I should even say it this way. Maybe I'll do it in differential notation. d(x^(a+1)) = (a+1) x^a dx. So if I divide that through by a+1, then I get the relation above. And because this is ambiguous up to a constant, it could be any additional constant added to that function. Now, the identity that I wrote down below is correct. But this one is not always correct.",

So this is only true when a is not equal to -1. And in fact, of course, what's happening when a = 0, you're getting 0 when you differentiate the constant. So there's a third case that we have to carry out. Which is the exceptional case, namely the integral of dx/x. And this time, if we just think back to what our-- So what we're doing is thinking backwards here, which a very important thing to do in math at all stages. We got all of our formulas, now we're reading them backwards. And so this one, you may remember, is ln x.

Which is that you can also get the correct formula when x is negative. And that turns out to be this one here. So I'm treating the case, x positive, as being something that you know. But let's check the case, x negative. In order to check the case x negative, I have to differentiate the logarithm of the absolute value of x in that case. And that's the same thing, again, for x negative as the derivative of the logarithm of negative x. That's the formula, when x is negative. And if you carry that out, what you get, maybe I'll put this over here, is, well, it's the chain rule. It's 1/(-x) times the derivative with respect to x of -x. So see that there are two minus signs.",

So the negative signs cancel. If you just keep track of this in terms of ln(-x) and its graph, that's a function that looks like this. For x negative. And its derivative is 1/x, I claim. And if you just look at it a little bit carefully, you see that the slope is always negative. Right? So here the slope is negative. So it's going to be below the axis. And, in fact, it's getting steeper and steeper negative as we go down. And it's getting less and less negative as we go horizontally. So it's going like this, which is indeed the graph of this function, for x negative. Again, x negative. So that's one other standard formula.

Now, let's do two more examples. The integral of sec^2 x dx. These are supposed to get you to remember all of your differentiation formulas, the standard ones. So this one, integral of sec^2 dx is what? tan x. And here we have + c, all right? And then the last one of, a couple of, this type would be, let's see. I should do at least this one here, square root of 1 - x^2. This is another notation, by the way, which is perfectly acceptable. Notice I've put the dx in the numerator and the function in the denominator here. So this one turns out to be sin^(-1) x. And, finally, let's see. About the integral of dx / (1 + x^2). That one is tan^(-1) x.",

You will antidifferentiate when you meant to differentiate. And you'll differentiate when you're meant to antidifferentiate. Don't get too frustrated by that. But eventually, you'll get them squared away. And it actually helps to do a lot of practice with antidifferentiations, or integrations, as they're sometimes called. Because that will solidify your remembering all of the differentiation formulas. So, last bit of information that I want to emphasize before we go on some more complicated examples is this. It's obvious because the derivative of a constant is 0. That the antiderivative is ambiguous up to a constant. But it's very important to realize that this is the only ambiguity that there is.",

The theorem is if F' = G', then F equals G-- so F(x) equals G(x) plus a constant. But that means, not only that these are antiderivatives, all these things with these plus c's are antiderivatives. But these are the only ones. Which is very reassuring. And that's a kind of uniqueness, although its uniqueness up to a constant, it's acceptable to us. Now, the proof of this is very quick. But this is a fundamental fact. The proof is the following. If F' = G', then if you take the difference between the two functions, its derivative, which of course is F' -",

It's a very, very important thing. It's the basis for calculus. It's the reason why calculus make sense. If we didn't have the fact that the derivative is 0 implied that the function was constant, we would be done. We would have-- Calculus would be just useless for us. The point is, the rate of change is supposed to determine the function up to this starting value. So this conclusion is very important. And we already checked it last time, this conclusion. And now just by algebra, I can rearrange this to say that F(x) is equal to G(x) plus a constant.",

Namely, the integral of x^a is equal to this. And even if it were a negative power, we could do it. So it's OK. On the other hand, to expand the 5th power here is quite a mess.

But for the purposes of this unit, we're only going to use one method. Which is very good. That means whenever you see an integral, either you'll be able to divine immediately what the answer is, or you'll use this method. So this is it. The trick is called the method of substitution. And it is tailor-made for notion of differentials. So tailor-made for differential notation. The idea is the following. I'm going to to define a new function. And it's the messiest function that I see here. It's u = x^4 + 2. And then, I'm going to take its differential and what I discover, if I look at its formula, and the rule for differentials, which is right here.",

So how does that happen? Well, this integral is the same thing as, well, really I should combine it the other way. So let me move this over. So there are two pieces here. And this one is u^5. And this one is 1/4 du. Now, that makes it the integral of u^5 du / 4. And that's relatively easy to integrate. That is just a power. So let's see. It's just 1/20 u to the-- whoops, not 1/20. The antiderivative of u^5 is u^6. With the 1/6, so it's 1/24 u^6 + c. Now, that's not the answer to the question. It's almost the answer to the question.",

It leads to the integral of u^(-1/2) du. Is everybody seeing where this...? However, there is a slightly better method. So recommended method. And I call this method advanced guessing. What advanced guessing means is that you've done enough of these problems that you can see two steps ahead. And you know what's going to happen. So the advanced guessing leads you to believe that here you had a power -1/2, here you have the differential of the thing. So it's going to work out somehow. And the advanced guessing allows you to guess that the answer should be something like this. (1 + x^2)^(1/2). So this is your advanced guess. And now you just differentiate it, and see whether it works.",

And so the answer is square root of (1 + x^2) + c. Let me illustrate this further with another example. I strongly recommend that you do this, but you have to get used to it. So here's another example. e^(6x) dx. My advanced guess is e^(6x). And if I check, when I differentiate it, I get 6e^(6x). That's the derivative. And so I know that the answer, so now I know what the answer is. It's 1/6 e^(6x) + c. Now, OK, you could, it's also OK, but slow, to use a substitution, to use u = 6x.",

So various people have said 1/2, and they understand that there's 1/2 going here. But let me just show you what happens, OK?

And I can guarantee you, having watched this on various problems, that people who don't write this out make arithmetic mistakes. In other words, there is a limit to how much people can think ahead and guess correctly. Another way of doing it, by the way, is simply to write this thing in and then fix the coefficient by doing the differentiation here. That's perfectly OK as well. All right, one more example. We're going to integrate sin x cos x dx. So what's a good guess for this one? STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Someone suggesting sin^2 x. So let's try that. Over 2 - well, we'll get the coefficient in just a second. So sin^2 x, if I differentiate, I get 2 sin x cos x. So that's off by a factor of 2. So the answer is 1/2 sin^2 x.",

That's not what you want to do, though. You don't want to add them. You want to subtract them. So let's see what happens when you subtract them. I'm going to ignore the c, for the time being. I get sin^2 x, 1/2 sin^2 x - (-1/2 cos^2 x). So the difference between them, we hope to be 0. But actually of course it's not 0. What it is, is it's 1/2 sine squared plus cosine squared, which is 1/2. It's not 0, it's a constant. So what's really going on here is that these two formulas are the same. But you have to understand how to interpret them. The two constants, here's a constant up here. There's a constant, c_1 associated to this one. There's a different constant, c_2 associated to this one. And this family of functions for all possible c_1's and all possible c_2's, is the same family of functions. Now, what's the relationship between c_1 and c_2? Well, if you do the subtraction, c_1 - c_2 has to be equal to 1/2. They're both constants, but they differ by 1/2.",

So there can be several formulas that actually are the same. And it's hard to check that they're actually the same. You need some trig identities to do it. Let's do one more example here. Here's another one. Now, you may be thinking, and a lot of people are, thinking ugh, it's got a ln in it. If you're experienced, you actually can read off the answer just the way there were several people who were shouting out the answers when we were doing the rest of these problems.",

And there's only one method. Which is substitution. And in the substitution method, you want to go for the trickiest part. And substitute for that. So the substitution that I proposed to you is that this should be, u should be ln x. And the advantage that that has is that its differential is simpler than itself. So du = dx / x. Remember, we use that in logarithmic differentiation, too. So now we can express this using this substitution. And what we get is, the integral of, so I'll divide the two parts here. It's 1 / ln x, and then it's dx / x. And this part is 1 / u, and this part is du. So it's the integral of du / u. And that is ln u + c. Which altogether, if I put back in what u is, is ln (ln x) + c.",
