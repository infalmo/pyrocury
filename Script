**this will be our script for the video - feel free to make edits
**I'm writing it in the style of a tutorial on how to use Pyrocury, and then some segments in between that explain that our program 
**is making the video faster/slower based on info density. So the demo and the tutorial work hand-in-hand


Hey everyone, this is a tutorial on how to use Pyrocury

*Switch to a different filter/frame*

Warning: this tutorial will contain multiple scenes that you will desperately want to speed up, and others that you will want to slow down, based on how much information is coming at you. Good news: we’ve done this for you! Based on the information density of each segment of this video,

*write very short description of information density on the slide*

our program has sped up or slowed down the video for you. 

*Switch back to original filter/frame*

First, we want to thank our sponsors, McDonalds and Burger King, for their help in producing this video. It couldn’t have been possible without them. I’m so grateful to have this chance to teach you all about how to use Pyrocury today.
